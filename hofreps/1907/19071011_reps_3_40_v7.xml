                        <para>- I should like to ask the Treasurer a question of which I regret I have not had an opportunity to give notice. In view of the decision of the Committee of Ways and Means last night, fey which the general Tariff on wire netting was fixed at 10 per cent., and on wive netting from the United Kingdom at 5 per cent., and, in view of the voluntary proposal of the Government to reduce their ( excessive Tariff ot 30 and 25 per cent, to' 15 and 10 per cent, respectively, I desire to know whether, under the exceptional circumstances, the Government can see their way to refund the excess duty which has already been collected throughout the Common- wealth ? </para>

                            <para>A new trade combine is controlling the retail prices of infant and invalid foods and of patent medicines and similar things, generally classed under the heading of " proprietary articles." The wholesale distributors of imported and locally made goods are combined for trade reasons under the style of the "P.A.T.A.," which means the " Proprietary Articles Trade Association." The association has issued a printed circular, in which it is demanded that all retailers selling any of a very long list of foods, patent medicines, pills and ointments, Stc, shall do so at certain prices which are stated. Failing, compliance with this requirement, retailers have been told that they will not be allowed to sell goods at all. They will not' be supplied with them. That is made an absolute ultimatum, and became operative today. </para>

                                <para>- My attention has been called to this matter. Honorable members can easily understand that, owing to the preference provisions and the changes in the Tariff, there is naturally some little difficulty, and that the same expedition cannot be observed as under the old Tariff. However, instructions . were given, on t.he introduction of the Tariff, to engage extra men, and to do everything to expedite business. As far as I can see, that result has been achieved to a great extent, because there is not a tithe of the complaints from merchants that were made when the old Tariff was introduced. I shall make further inquiries', because the delay mentioned by the honorable member is certainly long; I can promise the House that everything that can be done to expedite business in a reasonable way, shall be done. </para>

I have stated very definitely that the Commonwealth will control its own land and buildings. I really do not know whether the honorable member is as capable as the honorable member for Kooyong of making a joke, but the person who wrote that paragraph must certainly have been joking. </para>

                    <para>- In accordance with the promise which I made a day or two ago, when honorable members were invited to give preferential consideration to the item of wire netting - an item which has since been disposed of - I intend to test the feeling of the Committee as to the desirableness of taking certain other items out of the order in which they appear in the schedule. There are some items of vast importance to the-  industries to which they relate, and in connexion with which anomalies have arisen. I therefore move - </para>

                <para>I recognise that these do not represent all the items in the 'Tariff which are probably deserving of immediate consideration, but they certainly ought to be accorded preferential treatment. For instance, item 234 relates to kerosene. I have no hesitation in saying that the impost on that commodity is unjustifiable, that it presses heavily on the poorest section of the community, and is calculated only to further enrich a company the operations of which art world wide. </para>

                        <para>- I have not sought the consent of any one. I have briefly outlined my objections to the duty on kerosene, and since there is no reasonable prospect of the retention of the item, I think that we should remove it without delay. Item 177 relates to mining machinery, and part of the Government proposals in reference to it are absolutely unjustifiable. I do not wish to suggest that I oppose the whole of the proposals of the Government respecting duties on machinery for mining purposes. I shall be prepared to give reasonable consideration to a proposition to grant effective protection in respect of the necessities of the mining industry which can be produced in Australia, but I certainly object to duties on machinery which there is no reasonable chance of producing here. As to the item of electrical machinery, which I have included in my amendment, I would remind the Committee that the efforts of the Australian States to meet our growing requirements -in this respect are very limited. Having regard to the enormous developments in the manufacture and utilization of electrical machinery in other parts of the world, the Australian market is not sufficient to justify the erection of the plant necessary to supply all the electrical machinery and appliances that . we require. If that be so, and I believe I have expressed the view of the majority of honorable members, why should we not take the item out of its order? Then we have item 352, magazines. Although I do not say that I shall vote for magazines being placed on the free list, I am satisfied that the Government proposition as it stands is most unfair. </para>

                        <para>- Importers of certain magazines which, if introduced as originally published, would be dutiable, are allowed to mutilate them by cutting out pages of advertisements, and so escaping the impost. To my mind, however, a tax imposed by law should be removed by law and not by an act of administration. The Government proposal in regard to chairs is about as clumsy a scheme as one could possibly conceive of. I am satisfied that it will be varied, and T fail to see why the Ministry should not be prepared to adopt my amendment that preferential consideration be given to the item. It is certainly desirable that the half-dozen items enumerated in my amendment should receive preferential consideration. They all are important, and as many of them are low down on the list, and in. ordinary circumstances would not be reached for some time, I think that the Committee should be prepared to take the course I propose. </para>

                    <para>. - The motion submitted by the . honorable member for Kalgoorlie has my sympathy, but at present I do not propose to deal with it on its merits. I wish to point out the difficulty which results from  the honorable member submitting a proposal that half-a-dozen items be taken out of their order in the schedule. Many of us might desire to substitute other items for some of those enumerated by him. I wish to ask you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> for the information of the Committee, whether it will not be competent for any honorable member to move the postponement of all items prior to any particular item to which, he desires preference to be given. Will it not be competent for an honorable member to take that step from time to time and so to overcome the difficulty associated with the selection for preferential treatment of half-a-dozen . items which may not be unanimously supported by the Committee? </para>

We wish in every way to meet the desire of the Committee, but we were told again and again that we. made a mistake in allowing preferential consideration to be given to the item of wire-netting - a step which we took under circumstances of which honorable members are well aware. So much time was occupied in discussing the proposed postponement of other items in order that that relating -to wire-netting might be disposed of, that the Government have absolutely made up their minds to deal with the remaining items in the order in  which they appear in the schedule, although it may . be necessary for me to bring forward the Excise duties relating to certain divisions just as we did in connexion with the consideration of the tobacco duties. The Government, however, cannot now agree to any item being taken out of its order. A moment's reflection should be sufficient, to satisfy honorable members that the adoption of the course proposed by the honorable member for Kalgoorlie would not expedite the determination of the Tariff. I am as anxious as any honorable member to dispose of the items of the Tariff quickly, but I feel that by considering them out of their order we should not conserve the time of the Committee.

                    <para>.- When resisting the proposal to give precedence to the consideration of wire-netting the other evening, I stated that the Tariff had evidently been framed upon scientific lines, and that the items which most materially affected the public ran consecutively. But the amount of pathos which was imported into the debate on behalf of the wire-netting manufacturers was such that only four members voted against the Treasurer's proposal. Apparently the Committee is seized with only one idea. The consideration which an industry is to receive is evidently to be measured by its strength. The honorable member for Robertson desires to give precedence to the consideration of the duty upon kerosene. Instead of pouring oil upon the troubled waters, I shall endeavour to pour a little kerosene upon the embers of indignation- </para>

                        <para>- We have never before witnessed such a blaze as occurred during the discussion of the duty upon wire netting. The tremulo and the top notes of Mary Ann were both introduced on behalf of the struggling settlers of Australia, but not one word was said in the interests of the general public. This morning we have had three startling announcements from the Treasurer. In the first place, he has declared that the Government have made up their mind. That fact is worth dwelling upon. It will come as a revelation to some honorable members that the Government have a mind to make up. But we have been told by the Treasurer, not only that they have a mind, but that they have actually made it up. I only wish that the\ had made it up in regard to the question of wire-netting. The Treasurer has also announced that the Government will resist certain proposals to the end. To what end? To their own end, or to that of the debate? I will stake my existence that if honorable members intimate that they wish to accord precedence to any particular item of the Tariff, the Government will not resist it to their own end. The Treasurer also made a reference to the possibility of the Ministry being turned out of office. Any Government which introduces a Tariff of this description, which imposes such heavy taxation upon the necessaries of life, deserve to be driven out of office. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for South Sydney took good care when it was proposed to give precedence to the consideration of wire-netting not to vote with the minority of four. When the members of the Labour Party are upon the public platform nobody could be. more declamatory than they are concerning attacks upon the interests of the working classes. If the Government agree to accord' precedence to any particular item in the .Tariff we shall find all sorts of interests in the community clamouring for priority. Every business concern in Australia will have a right to ask that its interests shall be considered first. What an intolerable position that would be. There is a very easy way of prolonging this discussion, namely, by moving amendments such as were submitted the other evening in respect of wire-netting. But I have no desire to adopt that course. I say that precedence should not be given to the consideration of any particular item, but that the discussion of the Tariff should be proceeded with in the order in which it has been framed as rapidly as possible. Why should this Tariff be "peacocked?" My vote will be given against any peacocking of the Tariff, even if the Government is willing to allow that to be done. I hope that the items will be dealt with in the order in which they stand in the schedule. ' </para>

                    <para>.- I shall not support the motion of the honorable member for Kalgoorlie. In the first place, to my mind, if it were desirable to take certain items out of their order, it does not include all the items to which preference should be given. For though I should like to see the kerosene duties dealt with as soon as possible, duties which, in my opinion, are even more important than the duties on wire-netting with which we have dealt, and while I should be glad for the Committee to deal as soon as possible with the other duties which the honorable member enumerated, I think that the timber duties should also be dealt with speedily. Oregon timber is very largely used in the district which I represent, and, in the interests of my constituents, I should like the Committee' to come to a speedy decision in regard to the duty on it. I intend to move the reduction of duties on electrical and mining machinery, and on other items, but, for the reason I have given, I shall not vote for the motion. Another reason why I shall not support it is that we have no right to take the business out of the hands of. the Government unless we wish to remove the present Ministers from power. </para>

                        <para>- The Treasurer has said so, and I cannot conceive that even this Ministry has so little sense of honour that it would remain in office if a motion were carried against it after a declaration of that sort. Therefore, if the honorable member on pressing the motion to a division succeeded in carrying it, he would defeat his own ends. I do not know if he would be sent for if the Government were to resign, but, in any case, a change in the Administration would mean a delay of some weeks. I regard the pro posed duties on kerosene and magazines as iniquitous and idiotic, and would like to see them removed without delay; but the most expeditious way of proceeding with the Tariff is to deal with its various items* in their order, and to sit longer hours. In my opinion, we might reasonably be expected to sit six days a week. </para>

                        <para>- If we are to deal with a question like the Tariff effectually, and bring the discussion to a close, the only way is to allow the Government to arrange the order of business. Of course, there are a number of items to which honorable members, including myself, would prefer to give precedence; but the only parliamentary method is to allow the Government, so long as they continue in office, to decide the order in which business shall be submitted. The amendment really means a waste of time. </para>

                        <para>- At present, I am not discussing butter, but glucose. It has been urged that glucose is used as an adulterant; and I believe that in America it is mixed with honey. In Australia, however, with the duty proposed, there is no possibility of glucose being used for the adulteration of foodstuffs. A fair amount of . glucose is used in the manufacture of confectionery, though not as an adulterant. It is used for sweetening purposes where sugar cannot be used, and if this duty be imposed, it will mean a larger demand for sugar. Glucose is produced from maize, and as a large quantity of the latter is grown in Australia, the time must be very near when it will be possible to convert it into pure glucose. </para>

I know there are honorable members who have an idea that this duty ought to be altered ; and I think that if I make a few remarks now, some time may be saved. Glucose is a kind of sugar, though not so sweet. It may be produced also from dried grapes, cane sugar, and similar material. </para>

As I have said, I had occasion to deal with glucose as a matter df administration when I was at the Department of Trade and Customs, and I then learnt that it could be manufactured from very deleterious materials. </para>

                    <para>. - This item does not involve the question of free-trade or protection. The Treasurer has made a very fair statement, but he has not told us all the purposes to which glucose may be applied. Iri the first place, glucose is largely used in the manufacture of beer, because it is cheaper, although the beer thus produced is not so good as that made from sugar. 'Glucose is also used as an adulterant for leather, for the purpose of perpetrating fraud on the public. Some classes of leather, when ready for manufacture, are dry, and, in order to soften them, glucose in a form very like that of Dutch cheese, is absorbed into it, to the extent of, perhaps, 2 lbs. or 3 lbs. to 15 lbs. or 16 lbs. of leather. If glucose is worth 3d. per lb., and leather is sold at od. per lb., we see that the adulteration gives an advantage to the manufacturer of leather ; and it is the presence of glucose which accounts for so many flies in cobblers'' shops. I am informed by those in the confectionery business that 20 per cent, of glucose is used in the manufacture cf sweets. </para>

                        <para>- I have been informed by men in in the trade that in most of the better classes of confectionery 20 per cent, of glucose is used, but that it is absent from the common varieties. Boiled lollies, for instance, are made of two classes of sugar, but no glucose is employed in their manufacture. The glucose used for confectionery is of a light-grey colour, and is very waxy. It imparts to what is known as French confectionery a glossy appearance, making it shine like satin. I have had a lot to do with the importation of glucose; but until I visited confectionery works in Melbourne a few days ago I had not .seen the variety used in that trade. </para>

It is used as an adulterant in confectionery, and is an imposition on the little children who consume sweets. I would support a duty that would prevent its general use. It is of no value save for making a cheap beer, for adulterating leather, and for use in the manufacture of confectionery. I repeat that it is a wax, and not a sugar, and its use is a fraud upon the general public. I shall therefore support the Government proposal. </para>

I agree that it is improper to lead people to believe, that cane sugar is being used in certain commodities, when, as a matter of fact, glucose is substituted for it. For instance, the use of glucose in lieu of cane sugar in cordials should not be permitted. </para>

                        <para>- Because people drink cordials to obtain certain results. The States authorities should insist upon certain standards for cordials, so that the public would know what they were buying. If the public desire cordials in which cane sugar is used, they should be able to get them; and, on the other hand, those who desire to use cordials in the manufacture of which glucose has been used should have an opportunity to 'do so. So far as I have been able to ascertain glucose is non-injurious, but has not the same qualities as cane sugar. While the import duty is justifiable, I fail to recognise the propriety of imposing an Excise of £4 per ton. </para>

                        <para>- Why should we subordinate everything to the interests of Queensland sugar? I have given the growers of sugar in Queensland and also in New South Wales, every assistance, . but I think it most unfair to impose a disability in the shape of an Excise duty of £4 per ton on glucose, since it can be made from maize' grown in New South Wales or Queensland, or from potatoes produced in Tasmania, Victoria, or any of the other States. </para>

                        <para>- Some attempts may have been made, but my information is that glucose is not at present being manufactured in the Commonwealth.. I am prepared to support the duty proposed by the Government, because I believe that this is an industry which ought to be established in our midst. We produce unlimited quantities of potatoes and maize, which form the basis of glucose. The process of manufacturing this article is comparatively a simple one. The article itself enters into a great many processes, altogether 'apart from the fact that it is used as an adulterant in some cases. I entirely disagree with those who claim that glucose is unwholesome. It is true that in some processes of manufacture there remains a residue of arsenic or sulphurous acid. But I am of opinion that none of this unwholesome glucose is used in connexion with any food productions within the Commonwealth. So far as confectionery is concerned, I believe that in its manufacture one staple brand of glucose is used, and one only. I think that it is known as the "Buffalo A" brand. It is American glucose, and is preferred by confectioners chiefly because of the absence of colouring matter in it. They require a material which is free from colour, and this particular brand of glucose is produced in large quantities by a, firm in America, principally - if not entirely - for the purpose of being used in the manufacture of confectionery. It is quite true, as has been pointed out by the Treasurer, that a recommendation was made - not by both sections of the Tariff Commission, but by certain members of that body - that  the use of glucose in sweetmeats should be prohibited. I was not able to sign that recommendation, because I was of opinion that no evidence had been adduced to justify such drastic action being taken. If any danger is to be apprehended from the use of impure glucose in confectionery, the matter is one which the States Governments "ought to remedy. </para>

                        <para>- Precisely. The honorable member has stated the case very well indeed in regard to this commodity. I have very little to add except that I desire to indicate the position which I took up in regard to the recommendation of the Tariff Commission. I was unable - as I have al ready said - to support that recommendation. I think that it would be grossly unfair to confectioners who use a pure quality of glucose to impose upon them such a tax as is proposed by way of Excise. While I am prepared to support the imposition of a Customs duty of 8s. per cwt. upon that article in order to encourage its production within the Commonwealth, I certainly think that no disability should be imposed upon confectioners who use glucose in good faith, and who take care that it is of the right quality;, especially as its consumption is not attended with any injurious results. </para>

                        <para>- The suggestion that an Excise duty should be imposed must have emanated from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smart,</inline> arid him alone. Personally, I trust that the Government will agree to abolish the Excise. _ So far as. I am aware, there is no Excise" duty imposed on glucose in any other part of the world. If we prohibit the importation of that article, we must prohibit the importation of confectionery, which contains glucose. I do not think that the corifectionersof Australia would be slow to take advantage of that position of affairs. The effect of the use of glucose in the manufacture of confectionery is to keep it moist. We all know that the confectionery of to-day is not of the hard, brittle character that it was years ago. Those of us who, in our callow days, used to indulge in a little toffee making upon our own account, know that by the use of butter and sugar we could make a pretty hard toffee - so hard' that it had frequently to be broken with a hammer. The use of glucose acts as a preservative in keeping confectionery moist,. because, resembling a gum, it will not granulate as sugar will. If we "prohibit the use of glucose by our own people, we have a right to prohibit the importation of any confectionery containing glucose. Honorable members have been led to believe that the recommendation of the Tariff Commission in this connexion is based to some extent upon the evidence tendered to that body by the Government Analyst of Victoria, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilkinson.</inline> But I would point out that his latest information upon the subject dates as 'far back as  1889.  Upon page  527  of the report of the proceedings of the Tariff Commission, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilkinson</inline> makes a translation from the German <inline font-style="italic">Journal of Foods and Products.</inline> What he says in regard to glucose will be gathered from the following extract from the report -  3105. On the whole, can you say that the use of glucose is injurious ? - No, provided it contains no large proportion of sulphurous acid. In Switzerland, one of the Cantons, in 1899, passed a law dealing with its use, on the ground that starch sugar syrups had frequently shown a high content of sulphurous acid. 3106. Is it a fact that considerable quantities of foodstuffs are imported from America and the United Kingdom containing glucose ? - Yes. 3107. That is undoubtedly so? - It is. 3108. Have you any knowledge of how it happens that the German glucose is nearly twice the price of the American? - No; I have no knowledge of that. 3124. They can bring in any kind of glucose and use it all ? - Yes. There are very low grades of glucose imported here - very low grades. 3125. Are these low grades introduced into foods which are consumed by the public? - I do not know their  exact  destination. 3126. Have you any reason to believe that they enter into the production of confectionery? - I have no proof whatever on that point. </para>

                <para class="block">He admits that the cheap class of glucose is probably used in the manufacture of leather. But the most important question which he was asked was put to him by the honorable member for Perth. </para>
                <para>You know the process of methylating spirit which makes it unfit for human consumption? -Yes. </para>
                <para>Do you know of an v 'equivalent process that could be applied to glucose to make certain that it would not enter into consumption when it was inferior? - We could  easily  devise means for that. There would be no difficulty there at all. </para>
                <para class="block">The Customs Department should frame regulations to prevent the importation of inferior glucose, and I have no doubt that the manufacturers are agreeable to the imposition of reasonable restrictions. The honorable member for Batman informs me that there is a standard for glucose', so that an impure article need not be used. I' hope that the Government will agree to reduce this import duty to 6s. per cwt., and strike out the Excise duty. If the rates remain as they' are, they will be a serious handicap upon persons whose business requires them to use glucose. </para>

                    <para>.- Honorable members will agree that, if a man goes to a grocer and asks for sugar, he does not expect to get sand mixed with it, and, similarly, if he asks for glucose, he should - not be given an impure article, containing ' deleterious substances. Unfortunately in these days, food-stuffs are often improperly prepared, and things that would be wholesome in themselves become unwholesome, and even dangerous to life, because of the' impurities which they contain. The "Buffalo A" glucose, which, it is said, is that used by confectioners, has a density of  45.5  degrees, an ash of 3"5i cent., contains no arsenic, and only  14  per cent, of water; whereas under the Victorian Pure Food Act regulations, glucose must be of a density of from  41  to  45  degrees, have not more than  1  per cent, of ash, contain no arsenic, and not more than  21  per cent of water. Thus it will be seen that the " Buffalo A " glucose is purer than the standard set und'er the Victorian Act.

But while pure glucose is not harmful, the use of impure glucose should be prohibited by an Act like the Pure Foods Act of Victoria, which, although not perfect, goes a long way in the direction of perfection. If the Treasurer insists, on a duty of 8s.  per cwt., he will have my vote, because I am a protectionist up to the hilt ; but I think it would be a wise thing to reduce the Excise, in order to give greater inducement to the local manufacture of glucose. We know that potatoes are produced in Australia as cheaply as in any part of the world.

But I have known the finest potatoes to be sold in Victoria for£1 10s. a ton, and even less. </para>

                        <para>- Germany is the greatest producer of potatoes in the world, her ' production in 1.897 being about 31,800,000 tons, while that of France was only . 12,900,000 tons, that of Russia 20,700,000 tons, that of the United Kingdom  6,100,000  tons, and that of the United States  6,300,000  tons. Great Britain, Austria, and the United States, have not as large a production of potatoes as Germany. In that country, potatoes are largely converted into glucose and spirit, and they might be used it) that way here. So, too, might the grain surplus which we have in seasons of great plenty, which now is sold at prices giving but a scant profit to the growers. If the glucose industry were started in this country, it would provide a market for surplus products, and the use of pure glucose is by no means unwholesome. When glucose is pure, it is good to use, and, when impure, bad, which may be said of any food product. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that the Government will adhere to its proposals. I do not altogether agree with what has been said as to the desirability of encouraging the use of glucose as a food product, though I admit the truth "of a good deal that has been said regarding the effects of its use. Honorable members would do well to read the evidence on this subject given before the Tariff Commission by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilkinson,</inline> one of the best chemists in the State. He has given special attention to the question of the adulteration of foods, and has followed, as closely as one living in this part of the world can, the developments of latter-day science in this regard. He has made some very emphatic statements about the use of glucose. The proposed duty is not a differential one. High class glucose will be charged at the same rate as inferior or impure glucose, and glucose imported for use in confectionery will have to pav as much as glucose imported for the adulteration of leather, for which purpose _ most inferior glucose is used. I should like to see the use of glucose in connexion with the preparation of leather prohibited altogether. It is to be regretted that our leather does not hold a better place in. the markets of the world : but the fact that it is not as good as it should be is due to the use of barium and glucose in its preparation. We should do good service to our primary industries if we took such action as would secure an improvement in the quality of Australian leather. As has been pointed out, confectioners use glucose, not because of its sweetening properties, which, it is said, are only one-half - and, according to German chemists, only one-third - as strong as those of cane sugar, but because it does not crystallize so easily, and has, therefore, better keeping properties. </para>

                        <para>- There has been some talk of abolishing the Excise, but I do not agree with the suggestion. Although I am a protectionist, I feel that, in order to have some inspection of the local manufacture., it is necessary to have an Excise duty ; and in support of that view I may quote from the evidence given before the Tariff Commission by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilkinson,</inline> to whom I have already alluded - 3122. Is glucose quite as wholesome as cane sugar? - Physiologically, there is little difference if the sugars are pure, as far as' I know, but weight for weight the alimentary advantage lies with cane sugar. Glucose is so seldom pure; like starch syrup, it invariably contains more or less dextrine, which is less easily absorbed than sugar. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                </continue>
                <para class="block">That explains the reason why French confectionery is of a much more harmful character than that which is generally known as boiled confectionery. Sweets made from pure sugar are very much less harmful than the more attractive and more expensive sweets retailed under the name of French confectionery. The dental troubles to which Australians seem specially liable are in no small degree traceable to the use of those sweets. As already stated it has been found necessary in one part of Switzerland to prohibit the use of glucose ; and the reason is a very simple one. Glucose does not ferment like ordinary cane sugar, nor does it crystallize when dried or submitted to the evaporating process. That is the reason why confectioners and jam makers prefer glucose; and it is in this connexion that there is the greatest danger to our people. The following is a further extract from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilkinson's</inline> evidence - 3190. Do you think there is any danger of briquettine being used, for instance, by confectioners? - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thompson</inline> assures me that that would be utterly impossible - that glucose is only one ingredient. I presume there are many other ingredients. </para>
                <para class="block">I take my present attitude, in the first place, because I desire to restrict, as far as possible., the use of glucose, and, in the second place, where it is made locally, I should like the manufacture to be under proper supervision. Honorable members are aware that at present-and I fear we shall be in the same position for a very long time - this Parliament has no control over the adulteration of foods. That matter is administered in a more or less - and, I am very sorry to say, in most cases a less - effective fashion by the States. I am afraid we shall not find the States, as a whole, prepared to hand over that important duty to us. But, at the same time, I feel that until the administration is handed over to the Federal Parliament we shall not have that effective supervision necessary in the interests of the health of the people. </para>

                        <para>- As I have already pointed out, a person may eat three times as much sugar as glucose and not suffer in the same degree as he would from the latter. In the first place, three times as much glucose is required to secure the same degree of sweetness, and, in the second place, the process of the manufacture of glucose is, unfortunately, not always under, such supervision as to conduce to the elimination of the dangerous products, arsenic and sulphurous acid. My suggestion is that we should agree to a duty of 8s., and reduce the Excise to is. This would secure the local manufacture, and afford some guarantee that only a high-class product, which is not so dangerous, will be used. I wish, however, that there could be some differentiation with regard to quality. I do not know how that could be brought about.; but I suppose the only way would be to impose an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty. My feeling is that, if possible, we should altogether prohibit the importation of inferior glucose, which is not used as an article of food, but for the purposes of adulteration.. </para>

                        <para>- That is what I meant when I spoke of glucose being used for the purposes of adulteration. Glucose is forced into the pores of leather for the purpose of increasing the weight, and, when the unfortunate consumer goes out in a shower, the glucose disappears, and leaves him with the open pores only. I shall be very glad to- support any reasonable proposal which has for its object the prohibition of the importation of inferior glucose. </para>

                    <para>.- I hope the Committee will accept the duty as it appears in the schedule, because, in my- opinion, it will encourage local manufacture, and enable us to have some control in regard to quality. I quite agree with the honorable member for Laanecoorie as to the ills caused by the use of glucose in large quantities in " the manufacture of lollies ; but I think the honorable member's argument fails him when he suggests a reduction of the Excise to is. Any reduction of the Excise below 4s. would bring, glucose into direct competition with pure sugar, and tend to displace the latter. </para>

                    <para>.- If we support the proposed duty from a' protective point of view, we must get rid of most of the Excise. A movement was made last year with a view to forming a cooperative company, composed of growers of maize and users of glucose, for the establishment of a factory for the manufacture of the latter. At that time the import duty on glucose was 8s:, and so far as was known there was no Excise duty ; but the recommendation that there should be an Excise checked the movement. . It has been pointed out to me by those connected with the proposed company that they have to pay about <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> a ton more for maize in Australia than in America,- so that really there would be a duty equal to about 2s. only, which, of course, is of no use for protective purposes. At the present time, I am informed, some ^£30,000 worth of glucose is imported, and' this is made entirely out of maize in the corn States of America. </para>

                    <para>.- I cannot allow this item to pass without a protest against the proportion of the sugar duties to the Excise. The Government almost promised to give some indication of a new policy. When the honorable member for Swan was Treasurer there was some idea of abolishing the Excise, and, I think, of lowering the import duty, though I am not sure on the latter point. It would be just as well for honorable members to consider the position in regard to sugar. </para>

I did not quite understand that item  28  had been put to the Committee, and I had intended to ask honorable members to postpone all intervening items, in order to deal with the Excise on glucose, as the more convenient method of conducting the business. If I can get permission, I shall submit a motion to that effect, as, it will be remembered, I did in the case of tobacco. </para>

                            <para>- Under the old Tariff there was no Excise an glucose, and it did not compete with sugar. Last year only about  3,000  tons were imported, and I believe that for the most part it was used in the manufacture of confectionery. We should be far more likely to obtain a pure glucose if we supplied our own requirements. For these reasons I am willing to agree to a reduction of the Excise dutv to 1s. per cwt. By imposing an Excise duty we shall give the Customs authorities power to supervise the industry in a way that would not otherwise be possible. </para>

It cannot be -denied that in England some years ago, owing to attempts to prepare this commodity in a certain way, arsenic was introduced, and carried into the glucose and from that into beer, with very serious consequences to the use of, not only glucose, but of beer. That state of affairs, however, has passed away. It is a. well-known scientific fact that glucose can be produced in a perfectly wholesome way. The manufacturers would be the last in the world to produce an unwholesome article. </para>

                            <para>- At all events, it must be an exceedingly slow poison, since the greater proportion of confectionery made here, as well as in Europe, is composed largely of glucose. It is made from materials that are largely produced in Australia. In Germany, it is made chiefly from potatoes, and in the . United States of America from maize. The starch from potatoes and maize yields exactly the same chemical product known as glucose. An Excise duty may be justifiable from a revenue stand-point- </para>

                            <para>- Supervision is unnecessary. The process of manufacture is a purely chemical one. First of all, the maize has to be treated in a certain way to extract the starch which it contains, and to that starch certain chemicals have to be  added to produce the sugar. I am not going to advise the Committee to adopt one course or the other, but I think honorable members should know that the alarmist reports with regard to the effect of glucose, and the necessity for supervising its manufacture, are beside the question. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot say. The Treasurer said just now that last year about 3,000 tons were imported. My impression is, however, that the average importation is about 2,300 tons, and I am sure that the small local demand would not justify a large expenditure on the plant necessary to produce the article. If the industry were established here, I see no reason why we should not in time be able to export glucose just as well as do the United States of America or Germany. The honorable member for Laanecoorie referred to an inferior class of glucose which is a special product made for certain industrial purposes, and which cannot be used in the manufacture of confectionery. </para>

                            <para>- The inferior glucose to which I refer is used amongst other things for the preparation of leather. I am not an expert in leather, but I am informed that, whilst the use of a large quantity of glucose in the preparation of leather is objectionable, a certain proportion is necessary. -The inferior glucose is made only for a special purpose. But MacRobertson and other confectioners would never dream of using in the manufacture of their confectionery glucose which was made for the purpose of stiffening leather. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. It can be methylated. It seems to me that if we reduce the Excise dutv to1s. per cwt. it will not produce much revenue, and Excise supervision is not necessary. I should have preferred to see the Customs duties lowered to 6s., and the Excise abolished. When honorable members talk lightly about levying an Excise duty they apparently forget that its imposition involves a great deal more to the manufacturer than the mere payment of the Excise. They forget that the manufacturer has to pay for the services of a Customs officer., that he is  obliged to work during Customs hours, and that he is subjected to many incidental disabilities. As a matter of fact, he is called upon to pay, in charges of various kinds, a considerable sum in addition to the amount of the Excise. If the Excise upon glucose is fixed at£4 per ton, it may easily happen that these charges will represent another <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> per ton. </para>

                            <para>- No. I do not believe that any satisfactory solution of these difficulties will be found until the Commonwealth assumes control of such questions. Any honorable member who has special knowledge in regard to this question is not treating the country fairly if he withholds that knowledge. I wish the Committee to understand that I have not been briefed by anybody. But I feel that a certain responsibility rests upon me, and I have, therefore, done my best to give honorable members the benefit of the information in my possession. </para>

                        <para>. - I speak upon this question with considerable diffidence, because I recognise that a little knowledge is a very dangerous thing. Upon general principles, I think it would be a mistake to impose heavy Excise duties upon articles in conjunction with high protective duties. If our object is merely to  protect local manufacturers, surely it is better to increase the Customs duties than to bring an Excise system into operation. During this debate the point has been raised as to whether an Excise should not be imposed upon glucose, with a view to prevent the circulation in our midst of injurious materials. I cannot see that we possess power under the Customs Act 10 examine such materials from the standpoint of quality. My own impression is that it will be far better for us to impose upon this article a sufficient mea'sure of protection. Undoubtedly glucose ought to be produced in Australia. I regret that the Treasurer has come forward with a new proposal. Surely, when he submits a proposal, he should stand to it. Certainly he ought not to abandon it the moment it is attacked by honorable members upon the other side of the Chamber. </para>

                            <para>- I am desirous of placing no impost on the manufacture of glucose, because I think that it will be better to have it made in the Commonwealth, in accordance with the requirements of our health laws, and under the best conditions, than to continue to import it. According to a letter which has been handed to me by the honorable member for Herbert, an attempt is to be made to establish a glucose factory in Australia. To manufacture the glucose now used in the Commonwealth, 200,000 bushels of maize would be required. Therefore the industry would enable our farmers to get rid of their surplus produce, and its establishment would be of immense advantage to a district like Gippsland. So far as I am aware, in no other part of the world is an Excise imposed on the manufacture of glucose. I could understand the imposition of an Excise to secure proper labour conditions, but without a statement from the Minister that this Excise has been imposed for that reason,  and will not be levied where fair  condi-tions  are observed, 1 shall vote against the proposal. </para>

                        <para>. - The honorable member for Mernda said that he believes that the use of glucose is essential for the production of good leather. We know that a good deal has been heard about our leather being refused in England, and I believe that the Board of Trade had some dispute with the Minister of Trade and Customs in regard to it, because of the quantity of glucose in it. As a matter of fact, the best leather is made without glucose, which is used by tanners to load hides in order to make them heavy. </para>

                            <para>- The grain side is that on which a finish is put, but glucose is applied to the flesh side of sole leather. It is used, not to stiffen or dress the leather, but to bleach it, to give it a light colour, and to add weight to it. A side of leather will take as much as 3 lbs. of glucose. At one time, glucose was not used in Australia, and there was then a great demand for Australian leather, English importers buying it, and making a good profit by loading it with glucose. Now, however,  it is  loaded here. But the best leather is not loaded.  Glucose is applied when the leather is practically finished. The honorable member for Mernda said that there were different qualities. That is true of almost every commodity. But he told us that the quality applied to leather is different from that used by brewers. Yet I know from personal knowledge of brewers arid .tanners being  supplied  from the same consignment. The same class of glucose as is used for loading leather is used in the manufacture of beer. The honorable member for Laanecoorie read the evidence of a Government analyst to show that glucose is injurious to health if it contains certain impurities. But its unwholesomeness is a question of degree. Last week, on visiting a confectionery factory, I learned that 20 per cent, of glucose is contained in the sweetmeat known as "milk kisses," while in French confectionery there is even more. As children' will consume as many sweets as they can obtain, it is undoubtedly  injurious  to allow them to eat- lollies in which there is a large quantity of glucose. As for the sample exhibited in this Chamber, it seems to me to have been diluted. Starch and sulphurous acid are used in the manufacture of glucose. Sulphuric acid is volatile, but if diluted with water it causes the pores of the skin of' both human beings and animals to open, and when used for rapid curing, enables alum, salt, and other things to be worked into the leather very quickly. </para>

                        <para>.- I am surprised at the position in which we find ourselves in this matter. Those of us who are protectionists desire to do what we can to give reasonable opportunities for the establishment of industries, but we shall be placed in a very strange position if we follow the Government. It is pot necessary to refer to what took place last night in regard to the wire-netting duty ; it is sufficient for my purpose to point out that, although for the last six years there has been an import duty of 8s. per cwt. on glucose, and no Excise, not 1 lb. has 'been manufactured in Australia, and yet the Government propose to further encourage the industry by leaving the import duty as it is, and imposing an Excise of 4s. per cwt., which would be equivalent to reducing the import duty by one-half. </para>

                            <para>- At any rate, the Treasurer appears to be moving in the direction of acting on those " intelligent ideas." As soon as a little opposition is set up, the Government drop from 4s. to is., and, perhaps, if there be a little further protestation, they may be prepared to abolish the Excise altogether. This appears to me to be a most extraordinary state of affairs ; because, on the merits of the proposal, there seems no justification for reducing the protection given to this industry, either by reducing the import duty, or imposing an Excise. I am not prepared to say whether large quantities of glucose are advantageous to the community; scientists and analysts are the only persons who can decide the question with any degree of accuracy. But if the industry has not been established with a duty of 8s. without Excise, it is absurd to expect to establish it by imposing an Excise duty. </para>

                        <para>.- The suggestion of the Treasurer is a step in the right direction, but he does not go far enough. I am inclined to agree with the 'honorable member for Kooyong that there should be no Excise duty. Glucose is an important portion of the raw materials of the confectionery industry, and it is desirable that it should be obtained as cheaply as possible. If we impose an Excise duty, it must affect the price; and that is a fact we must bear in mind. If I proposed to commence the glucose industry, I should pay regard to all the surrounding circumstances; and an Excise duty will act as somewhat of a handicap. In the first- place, an Excise officer will either be permanently at the factory or call from day to day. Then the representative of the State health authorities will look in to see whether the product is being manufactured under proper sanitary conditions, and they will be followed by the inspectors under the Factories Acts, who- are concerned about a proper rate of. °wages, and so forth. Finally, the manufacturer will have to comply with all the requirements of the new protection. If we really desire to encourage the manufacture of glucose - and I am one who has that desire - it would be better to have no Excise duty, when, at any rate, one visiting official would be rendered unnecessary. This is a good, clean industry, which does no harm to anybody, and it might well be encouraged, with a view to insuring a regular and cheap supply of glucose, so that those engaged in the confectionery industry may be able to compete on fair terms with the outside world. I do not feel very seriously as to the Excise of is., but, for the reasons I have stated, it would be as well if it were not imposed. </para>

                        <para>.- The question appears to be whether an Excise duty is necessary in order to give the Commonwealth Government the right to supervise the industry. In my opinion, an Excise duty is not necessary on that ground, though, of course, I suppose I must accept the Treasurer's assurance to the contrary. In my opinion, all that is necessary to give the Commonwealth the control desired is an import duty, which will bring the industry under the terms of the new protection. It seems to me that if there is to be a measure. to counteract the iniquities of protection, <inline font-style="italic">-per se,</inline> the provisions of that measure will be quite sufficient to cover the case of glucose, and., therefore, no Excise duty is necessary. I understand that the Government are anxious to encourage, and not to handicap, the glucose industry, and that the Excise duty is proposed merely in order to give Federal control. But if it is necessary to have an Excise duty for that purpose in the case of glucose, it is necessary in the case of every product the manufacture of which we protect. I have never conceived that to be the case, and I cannot conceive it to be the case now. I ask the Treasurer to make it quite clear to honorable members whether it is necessary to have an Excise duty as well as an import duty, in order to give proper control over the manufacture. My own idea is that the new protection scheme outlined by the Government ought to be comprehensive enough to meet all cases. </para>

                        <para>.- There is no need to enter on a discussion of the chemical and other properties of glucose. We have already agreed to a duty of  8s.,  and we now have the Excise proposal before us ;' and the whole is resolved into a question of protection. We are attempting to impose an Excise duty on a commodity which, we have been authoritatively informed in the House, is not yet manufactured in Australia.  The policy of the country is to induce the establishment of any and every possible industry ; and when industries are established and successful, let us then, if circumstances justify the step, apply the principle of ari Excise duty. The position is one which the Government ought seriously to consider. What is the use of imposing an Excise duty on a commodity which is not yet manufactured here, and which,, as we have been told on good authority, involves a large and expensive plant? </para>

                        <para>.- If the Government desire to obtain knowledge of the conditions under which this manufacture is carried on, there ought to be an Excise duty. I would point out, however, that this Excise duty will not give control over the process of manufacture. This duty falls under the general Excise Act, which is different from the Distillation Act and some of the other measures. In the Distillation Act, for instance, there is a distinct provision as to the percentage of wine necessary to secure a certain standard of purity. In the only case in which the Courts have tested the matter, the decision was against the power we are assuming in proposing this Excise. But, assuming that we may have control, the Government are not securing it, because all that they are doing is to provide for observation. If they wish to control the industry, so far as we have power, they ought to have two. classes of Excise, one to fall at a lower rate, or free, on glucose manufactured according to departmental by-laws, and the other to be ordinary Excise on glucose not so manufactured. There is a similar provision in regard to other items in the Tariff; and it would cover the possibility of the manufacturer of glucose laughing at us on the ground that, under the Tariff, we have no power to control the manufacture itself. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so. I have no hesitation in saying that, no matter how pure it may be, it is not as wholesome as sugar. I base that statement on my own experience, as well as on the views of authorities upon this subject. I do not suggest that if it be free from the impurities' to which reference has been made, it is a highly deleterious article, but I' do say that it is not as wholesome as sugar. Under the Customs Act, power is given to the Minister to direct that substitutes for any dutiable article shall be liable to the duty chargeable on that dutiable article; yet we propose to extend entirely different treatment to glucose, a substitute for sugar. To impose an Excise of only <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> per ton would be to give a premium tp the production of what is not as good an article of consumption as is sugar, the growth of which we have encouraged at a very large expenditure. </para>

                            <para>- At all events, the gentleman in question, who was verv anxious that the import duty on glucose should be reduced, has informed me that he pays <inline font-style="italic">£22</inline> per ton for it. The duty on glucose is <inline font-style="italic">£8</inline> per ton, whilst sugar is liable to an import du'tv of <inline font-style="italic">£6</inline> per ton. The import duty on this commodity will yield some revenue, and at the same time afford some protection to the industry. I understand, however, that glucose cannot be produced as cheaply as sugar. </para>

                            <para>- Last year 3,000 tons were imported, and therefore it does not seem probable that glucose will seriously compete with sugar. Under the Tariff of 1902, there was no Excise duty upon it, but the right honorable member for Adelaide, when Minister of Trade and Customs, issued an order that it should be liable to an Excise of <inline font-style="italic">£3</inline> per ton. That subsequently . was' found to be <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline> I think it is desirable to impose an Excise duty, and to have some supervision over the industry. </para>

                            <para>- I have just said that the order issued by the right honorable member for Adelaide, that an Excise of£3 per ton should be collected, was found to be <inline font-style="italic">ultravires.</inline> It has been said that it interfered with any serious attempt to manufacture glucose in Australia. The honorable member for Kalgoorlie has twitted the Government- I hope in no spirit of real antagonism - with altering its own Tariff. He has made that statement more than once, and I do not think it is altogether fair. It is true that, in regard to the item of wire-netting, concerning which there was a very serious difference of opinion and a great agitation, we offered to make a reduction ; but the position is different in regard to the other items with which we have dealt. We rearranged the divisions relating to tobacco and spirits in order to improve them. </para>

                            <para>- I was just about to mention that point. Iri framing a Tariff, the responsible Minister can have only the assistance of his officers, since absolute secrecy has to be observed. As soon as it has been introduced, however, we are able to bring to bear upon it the experience of the people generally, . and a Minister who refused to rectify what was shown to be a mistake would not befit to remain in charge of such a measure. I recognise that the Minister in charge of a Tariff should stand by his principles, but surely he should be prepared to make any reasonable re-arrangement that is calculated to improve his proposals. Now is the time to make such alterations. It is impossible for the Ministry to be familiar with every detail in the working of the Tariff. </para>

I saw, some time ago, a report of a deputation which waited upon the ex-Treasurer at Brisbane, and suggested that the Excise provisions were not the best for that State. I am speaking of what I read in the newspapers, and I say that a deputation waited upon the honorable member for Swan, at which the suggestion was made that possibly am import duty without any Excise would suit the Queensland sugar industry better than does the present arrangement. </para>

                            <para>- Not only did I see the statement made publicly, but men who are directly connected with the industry have assured me that they would prefer to have an import dutv without the Excise. I have been informed that as the result of the protection which is given to the industry in Queensland - and I do not for a moment suggest that the planters get the full benefit of that protection - sugar is being sold by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company in Australia at a much greater price per ton than that at which it is being sold in South Africa. I have had what appears to be proof of that statement supplied to me by a. man on whose abilitv and integrity I can place absolute reliance. I ask the Government to see that, inasmuch as we are protecting the sugar industry in Queensland and New South Wales, the people of the Commonwealth get the benefit of any possible reduction in price. The only reasonable deduction which can be drawn from some of the invoices which I have seen is that sugar is being entered at Durban, by purchasers from the Colonial Sugar Refining Company at £11 per ton. The freight charges from Australia to that port amount to £r 4s. per ton. The price of this article in Durban ought to be the price at which it is sold in the Commonwealth, plus the freight charges. </para>

                            <para>- I am very careful in my choice of words in this connexion. I merely say that sugar is being sold by purchasers from the Colonial Sugar Refining Company at Durban for £11 per ton. An officer in the Customs Department has, I understand, suggested that possibly the company may have imported this sugar, refined it, and then exported it. But nothing to that effect appears in the information which has been supplied to me. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. Of course, it may be said that it is not sugar which has been manufactured by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. That may be perfectly true. All I can sav is that one of the Customs officials was so astounded with the fact that he suggested that possibly the company had imported the sugar, refined it, and then exported it. I merely ask that the matter should be inquired into. The position is that sugar is being sold by the company at £11 per ton in South Africa. If we deduct from that amount the cost of the freight charges, namely, <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> 4s. per ton, it will leave <inline font-style="italic">£9 16s.</inline> per ton. If we add to that sum the £4 per ton Excise - and I am not sure that the Excise is not rebated - that would make the price of the article in Australia. £13 1 6s. per ton,  as  against <inline font-style="italic">£20</inline> per ton, which I  am  informed is about the actual price. If, under the new protection scheme proposed by the Government, we are to provide not only for the protection of the workers in various industries, but also for that of the consumers, I say that  it  is far more necessary to regulate the local price of sugar than  it  is to regulate that of some of the implements in regard to which legislation has been suggested. I am  not asking that we should return to the ridiculous idea of endeavouring to control prices by Act of' Parliament.  . I  simply say that there is far more necessity to regulate the price of sugar in the home market than there is to regulate the price of some other commodities which will probably be dealt with under the scheme of new protection. In- 1905, under the adjustment of an Excise duty of£4 per ton, subject to  a  rebate upon sugar produced by white labour of <inline font-style="italic">£3 per</inline> ton, it was estimated that we should receive  a  net revenue from this commodity of , £560,000. But, like all our estimates in connexion with the sugar industry, it proved very wide of the mark. The net revenue anticipated during the present year - as I stated during the course of the Budget debate - will  be £241,000 - not £560,000, as was estimated in 1905. The Excise will amount to £746,000, and the import duty is expected to yield £68,000, or  a  total of , £814,000. From that sum <inline font-style="italic">we.</inline> have to deduct £573,000 for the bounty, and thus we arrive at the net result to. the States of , £241,000, as against  a  revenue of £780,000 in 1901-2. Seeing that, we are expending such  a  large sum of money in connexion with the sugar industry, we are entitled to know that the price charged for that commodity within our borders is  a  fair one, or, at all events, that we are not paying away this huge sum to enable people in other parts of the world to get cheap sugar' at our expense. I trust that the Government will make inquiries into this matter. </para>

Constant complaints have been made in reference to this matter. I am informed that some . proposal has been made to erect additions to the structure. If that be so, it might have been a good thing if the office had been entirely demolished by fire,- so as to compel the erection of a new building. I should like the Postmaster-General to consider whether it is worth while patching up this office, again. I understand that in connexion, with the additions contemplated, plans were prepared by the architect - I do not know whether this officer is under the control of the State or of the' Commonwealth. In his first plans' he did not provide for access to the postmaster's quarters, except through the window. Further, although he was in Cobar for a couple of days, I have been unable to ascertain that he ever inspected the building. If that sort of carelessness is to be exhibited in connexion with our public works, it is a strong argument in favour of . establishing a Commonwealth Public Works Department. Of course, I do not pretend to allocate the blame in connexion with this matter. But I would specially urge upon the Postmaster-General that it is questionable whether additions should be made to the present structure.- In my opinion, lt would be better to erect a new office. </para>
