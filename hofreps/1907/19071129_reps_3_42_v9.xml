                            <para>- Yes. The position, shortly, is that the High Court held that Federal officers' salaries were not liable to taxation by the States. That was held in Deakin's and Lyne's case. The matter was brought up again before one of the State Judges, who followed the decision of the High Court, but gave leave to appeal to the Privy Council. The Privy Council held that Federal incomes were liable to be assessed for purposes of taxation by the States. The matter arose again in Baxter's case before the High Court in Sydney, and in Flint's case in Melbourne. The High Court re-affirmed its decision, and refused a certificate for leave to appeal to the Privy Council. A petition was then filed with the Privy Council for leave to appeal by the State of New South Wales in Baxter's case, and, I understand, by the Government of Victoria in Flint and Crouch's case. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to ask a question of the Minister of Trade and Customs, and, in doing so, to make a short explanation. I understand that each day the only information, except the very ample reports - which are not official - of the press, given to merchants as to the duties fixed by  6812 <inline font-style="italic">Excise Procedure Bill</inline> [REPRESENTATIVES.] <inline font-style="italic">Personal Explanation.</inline> the Committee of Ways and Means is contained in a copy of the items dealt with posted at the Customs House. Some merchants have drawn my attention to the fact that, however desirous they are of preventing errors in their entries, they find it impossible, in the circumstances, to keep absolutely up to the Customs regulations.I, therefore, ask the Minister whether, as each division of the Tariff is dealt with, he. will cause the result to be published in a handy form, so that it may be circulated amongst merchants. I am told that would be a great convenience if it were done. </para>

                    <para>- I am sorry to have to trouble the House with a short personal explanation. A small newspaper, published in Melbourne, has made a statement to the effect that I have used my Ministerial influence to get leathers for hats, and machinery for hat-making, placed on the free list, and also to obtain a heavy duty upon hats and caps, and that the result means thousands of pounds to me personally. I should have taken no notice of the statement in the newspaper to which I refer, had not the lying statement been reprinted in quite a number of country papers in Victoria, and, as I learn now, in some New South Wales papers. I have to repeat what I said before, that neither in the case of material nor in. the case of manufactured goods in the hat-making, or any other industry have I a penny of interest, directly or indirectly. </para>

The recommendation of the A section of the Tariff Commission was that the duty should be 12 <inline font-style="italic">\</inline> per cent., but I desire to give a preference on this item, as the importations from foreign countries are much larger than from the United Kingdom. In 1906 the importations from the United Kingdom were represented by £134,848, out of a total of £340,435 ; and in the previous year by £132,522 out of a total of ,£340,5-35. This shows a large proportion as against Great Britain, and I desire, by my amendment, to give a preference in favour of the Old Country. I move - </para>

Not only so, but this duty is a fairly stiff tax on the States Governments, who are, of course, the largest importers and consumers of rails. This means a levy on the loan moneys, which, of course, come here from England in the form of goods. I remind the Committee that while we do not acknowledge that the States Governments, under the Constitution, are exempt from the payment of import duties, we take very great care that nothing imported by the Commonwealth shall be subject to any duty. Of course, this is a matter which affects the merits of the particular duty under consideration. I suggest that the Treasurer should allow rails to be admitted free.

                        <para>- The Treasurer wishes to increase the rate which he first proposed by 5 per cent., and this higher impost, according to his own figures, will affect two-thirds of the imports. I contend that the increased duty proposed will prove a very severe impost upon mines, and it will fall particularly heavy upon such semi-public bodies as the Adelaide Tramways Trust. The true policy would be to postpone the imposition of the duty, if one be desired, until we are assured that the local consumption can be met by local production. I understand that this is not the case at present, and is not likely to be for some years to come. </para>

                    <para>.- As the honorable member for Parramatta has pointed out, the fact should not be overlooked that it is proposed to grant a bounty upon the raw material from which the articles specified in this item are made until the iron industry has been sufficiently established. Perhaps the most important of these articles is rails, and it seems to me that they ought not to be subjected to a duty until the time arrives when the Government are satisfied that the iron industry has been established. </para>

                        <para>- But I am dealing with general principles, and I think it would be wise to discuss this matter 6816 <inline font-style="italic">Tariff</inline> [REPRESENTATIVES.](Rails, <inline font-style="italic">&amp;c.).</inline> without reference to any particular person. I desire to assist the Treasurer in disposing speedily of the remaining items in this division. All that he desires is that the manufacture of steel rails shall be established in Australia. We all desire that, and nobody wishes it more strongly than I do. But the way in which the Government propose to encourage the industry is by offering a substantial bounty upon the production of iron until it has been established, and subsequently by extending to it a substantial protective duty. I think that the same line of reasoning is applicable to a good many things other' than steel rails, but I confine my remarks to rails because they seem to me of most importance. It has been pointed out that it may be decided that State imports, under this heading, are not subject to duty. If that view should be upheld it is apparent that the duties which we impose upon steel rails will be a considerable tax upon those who have contracted to construct private railways and tramways, and that at a time when admittedly the industry is not capable of manufacturing them. As soon as the Ministry are prepared to come to the House and say, " <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandford</inline> is in a position to manufacture these rails and the industry has been established; let us extend to him a protective duty," I shall be prepared to support their proposal. But until then I think it would be a serious thing to impose this duty on rails. It will be a purely revenue duty for the time being, and will probably be collected only upon the small quantity of rails which is imported by private enterprise. I ask the Treasurer to consider whether it would not be wise at this stage to omit the word "rails" from this item with a view to its insertion in division VIb. </para>

What I want to do is to get rid of this item, if possible, in order to enable those honorable- members who wish to go away to-night to catch the trains. I have informed the  deputy  leader of the Opposition that if he will mention two or three items which they wish to have dealt with before they go away, I will take those items out of their turn so that those items which are not contentious in any way may be dealt with afterwards, if necessary. I am willing to do that with a view to conveniencing honorable members, and enabling them to get away by the trains if they wish to go to-night. </para>

                    <para>. - I suggest to the Treasurer that rails generally will be the subject of consideration under Division  VIa.,  and under the bounty provisions. And with regard to the larger form of rail, which is used by railway companies, as well as by State Governments, it does seem to me that we are giving unnecessary assistance if we impose a duty under this division, and then give a bounty under another proposal which the Government have in hand. </para>

                        <para>- To my regret the House has agreed to the bounty provision. I think it is unwise to propose so much bounty, and so much duty, at the same time. I suggest either that rails should be eliminated, or that the duties should be confined tb the smaller description of rails. </para>

                        <para>- I must have missed the eloquence of the honorable member. I do not remember any such incident. Therefore I must nave been out of the chamber at the time. What I want to do is to limit the weight of the rail on which duty is to be charged. That will achieve practically the same object. A large number of small iron rails are now manufactured locally, and I do not see why they should not receive some degree of protection. </para>

                <para>Supplies for Australia come principally from America and Germany in addition to those from Great Britain. Preference should undoubtedly be given in favour of British goods for these reasons. Supplies come through the resident representative in Sydney of the United Slates Steel Trust, the biggest trust in the world. If business in American rails is to be allowed, then let the business be done through Australian merchants, who are now completely shut out by reason of the presence of this trust in the country. During the last two or three years a war of freights between America and Australia has resulted in supplies coming from America at as low a freight as 7s. 6d. per ton as against 25s. to 30s. per ton from England. Almost the same remarks apply as to Germany, with this difference that the  lower  wages in Germany, should not be lost sight of. Australian politicians claim as the basic reason of protection against British-made goods that the highly paid Australian workman must be protected against the lower paid British workman. This principle, therefore, should be carried out to . a logical conclusion by a preference or protection for the British steam-ship owners against the heavily-subsidized German steamers, and for the higher price of labour in the United Kingdom than in Germany. </para>
                <para>In New Zealand a preference of 20 per cent, is given in favour of British rails. Previous to that being given, the. rails imported into New Zealand came almost entirely from Germany and the United States. Since then they have come from Great Britain.. I would ask the honorable member for South Sydney, in particular, to support a preference to Great Britain, as otherwise it seems to be a foregone conclusion that a great proportion of the rails will come from Germany and America. </para>

I desire to ask you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> whether I should be in order in moving an amendment now, or later on. in connexion with steel sleepers imported as tramway material. At the present time steel sleepers are separated from the rest of tramway material. They come in as metals n.e.i. I propose to move an amendment so as to make steel sleepers come in on. the same basis as steel rails and other tramway  material. Suppose, for instance, that I wanted to let a contract for a tramway in a mine. It would be very awkward if the sleepers came in under one heading of the Tariff and the rails and the rest of the equipment under another heading. I understand from the departmental officers that they have no objection whatever to what I propose, if the Minister is agreeable. </para>

                    <para>- - It seems to me that this will be a severe impost upon private tramways and railways whether for public convenience or for mining purposes. It is only in such cases that it will actually be felt. If we remove steel rails from the item we shall have left materials used largely by the States Governments, who will have returned to them a very large proportion of the revenue collected in respect of the duty. In this way local manufacturers will be disadvantaged rather than benefited, inasmuch as the States Governments in calling for tenders for the supply of material of this kind -will take into consideration the fact that if they accept a foreign tender they will secure a good deal of revenue from the duty. I do not think that the item is worth the time that the Treasurer has devoted to it. If he is prepared to agree to duties of 15 per cent and 10 per cent. I shall have nothing more to say. </para>

                    <para>.- It appears to me that since steel rails have not yet been made in Australia, the only effect of the duty, if the item be passed in the form proposed by the Treasurer, will be to raise revenue. There is, of course, the further consideration that steel rails may be made in a New South Wales foundry. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member for South Sydney said that he objects to a duty being imposed on this item, because we have already agreed to the second reading of the Manufactures  Encouragement  Bill, under which a bounty is to be given on the production of iron and steel. In reply to that contention I would point out that under another measure we have granted bounties on the production of coffee, tobacco, tobacco leaf, fish, dried fruits, and other things, and that in spite of the representations of some honorable members of the Opposition duties have been imposed upon those commodities. The honorable member for South Sydney himself voted for some of those duties which, in proportion to the value of the goods to which they relate, are much heavier than are these. I have never objected unless on the grounds- of fair play to vote against protective duties affecting industries in even my own State, but many other honorable members have invariably voted for high duties on goods and have done so regardless of whether or not they were the subject of bounty. I ha.ve said on several occasions that, in the absence of good reasons to the contrary, I would accept the old duties, and I have- not endeavoured to reduce them. I have recognised that where an industry has risen with that assistance, and has since been working under the old duties it would be to some degree unjust to those engaged in it if the duties were so soon removed. Whilst, personally, I should be quite willing under ordinary circumstances to agree to rails being admitted free, I am faced with the situation that just as the iron industry, which has been working under 'great difficulties, is about to produce steel rails, it is proposed, by the very honorable members who have supported much higher duties on imports  affecting  other industries,  that it shall be treated differently from every other industry. I am not inclined to fall into that trap, more particularly as we have accepted as a compromise much higher duties on, other iron manufactures than are those now under consideration. This particular article is produced in one State, and apparently a different treatment is to be given to it than is meted out to industries in another State. I do not think that is right. I agree with the position taken up by the honorable member for South Sydney, that where a bounty has been given there should not be duties. If the honorable member had carried out that principle his position would be perfectly sound. But he has not done so. He has voted for duties on articles in connexion with which we are not merely considering, but have actually passed a measure granting bounties. I am quite willing that there should be an adjustment providing for the imposition of duties of 15 per cent, under the general Tariff and 10 per cent, on imports from the United Kingdom. That would represent an average of 12^ per cent. , which was the duty imposed under the old Tariff. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that this is an item in' connexion with which a preference should be provided. I have submitted the item, and we have had a proposition to leave out rails, which I absolutely object to. Then a proposal was made to make the  duty  10 per cent., which would be lower than the recommendation of the Tariff Commission and lower than the old duty. In the circumstances I would very much rather agree to a duty of 12J per cent, all round, which is the duty that was imposed under the old Tariff. If honorable members are prepared to accept that I shall not press the Government proposal any longer. I do not wish to detain the Committee, but I should like to know at once whether a majority of honorable members are inclined to accept the suggestion that the duty should be 121 per cent, all round and let the matter  drop. </para>

                    <para>-431-- There is some misapprehension as to what is included in this item. Some honorable members appear to think that steel rails are not included. I remind the Committee of the importance of steel rails to Australia. We have in the whole of the Commonwealth less than 15,000 miles of railway. In Victoria alone there are 3,342 miles of railway, and if the mileage laid down' in the other States were in proportion we should have in Australia 113,000 miles of railway. It is ali very well for Victorian members to propose to tax steel rails which have to be laid in the other States. </para>

                        <para>- But they have paid no duty to Western Australia to be allowed to lay them. We are being asked under this item to contribute to the revenue of the Commonwealth before we can lay a mile of railway. We can only afford in Western Australia to build railways out of loan money, and honorable members would appear not to mind our borrowing money and handing it over to the Commonwealth to spend on the richest States, which last year had huge surpluses of revenue. Queensland has 3,114 miles of railway; Western Australia, with an area one-third larger than Queensland, has only 2,312 miles, including 700 miles of private lines. New Zealand has 2,520 miles of railways, and the United States, with an area considerably less than that of Australia, has 217,000 miles of railways. We have heard a good deal of talk in this House about the necessity 'of opening up the country, but taxing the construction of railways is not likely to bring that about. People have been walking about Australia long enough, while the members of various Parliaments have been talking about what they were going to do to open up the interior. We have an opportunity here to do .something practical by allowing steel rails to be imported free. We cannot open up a country with cheap whisky, yet 2s. a gallon has been taken off whisky in Western Australia, whilst a proposal is made to increase the duty on steel rails. If I wished to prevent the opening up of a country, I would give people cheap whisky, and I guarantee, many would not get far into the interior. They would be kept down near the coast. The policy .of the present Government would appear to be dear rails and cheap whisky. There is no sense in it. If. we. could make steel rails in Australia I would say that we ought to do so. I should be prepared to vote for the highest bounty necessary to secure the manufacture of rails in Australia, but I am not prepared to vote for a high duty on rails when they are not made here. In Western Australia the Government are borrowing .money to build railways, whilst the Commonwealth Government are retaining 25 per cent, of the duties collected from Customs and Excise. </para>

Natal is but a little country, comprising not more than one-eightieth of the area of Australia. Yet, in proportion, Natal has eighteen times our length of railways per square mile. The area of Australia is ten times that of Cape Colony, and yet that country  has in proportion four times our length of railways. Japan, a country that we have to fear in the future, is another instance. If we had railways in the same proportion as Japan has, we should have a million miles of them. Japan on an area of 13,000 square miles has 5,000 miles of railway. </para>

The United States of America have 20,000,000 tons of rails laid down more than we have. They have paid no tax or duty on them to any other country. Let us make the rails here. I will help the Government to give a bounty to encourage their manufacture, but I shall not vote for a duty on them. We must open up Australia, and must have rails to do it. Look at the huge Northern Territory, and the immense areas of land between here and there. Those honorable members who paid a visit to the Territory recently went by water. Think of the senselessness of people who, instead of laying rails to open up a country, travel round the edge of it by sea. Within the last six weeks, I saw train loads of cattle which had come down from the Cooper Creek country. They had been brought <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Oodnadatta to Adelaide, and then across to Melbourne to feed the Melbourne people. Why should we not have rails laid to those splendid areas of country? There is not a rail laid there to-day. </para>

                        <para>- How could people live there if we forbid the laying of rails? People will go wherever the railways go. Open up the country, and people will follow. They could not possibly live in that country without rails. In the interests of settlement, people should be given facilities for 'travelling about the country, and for sending their produce to market. They must have rails for those purposes. This country is a finer one than people recognise. There is not a railway that has ever been built in Australia but has developed country which has turned out a credit to the people who authorized the building of the line. I know of many railways which it was said would ruin the State when they were built, and yet every one of them has helped hundreds and" thousands of people to settle on the land, and so turn the interior of Australia to proper use. In America, where there are so many fine rivers, the water is used for irrigating, and rails are laid alongside the rivers to carry the produce. The policy of America from the start has been cheap rails and cheap carriage. We must recognise that we can hold Australia only by developing it with railways. We shall never hold it against, the great Eastern powers if we are to tax railway construction. It is disgraceful for any man who pretends to legislate for the benefit of Australia to vote for one penny of duty on steel rails. We should do our best to devise some means by which we can make rails in Australia. That would be sensible. But we must within the next twenty years lay in Australia at least another 15,000 or 20,000 miles of rails. I ask the Committee to support the amendment of the honorable member for South Sydney, to place steel rails on the free list. </para>

I am afraid that developments have occurred which seem to indicate the .possibility that that will not be done. I cannot understand the attitude of the Committee in being prepared to vote for a revenue or protective duty upon a commodity, of which the Minister himself admits that not a single pound has been produced in Australia yet, especially when we are assured that there is to be a bounty to encourage its manufacture. I am prepared to support that bounty, but, apparently, a number of honorable members are ready to sneak a duty on to the article in addition. </para>

I have certainly not intentionally voted for a duty when we are paying a bounty. We ought to adopt the suggestion of the honorable member for South Sydney, and make rails subject to duty by proclamation, so as not to penalize users of rails that are not made in Australia.

                            <para>- As I did not vote for a bounty on iron, I am now taking a consistent course. A duty of 12½ per cent. has been in operation for the last six years. In discussing this question, I am bound to mention <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandford,</inline> since he owns the only large iron-works in Australia; and I point out, that now he is about to manufacture steel rails, it is suggested that he should be deprived of the benefit of this revenue duty of 12½ per cent. I understand that the <inline font-style="italic">, £70,000</inline> he received from the New South Wales Government was , to enable him to erect mills for the special purpose of making rails. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandford</inline> rolled steel rails at Eskbank  nearly twenty years ago for the State Government. I may explain. . however, that he simply rolled old rails after they had been cut up and melted ; in other words, he made steel rails from scrap. That work was put an end to when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Eddy</inline> became railway commissioner in New South Wales. That gentleman at once introduced larger engines, which instead of 60-lb. rails, which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandford</inline> used to roll, required 85-lb. rails. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandford,</inline> I may say, was given compensation by the State Government for the termination of his contract. </para>

                                told the Tariff Commission that he did not desire a bounty, and he gave the reason. He had to give an undertaking to the State Government, under the arrangement I have mentioned, that any bounty must be handed over to the Government ; and, under the circumstances, he naturally prefers a small duty of 12½ per cent.

                                made a bargain which has resulted in the erection of the first blast furnace in Australia. I am inclined to think, however, that it was not a good bargain for himself ; and, if that be the case, there is no reason why we should further penalize him.

                        <para>.- I was under the impression that the debate upon this item would not occupy more than a few minutes, and why so much heat has been imported into it, I cannot understand. For the past six years a duty of 12½ per cent. has been, levied upon iron, and we have also determined that it is necessary to grant a bounty upon the production of that commodity in order to encourage the establishment of the iron industry. Yet it is now proposed that the duty shall be remitted. It is like giving a man a pound with one hand and taking 25s. away from him with the other. If we wish the iron industry to prosper we ought not to abolish the duty upon rails. I trust that the old rate will be retained. </para>

                        <para>. - The Committee is apparently of opinion that it is of the first importance that the iron industry should be established in the Commonwealth. But notwithstanding that the Manufactures Encouragement Bill has passed its second reading it has a perilous time in front of it. I think it is dawning upon the minds of several honorable members that if we desire to assist the establishment of the iron industry we ought to view this question from the stand-point of whether or not the operation of a duty will have that effect. I think that the policy of the Labour Party will be to prevent the Manufactures Encouragement Bill from passing. </para>

                            <para>- I think that a majority of the party are opposed to the Bill. Personally, I favour the imposition of a reasonable duty upon rails, altogether apart from the fact that we have already committed ourselves to the general principle embodied in the Manufactures Encouragement Bill, the passing of which is, however, exceedingly doubtful. I am satisfied that honorable members do not desire that a bounty and a protective duty shall be simultaneously operative. </para>

                        <para>.- If we wish to develop the iron industry in the Commonwealth, we should develop it in the way the House has agreed to, namely, by means of a bounty. We ought in this matter to adopt a straightforward course, and ought not to consider the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandford</inline> has concluded, an arrangement with the New South Wales Government under which any bounty that he may receive will be paid into the State Treasury. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot see why we should retard the progress of Australia by placing a duty upon an article which is absolutely necessary to its development. Steel rails are not made here, and we desire to encourage their production by the granting of a bounty. Why we should be asked to tax all the States Governments and others by imposing a revenue duty upon steel rails is beyond my comprehension. The time has arrived when we should endeavour to establish the industry in a straightforward way, namely, by means of the granting of a bounty. If we adopt that course, we shall not injure any of the States, or any of those persons who are engaged in railway enterprise. On the other hand, if we levy a tax upon rails, we shall inevitably retard the progress of the whole Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>.- The honorable member for Swan has said that there is nothing like a straightforward course. I also believe in a straightforward course, and I voted for a bounty as the least objectionable method of assisting to develop the iron industry of Australia. I have voted for a bounty system which will apply not only to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandford,</inline> but to any other maker of iron who may put in a claim. It was not passed in the interests of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandford</inline> only, but in the interests of Australian manufacturers, and it extends to the production of steel rails. It may be that a friend of the right honorable gentleman in Western Australia will claim the bounty. I certainly agree with the right honorable gentleman that the imposition of a revenue duty on an article when we are unable to produce it is not only absurd, but also a tax upon the community generally. The chief users of 6826 <inline font-style="italic">Tariff</inline> [REPRESENTATIVES.](Rails, <inline font-style="italic">&amp;c.).</inline> steel rails in Australia are the States Governments. They practically use the bulk of the imported rails in the construction of railways, which are designed for the development of their territories. If we impose a duty of a revenue character, we shall get no compensating advantage in the way of assisting the iron industry, but we shall compel every person in each State to carry a burden which will tend to retard the process of developing its resources. Because, after all, there is a limit to the borrowing capacity of each State, and to the amount which it can afford to expend on railway construction. Every tax of a needless character which we impose is a tax upon the States. The honorable member for Swan prefaced his remarks with the statement that he likes a straightforward policy. So do I. I am sorry that the right honorable gentleman was a member of the Ministry which imposed a duty of  12½  per cent. on steel rails in the old Tariff. That duty, which is certainly not consistent with a straightforward policy, was imposed upon Australia by the Barton Administration, in which the right honorable gentleman took a prominent part. </para>

                            <para>- I may tell the right honorable gentleman that the party in which I am a prominent member is very solid.. Every morning we have our caucus in the train, and the great trouble is that invariably the party make me their spokesman ; but we do not quarrel either here or outside. I think that the straightforward policy to which the right honorable gentleman has professed to be so much attached is rather belated. I wish that it had been practised in the time of the Barton Administration. </para>

                            <para>- They are not the only things changed. The right honorable gentleman has changed his supporters since then. I remember the time when he was very much attached to the Labour Party, but he will not have their support now. I suggest to the Treasurer that if he is prepared to accept a duty of12½ per cent., as I am told he is, he may as well climb down to the dead level. If he is prepared to accept a duty of  12½  per cent. he cannot justify it as a protectionist duty. </para>

                        <para>- I recognised that those who were induced to start industries under the old duties had some claim for the continuance of those duties, at any rate for a time. I have often voted what I call protectionist duties, partly because, in some cases, I could not get less - that is where I did not think that there was any claim - and partly because in other cases I thought that there was a just claim owing to the. encouragement which had been deliberately given by our policy. Throughout the Tariff I have been acting on that principle, and with regard to industries everywhere. I have opposed, and shall continue to oppose, a bounty upon the production of iron. The bounty would give assistance to the makers of some articles which are now free. Although those articles are duty free, yet I shall oppose the bounty, and give no assistance which has not been already given. </para>

                            <para>- There should be no duplication. If a bounty is carried, then the duty ought to be remitted, or we should put in a provision that it shall be deducted from the bounty. When I am asked to vote differently in the case of this industry, and to give no recognition to a duty which has been in existence, I am asked to do an injustice which I have not attempted to do in the case of other manufacturers. I do not think that I am inconsistent in the least degree. I believe that, as a rule, honorable members know how I intend to vote on a Tariff question before I have voted. Therefore I think that the honorable member for Swan is quite wrong in his statement. I shall not reproach him with having supported the imposition of a higher duty when he was a member of the Barton Government. </para>

                        <para>.- I intend to vote for the continuance of the old duty. Under the proposal accepted  6828 <inline font-style="italic">Tariff</inline> [REPRESENTATIVES.](Rails,&amp;c.). by the Treasurer there will be no change. I cannot understand why it is that some protectionists intend to vote to wipe out the duty on steel rails. A great deal has been said about the granting of the bounty. Presuming that the Manufactures Encouragement Bill gets into Committee, and becomes law, it will merely involve the payment of the bounty on the production of pig iron, and steel made from it. But what about the manufacture of rails from the raw material? Surely the manufacture of steel rails from the simple steel is in itself an industry as much entitled to a duty as any other commodity included in the Tariff. So far as the amount of the bounty proposed to be paid is concerned, I must say that I am not very much impressed by its value. The amount proposed to be paid is very small if we really desire to establish a great industry. The probability is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandford</inline> under present conditions will be able to obtain the whole bounty paid. The capacity of his blast furnaces enables him to turn out about 50,000 tons per annum, and his resources in reference to the two processes through which steel has to go, would enable him to obtain the whole amount. Even if he were to do that, however, he would be able to produce only about one-eighth or one- tenth of the total requirements of Australia. So that the bounty proposed to be granted for the development of the iron industry is a mere infinitesimal proportion. I shall vote for the continuance of the duty of 12½ per cent. on steel rails, because I consider that it is a branch of industry the claims of which for a measure of protection are as great as are those of any other item in the Tariff. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly the industry is not one of much importance. The manufacture of barbed wire involves merely the importing of wire, and with a machine twisting in the barb. There are not many person's engaged in the industry, whilst the wire-netting industry provides employment for comparatively a great many hands. </para>

                            <para>- Barbed wire and wire-netting are used practically by the same people, and both for fences, and yet an increased duty is proposed on barbed wire. I think that a duty of  10  per cent. would be sufficient, and it is really too much when compared with the duty on wire-netting. I should like to know if the Treasurer is prepared to accept  10  per cent. ? I am willing to agree to duties of  15  per cent. and  10  per cent. </para>

                        <para>.- Some honorable members who are away would probably take a very different view of this proposal. There has been no intimation that these articles were to be transferred to a more highly dutiable item. It is a dangerous practice to make that proposal on a Friday afternoon, when a number of honorable members have gone away.  I  have seen nothing published to indicate that the Treasurer intended to take this step. </para>

The free-trade section, on some principle of their own, recommended a 10 per cent, duty. The articles were free previously. The Government should give some very good reasons for proposing to increase the duty so greatly. </para>

Therefore we must either accept the item as it stands, with a duty of 5 per cent, and free, by affirming that the item shall stand as printed, or else, if we negative the item, we will leave it to the sweet will of the Treasurer to include the articles in any other item he likes. In those circumstances, it will be difficult for any honorable member to move for duties of 15 per cent, and 10 per cent. </para>

                        <para>.- Some days ago I asked the Treasurer to postpone this item because I was aware that a large quantity of wire gauze and wire cloth was being manufactured in Australia. The Treasurer himself is now in possession of several samples.
