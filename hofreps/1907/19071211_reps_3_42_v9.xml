                        <para>- The honorable member will recollect that the comment made by the learned Judge - which I, of course, do not criticise in any way - was made in dealing with an application from the Government, while giving reasons why, in his opinion, it could not be complied with. The endeavour of the Government was to secure, as far as possible, a uniform standard, in view of the fact that the decision of the previous Judge of the Arbitration Court had established one standard of wages in South Australia, which, in some respects, differed from his own decision. The learned Judge's comment on our application was that the Government had not been represented on the previous application, with which he had dealt. That is perfectly true, but the Government was not represented at the application on which his predecessor fixed the rate of wages for South Australia, and there was no suggestion at the time that it required to be represented. Of course, the question which my honorable and learned colleague had then to consider was whether, in view of the judgment by the first  President  of the Arbitration Court, anything had been discovered showing that it was necessary for the Government to intervene. There seemed to be nothing of that kind, nothing in that first judgment. But a new state of affairs was created by the judgment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins, which, in the opinion of my honorable and. learned colleague, made it necessary for the Government .to intervene. I assume that the learned Judge did not consider it within his province, or at all events, within his duty, to comment upon the changed state of affairs following upon his own judgment. </para>

                            <para>- If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> will permit me, I will say, in reply to the inquiry, that the obvious difficulty suggested is one of the chief of those which it is the hope of the Government to meet by fresh proposals. We also realize that so long as the proceedings of Law Courts are conducted in the formal protracted and expensive manner which is required for most of their purposes, their proceedings when they come to deal with matters industrial, some of them relatively small, but all requiring to be treated by the same ponderous machinery, may create a serious situation. Consequently, the proposals of the Government, which probably .will be laid upon the table before we rise to-day - my honorable and learned colleague' has just informed me that the final revise is expected within half-an-hour or an hour - will show that it is in order to meet that difficulty 6y other substantive and substituted proposals that the Government is foreshadowing legislation in the near future. </para>

                            <para>- I have already indicated that the Government think that Bill ought to be dealt with by the House before the Christmas adjournment. Of course, we recognise that legal objections may be taken, but we think that they should offer no obstacle, inasmuch as the House cannot finally determine legal questions, especially when there is a conflict of professional opinion. </para>

                            <para>- The instructions to counsel authorized him to ask the Judge to secure uniformity in the rates of wages so far as was practicable, having regard, of course, to differences in the place in which the manufacture occurred, or to any other circumstances. Of course, every one desires uniformity as far as possible, and that is what counsel was instructed to ask for. I have no doubt that the newspapers take special care in reporting the utterances of a Judge, but: when they are summarizing or condensing the arguments of counsel necessarily take much more liberty. </para>

I find it rather difficult to understand how a difference of opinion between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> O'Connor and ' <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins as to the rate of wages creates a ground of justifiable intervention by the Government, which did not exist when the application was made in Adelaide. I beg to ask the honorable gentleman whether he proposes to take the latest deci- . sion in each case, as the standard of uniformity, irrespective of the fact that it may be lower or perhaps higher than "one previously prescribed? </para>

                        <para>- I am in a difficulty even greater than that of my honorable and learned friend in perceiving what the first statement he made has to do with the question with which he concluded. However, that is immaterial. All I have to say is that, as he is aware, under similar circumstances a later judgment would be reckoned of somewhat more value, even in the same Court, and by the same Judge, than a previous one. Inasmuch as it is not the decision of a higher Court, nor the decision of a numerically stronger Court, the judgment stands. </para>

That being so, how did the Government expect to be afforded an opportunity to obtain any rule of uniformity that would be obligatory ? </para>

I observe intoday's newspapers that it is stated that the Minister is going to take vigorous action at the end of the week in connexion with the harvester Excise.

I have made inquiries, and I find that the statements made with regard to the Commandant were not quite correct. The Commandant was sympathetic, but it was a. matter of money. He had no power to grant what was desired. lt being a matter of money, I brought it under the attention of the Treasurer, and he, seeing that what was desired was a national step in the right direction, and that the amount involved was a small one - only about <inline font-style="italic">£50</inline> - immediately said that the money would be forthcoming. </para>

                        <para>- I desire to ask the Minister of Trade and Customs a question without notice. In view of the statements contained in this morning's newspapers, to the effect that the remainder of the Tariff is to be put through in one sitting, I should like to know when he will be in a position to inform the House" with regard to matters relating to stripper harvesters, namely, the number of imports, the number of exports, and the number of harvester strippers made during the current year? I should also like to know whether that information will be made available before th.e item to which it relates is dealt with? </para>

Legal proceedings will be taken against those who are not disposed to carry out the regulations which have been made, and instructions have been given, to the Crown Solicitor to proceed against them. That is all that the Government could do. The delay has not been caused by any fault of ours. Not one day has been lost. Notices have been issued from day to day. But it was impossible to date the fourteen days - the period allowed to the manufacturers - from the day the notices were sent out. They had to be sent to many distant places. The time allowed will, in all cases, have expired on Monday, and then legal proceedings will be taken forthwith. </para>

When statements are made in a newspaper, such as the one to which the honorable member refers, we -are bound to take notice of them.

It is, of course, impossible to prevent the Standard Oil Company from raising their price if they like. </para>

                            <para>- Unfortunately, this case is different from others, because there is no competition. I understand that the honorable member for. Maranoa and others complain that when the Tariff was introduced those who already had in stock large quantities of Kerosene in tins immediately raised the price, although they were not called upon to pay any duty. We are asked whether we  cp"not  take steps to cause a refund of the increased amount so paid. I wish we could. If there were such a means we should avail ourselves of it. </para>

I wrote a private letter on the subject to one qf the State Ministers, and I asked the Prime Minister to write to the head of the State Government asking him not to agree to anything of the kind, and to carry out the arrangement made in the first instance by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Danysz</inline> not to attempt experiments on the mainland without the concurrence of the Federal Government. That letter was despatched a day or two ago to the head of the Government of New South Wales, and I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade</inline> will give every consideration to such a request from the Prime Minister. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to say shortly in submitting this item that, as a protectionist, in common with the other members of the Ministry, I prefer to protect the manufacturers of pianos in Australia rather than to encourage the large importation of these instruments which takes place from other countries in the world. According to a statement supplied to me, the value of these instruments imported in 1906 was: - From the United Kingdom , £24,856 ; Canada, <inline font-style="italic">£2,265;</inline> France, £180 ; Germany, £205,080; and from the. United States, £9,246; or a total value of £241,357. I hold that it is very much better in the interests of our country that that money, or a large portion of it, should be spent in Australia than that it should be sent in the way it was to the countries named. I have some price lists here giving the prices of pianos, f.o.b. at the port of export. I am not sufficiently acquainted with the business to describe the pianos catalogued in each case, but I find these values given in one catalogue of imports - , £14 7s. 6d., £14 17s. 6d., £15 7s., £17 us., £17 19s.,, ; £18 8s., . £19, and £21 9s. According to another catalogue, these values, f.o.b. at the port of export, are given for another list of pianos- £13 6s., . £14 5s., two more at <inline font-style="italic">£13</inline> 6s.. three at £15 4s., others at <inline font-style="italic">£172s., £2018s.</inline> , £181s., £6 13s.- that is an organ - <inline font-style="italic">£7</inline> 12s., and so on. In another catalogue the prices are £15 2s. 6d., £17 is., £21 19s., £1711s., , £18 5s. 6d., and , £20 14s. 6d. . In still another catalogue the price for a piano is <inline font-style="italic">£9</inline> 17s. 6d., f.o.b. packing 2s. 6d. extra. </para>

                        <para>- I think the honorable member is absolutely wrong. But in piano-making, our timber, fine as it is, cannot be used until sufficient time has been allowed for it to season. I have suggested to the Prime Minister and my colleagues the desirability of obtaining, in every State, a large quantity of our best woods, and having them properly seasoned under Government supervision before they are used. </para>

                    <para>.- We are out for business this morning, with a desire to get through the Tariff as quickly as possible. I am not here to make any appeals for or against . either local manufacturers or importers : but I desire, in as few words as possible, to place the position before the Treasurer and the Committee. Time after time we have decided against fixed duties, and I hope we shall strike out the fixed duty in the present instance. </para>

                        <para>- Personally, I am against fixed duties, but I have no desire to debate the question, beyond saying that the same arguments which apply to other items apply to pianos. I suppose that every honorable member has had supplied to him about enough ammunition, in the shape of information, to last him over a debate for six months ; but I hope that that information will not be read out time after time on either one side or the other. If there is a single item which has been well looked after by both importers, agents, and manufacturers, it is that of pianos. I confess that I am now occupied merely as a range-finder, with an effort' to have an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty only. I frankly admit that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale's</inline> factory is in my electorate; and it is a factory of which we mav be proud. We have been told that in this factory there are employed 400 operatives ; and I may here say that I have not been approached by a single worker asking me to assist in the imposition of a higher duty, or indeed, any duty ; in fact, not a single artisan in ray electorate has approached me on behalf of any industry. This shows that, mine is an electorate of robust industries, and that my constituents know their representative well. On the other hand, old friends and school-mates of mine, who are my supporters, and are in the importing line of business, have approached me both by letter and telegram. But these representations have no weight with me - I act on my own responsibility. The manufacturer himself has also approached me ; but I have never stated, outside this House, the conclusion at which I have arrived in regard to this duty, because, in my opinion, (hat decision ought to be arrived at within this Chamber. I have not been asked by a single member how I proposed to vote, and I think- it will be admitted that I have never bothered honor-, able members as to how they are going to vote. My own judgment is that pianos will bear neither a 40 per cent, duty nor a 20 per cent. duty, but will bear duties of 30 per cent, and 25 per cent. That will represent an increase of only 5per cent, upon the rate levied under" the old Tariff in the case of imports from the United Kingdom. </para>

                        <para>- It does not matter what they recommended. So far an increase in the old rates of duty has been sanctioned in respect of almost every item . in this Tariff. Last night, I found free-trade members moving for the imposition of a duty of 30 per cent, upon vehicles. </para>

                        <para>- I shall deal with that aspect of the matter presently. So far as grand and semi-grand pianos are concerned, an increase of10 per cent, under the General Tariff, and of  5  per cent, under the Tariff for Great Britain, would be a small matter. On a piano costing  £200  or  £300  an additional  5  per cent.' is scarcely worth considering. ' After leading the evidence given before the Tariff Commission,I think that both the importers of pianos and the Australian manufacturer have "a good thing on." I would rather be a semi-grand in Beale's factory than a grand in this Parliament. I do not suggest that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> is a philanthropist. </para>

                        <para>- I should like to see a duty of  35  per cent, imposed upon grand pianos, but  25  per cent, represents my high-water mark as against British productions. Having perused all the evidence, and the statements which have been made in connexion with this matter, I have come to the conclusion that both the importers of pianos and the local manufacturer have a good thing on, and that the users get very little out of either. I admit, however, that piano-making is a good, clean industry, and that the employes of the local manufacturer are well treated. I should not know one of them if I met him in the street, and none of them has approached me, while, so far as the proprietor of the business which has been referred to is concerned, I have stated publicly what I have said to him privately. But as the woollen and other industries are to be protected by duties of  30  per cent, and  45  per cent., it is not too much to give the local manufacturer of pianos a,n increase of  5  per cent. </para>

But I do not put up the umbrella because of the existence of some industry in my electorate. i have voted for protective duties solely because I thought that they would benefit the workers as well as the manufacturers. I have had no regard to my personal interests, and have given no consideration to the effect of my votes upon the support I can look for from my constituents. The honorable member for Dalley five years ago spoke very differently in regard to the piano duty, although <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale's</inline> piano factory was then established in his electorate. Although he is the same Billy Wilks, his tone to-day is quite different from that which he employed on the previous occasion. </para>

                <para>Although in 1902 the honorable member for Dalley regarded 15 per cent, as a high protective duty, he now asks for a duty of 35 on cent., notwithstanding that we have it on the authority of an honorable member that the balance-sheets of the last two or three years show that enormous profits are being made by the local manufacturer, and that his business is increasing by leaps and bounds. Is the honorable member for Dalley going to give this gentleman another 20 per cent, bonus? </para>

At the termination of that speech the honorable member said that in view of the enlarged market a duty of 15, per cent, was ample, if not more than ample, protection for the industry.' I desire now to make a few remarks on what the Treasurer has said with regard to this question. I do not think that the document which he read to the Committee was a fair one. In order to create sympathy with the Australian industry as against the foreigner, he led us to suppose that all the importers of pianos bore foreign names. </para>

                        <para>- That is the position in regard to that matter. When I was speaking on the item of wool-scouring machines the honorable member for  Dalley  told me that a workman in the western districts .of Queensland and New South Wales did not cart a  wool-scouring  machine about in his pocket, nor have one in his home merely for the fun of the thing. I say the same thing with regard to pianos. My constituents do not carry them about in their swags when " pushing the knot" or " waltzing Matilda." The only instruments they have are mouth organs or accordions, which give them all the music they want and are not '.heavy to carry. But -honorable members should think of the people who do want to buy pianos as well as of those who manufacture them. Suppose there are 500 men employed 'in this industry. Are" we going to tax the balance of the  4,000,000  people of this country to keep 500 men employed? But that is the doctrine which we have heard from the honorable member for Dalley. It is not the doctrine which we have been accustomed to hear from him. I cannot for the life of me understand on what principle he can agree to jump from duties of 15 to 35 per cent., when we know that the lower rate is more than ample for the industry. </para>

                        <para>- I will not pursue the matter. I intend to propose a reduction in duty on pianos below that proposed by the honorable member for Dalley. At the conclusion of my speech, I shall move to reduce the duties to  25  and  20  per cent. As to the argument of the honorable member for Dalley that because the Committee has increased duties in connexion with other industries, we ought not to refuse to increase the duties on pianos, I can only say that if he has no stronger argument to bring forward than that, he has a very weak case. Are we to understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale's</inline> industry is in such a parlous condition that unless he receives increased protection he  will  have to close up? It is a fair question to ask why <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> did not appear before the Tariff Commission, and ask for increased duties? The fact that he did not do so is a sufficient justification for refusing to increase them. Was he afraid of the facts which would be disclosed as the  result  of cross-examination ? He did not even give the protectionist section of the Commission a chance of advocating higher duties, presumably because he was unwilling to disclose the profitable nature of his business, as it would have been disclosed in cross-examination. </para>

                        <para>- I have not put it forward as anything but an assumption, but it is a reasonable assumption. A Tariff Commission was specially appointed to investigate such matters. An opportunity was afforded to manufacturers of airing their grievances, and showing why duties should be increased. It was an impartially constituted Commission, composed equally of protectionists and free-traders for the purpose of sifting the facts relating to all industries that were alleged to be suffering as a result of insufficient protection. The Commission was appointed with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale's</inline> full knowledge. He knew that it was sitting, and inviting manufacturers to give evidence. He was well aware that half the members of the Commission were more than sympathetically disposed to those manufacturers who had a grievance. He knew that the other section of the Commission were quite prepared to listen to reasonable complaints with a view of remedying them. Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> did not attempt to appear and ask for increased duties. But after the Commission has ceased sitting, he comes to Parliament, and asks for an increase. </para>

                        <para>- They made recommendations for increases in several instances where no increases were asked for. Time after time they did that. They made recommendations for increases without any evidence at all, and even when the evidence was dead against them, as has been shown from quotations by myself and other honorable members. In any case, the recommendation of the protectionist section was  £15,  or  30  per cent., whilst the Government propose that the duty shall be as high as  40  per cent. An idea seams to have got abroad that one or two of us have obtained possession of copies of the balance-sheets of Beale "and Company for the last couple of years ; that, we have done so is quite true. Now the statements that the industry is in a very bad way are not borne out by those balance-sheets. A statement has been generally circulated amongst honorable members to the effect that if this firm does not get an increase of duty it will have to close down. I do not know whether that statement will be persevered with now. </para>

                        <para>- They are authenticated copies of the actual balance-sheets vouched for by one whose reputation is of the highest. Let honorable members contradict the statements which I shall make upon the basis of these balance-sheets if they are wrong. But I will undertake to say that they are not wrong. Singularly enough, although <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> is asking for these increased duties, he has not produced his balance-sheet for this year, but is apparently holding it back until the Tariff on pianos has been dealt with. One would think that if the industry was in such a condition as to require heavier protection, amongst all the documents and circulars with which he has supplied honorable members, he would have furnished them with an up-to-date statement of his affairs. The first thing he should have done was. to show his last balance-sheet, to prove how necessary it was that he should have increased protection. But has he done so? No! Instead of doing that he has endeavoured to hide his balance-sheets. This it . a suspicious circumstance, which justifies us in the belief that large as his profits have been for the previous two years in all probability they have considerably increased during the past year. Indeed, I have private information that the increase is a most substantial one. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly ; but the- Treasurer said that all. the parts were made here, and yet we have a statement showing that, as usual, he is not supplied with correct information. A few days ago- I put to the Minister of Trade and Customs a question relating to the importation of pianos, and he admitted that an error had been made, the number of pianos imported'  into New South Wales having been exaggerated, although their aggregate invoice value was correctly stated. A peculiar feature of the incident is that the corrected figures were voluntarily communicated by the Department to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale,</inline> but were not furnished to the gentleman who had brought the facts under the notice of the Comptroller-General. </para>

The council of the association was to be instructed to demand that the Imperial Government should take energetic steps through the Consul-General to get the duly reduced. lt was mentioned that Australia had only one piano manufactory, and it was stated, on the authority of Australian papers, that the pianos it turned out were rubbish.

The Australian legislators who were likely to support the increased duties were declared to be shareholders and corrupt. Following this, there was held in Melbourne a meeting of piano importers, the chief business of which was the raising of a fighting fund to contest the new duties. </para>

                        <para>-Before the adjournment for lunch I was referring to an extract from the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin,</inline> which has been circulated amongst honorable members, and which, practically, charges honorable members who are advocating lower duties with being in the pay of a German syndicate that has subscribed funds for the purpose  of lobbying against an Australian industry. I was pointing out that this kind of thing  should be resented by honorable members, no matter to which party they belong. I do not care to mention names in these Tariff discussions, but in this case I am compelled to do so, because this business is generally known as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale's</inline> industry; and I say that the most active and also the most unfair lobbying has been going on for the purpose of inducing honorable members, not to decrease, but to increase, the duty imposed on pianos in the interests df this local, manufacturer. Yet no one on this side, so far as I am aware, has yet suggested that there has been anything in the nature of an attempt to bribe honorable members who favour high duties. </para>

I suppose that all lobbyists are receiving a salary for their services. The insinuation, . which practically amounts to a charge, contained in the extract from the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin,</inline> is not that the agents of foreign manufacturers or importers are being paid for lobbying, but that a fund has been established to insure the success of lobbying against the Australian industry.

                        <para>- There is an inference of dishonesty to be drawn from the article published by the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin,</inline> and it has been circulated amongst honorable members in order to influence their votes in favour of increasing the duties on pianos by means of a cunningly-worded base insinuation. That is my objection. This <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> extract has been circulated in the interests of a certain Australian firm, which is a large advertiser in its columns, in order to influence votes, and T say that that is a' most improper proceeding. If I were a protectionist and ever so much inclined to increase duties, the receipt of a circular of this kind, distributed in the interests of the 'person to be advantaged by the increase of duties, would be quite sufficient to induce me to refuse to give him the increased protection he desired." I resent the circulation of the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> extract as an attempt to unduly influence the members of the Committee. Speaking with reference to the piano which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> has on exhibition in this building, the Treasurer went into raptures this morning about this Australian industry, and claimed that all the parts of the instrument were made in Australia. But what do we find? On examination of the instrument the fact is disclosed that practically the whole of it has been imported. Almost the whole of the material and the manufactured mechanism of the piano in question- has been imported. </para>

                        <para>- The Committee certainly so understood the honorable gentleman.' He was going into raptures about this Australian industry, and yet we find that this piano might fairly be described as an imported instrument. Even the veneer on it was imported. There is not a particle of Australian wood in it, or at any rate, it is safe to say that there is not sufficient Australian wood in one of these pianos to boil a billy. </para>

I am credibly informed that he secured shares in the business worth about. £20,000 for  £5,000,  and that is how the business came into his hands. He was an importer himself.

                        <para>- Perhaps the honorable member will permit me to. finish the quotation before he interrupts. I will not answer his question until I have finished the quotation. I have already admitted that it was before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> bought all the . shares in this business, at one- fourth of their value, and began the manufacture of pianos. Although we now find him denouncing German labour conditions, he was then quite willing to sell German goods. I dare say  that if he found it more profitable he would not hesitate as a commercial man to do so to-day. I do not blame him for his action as a commercial man, but I do object to his posing as a great philanthropist and patriot when he is merely following his commercial instinct in the endeavour to ret  as  much profit as he can. I should not blame him if he admitted honestly that that it what he is doing - that he is "out for loot," as the honorable member for Dalley would describe it; that he is "on the make," and trying to obtain as large a return as possible from his business as a commercial concern. But when he seeks to pose as a. great Australian patriot and philanthropist, anxious to encourage Australian industry purely on patriotic ground and as a matter of sentiment and not purely of business, we have a right to examine the motive springs of his. action. I have here ' a complete translation of a letter  which he wrote to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Naumann,</inline> and 1 make this quotation from it - </para>

This is the great Australian patriot who now denounces German sweating conditions, and all that kind of thing. Let him be a man, and deal with this House on a. commercial basis. Let him say, ."1 am here to make money in the best way 1 can. If you are willing to let me dip my hands into the public Treasury, to increase .my already large profits, I am eager and anxious that you should do so." But do not let him come to 'this House, and say that he wishes us to impose these high duties because he is a patriot, who desires to encourage Australian industries, when the very piano which he has on exhibition here is composed almost entirely of foreign materials. I have no use for this "kind of patriot, though some of my protectionist friends approve his action. </para>

                        <para>- The point " is that he poses as an Australian manufacturer, not an importer of foreign manufactures. Other importers do not pose as patriots, but as commercial men in business to make money. They do not ask this House to give them special facilities to dip their bands into the public Treasury because they are Australian patriots. All that they ask is that they shall be left alone, and permitted to carry on their business. But this gentleman comes along, and says, "I am a great Australian patriot; therefore let me clip my -hands into the public Treasury, and fleece the consumers of these goods to the tune of 40 per cent., and whatever else I can get in addition as profit out of the duty; not to get me out of any difficulty, but to help me to build the great mansion, the foundations of which 1 have already reared." This is the man who we are invited to believe is carrying on a languishing industry suffering from the operation on arn already high Tariff ; the man who was afraid to go before the Tariff Commission to ask for increased duties, because he was unable to submit to the cross-examination which he knew must follow. This is the great Australian patriot who puts on exhibition in this building as an Australian piano an instrument nine-tenths of which is of foreign manufacture. </para>

What has <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> to say to that? Here is a chance for him to dispose profitably of his business if he thinks he is going 'to lose.

Forster, as auditors, by Octavious C. Beale, managing director, and Thomas Davidson, secretary. Here I am going to issue a challenge. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> will declare that this balance-sheet is a forgery, and that the signatures of the auditors, himself, and his secretary are forgeries, and give a guarantee that he will prosecute the man who supplied me with the information, I will give that man's name. This balance-sheet was obtained from somebody connected with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale's</inline> own business. If' the names of the auditors are forgeries, those gentlemen will be able to take the necessary action. </para>

Therefore, the question of whether they are making a profit or loss, as shown by their balance-sheet, is most important, and must have a direct influence on honorable member's votes. </para>

                        <para>- There was no necessity. The importers are not asking for the privilege of a monopoly. This man is asking for a monetary benefit at the expense of the taxpayers ; the importers are not. When a man asks for monetary gain to himself in his business at the expense of the community, it is his duty to show reasons for his claim. </para>

I do not propose to go into all the particulars of the balance-sheet, but I will lay it on the table of the House, and honorable members can study it for themselves.

                        <para>- I will not read all the details, but will give the totals. The other assets consist of merchandise and factory stocks, and materials on hand ; cash on hand, and at branches; factory, landed property, and buildings ; machinery, plant,  and  tools ; horses, vehicles, &amp;c. ; offices and shops, furniture and fittings ; patents and trade marks account; and sundry debtors; making the total assets £126,329 10s. 4d. The profit and loss account, which is of more importance, contains, on the one side, items for general expenses, wholesale expenses, discount, interest and exchange, advertising, stationery, bad debts (travellers' deficiencies, machine, piano, and sundry debtors), auditors' fees, subscriptions, legal expenses, fire insurance, piano fire insurance, and a profit and loss balance of  £2,605 13s. 7d.,  making a total of  £36,413 6s. 2d.  On the other side of the profit and loss account, appear - " balance from last year,  £3,105 13s. 6d. ;  forfeited premiums,  £3,001 8s. 8d."  It is a strange commentary on the quality of these pianos that there should be so many forfeited premiums. It does not look as if people particularly appreciated the instruments. In  1904-5,  the gross profits on the sale of pianos, over cost of manufacture, as shown under " Merchandise Account - Piano," was  £29,549 6s. 6d. </para>

The  1905-6  accounts show  £3,909  so written off; and, therefore, there must be added to the net profit, the sum of  £2,500,  and also  £3,000,  which, I am assured, is the salary of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale,</inline> who is virtually the proprietor, owning practically all the shares.

The fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> has not presented his balance-sheet for this year, or submitted his books to examination, isprima <inline font-style="italic">facie</inline> evidence that he is doing remarkably well. </para>

                        <para>- I have already pointed out that there is a gentleman in town who is willing to purchase his business, give <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> £1 for every share which originally cost  5s.,  take over all the assets, and, without any increase in the duty, give a bond to the Government to start a piano manufactory within twelve months. The effect of the duties on both pianos and parts, as proposed by the Government, will be to establish <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> in an absolute monopoly ; and I take it that even the most ardent protectionists are anxious to see other factories started. During the last two or three years <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> has commenced the manufacture of certain parts, though not all, used in the construction of his pianos; and unless parts be made free there will be no possible chance of any one successfully competing with him. I think I have adduced sufficient facts to show that there is no necessity for any increase in the duties ; and I invite the consideration of honorable members for a. section of the community, who, unfortunately, are too frequently forgotten when Tariff questions are before us. namely, the purchasers. We have had petitions presented to us, signed by  6,000  music teachers, against the imposition of the duties on pianos, which, to them, are a means of subsistence. Even when prices are low, it is a struggle with many teachers to obtain instruments; and' if we unduly inflate values, we shall inflict great disability on a deserving class. In passing, I may point out that the manager of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale's</inline> factory is <inline font-style="italic">a.</inline> German : so that not only are the parts of the instruments of foreign manufacture, but the management of the business is in the hands of a foreigner, al-&gt; though M.r. Beale complains so much about the competition of German and other manufacturers abroad. I should like to see a piano in every poor man's home; and, tearing in mind the music teachers, I think that pianos ought, like sewing machines, to be made free, as being a means of livelihood. I recognise, however, that there is no possible chance of the instruments being made free, -and, therefore, f move - </para>

                    <para>.- It is rather unfortunate, in considering a question of some national importance, that the names of individuals should be introduced. To my mind, it is of no importance whether it is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale, Mr. Jones, Mr. Smith,</inline> or any other person who engages in this industry. But, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale's</inline> name has been mentioned, it is, perhaps, proper to say a word or two, which appeal to me a.s representing the other side of the ledger from that presented by the honorable member for Lang. In the first place, that honorable member told us that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> is posing as a patriot, and claiming special consideration on that ground ; but I have not heard <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> make any such claim in connexion with his business. What he has claimed is that he has established a new industry, so far as Australia is concerned ; and I think that he is entitled to every -consideration in that regard. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> was, as the honorable member for Lang said, at one time an importer of pianos, and, when he carried on that business solely, we cannot blame him for seeking to get the best terms possible from foreign' manufacturers. But <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> thought there was an opening for a local manufacture of pianos, and engaged in the industry. I have no reason politically to speak one word for Mr: Beale. I understand that attempts have been made to influence some honorable members on the ground that he holds certain political opinions - that some members of the party to which I' belong have been approached with statements of what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr</inline> Beale had said at different times about that party, and so on. In my view, that has nothing whatever to do with the treatment to be accorded to this industry. I clare say if we looked into the matter, we should find that importers hold opinions just as strong as those of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> about the Labour Party. </para>

                        <para>- The importers ask that Australia may be sacrificed in order that they may exact their pound of flesh from the consumer. We all know that when the importers get the consumer under their thumb they are careful to exact the last ounce that can be got out of him. In justice to M.r. Beale, it ought to te said - whatever his political opinions may te, and I do not know what opinions he now holds in reference to the Labour Party - that during the whole period his factory has teen in existence, he has paid the highest wages in the furniture trade. The secretary of the Cabinet Makers' Union informed me some years ago that there was no man employing cabinet makers in Sydney who paid wages approaching those then paid by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale.</inline> Although the arbitration award recently given in connexion with the furniture trade prescribes certain .rates of wages <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> had been, and still is, paying wages in excess of those rates. I say that he is entitled to credit in that he has always paid good wages to the operatives in the industry in which he is engaged. I know that he has always observed the eight hours system - indeed, his is the only piano factory in the world which is conducted under that system. When the recent' arbitration award prescribed a lower rate of wages than he had been paying, he might, had he been of a grasping disposition, easily have attempted to reduce the wages paid by him to that level. But he has not done so. It has teen said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> exposes himself to criticism so far as his balance-sheet is concerned, because he is asking for monetary assistance at the expense of the taxpayers. </para>

                        <para>- I do not. I shall, however, refer to that aspect of the question presently. If protectionists admit that the imposition of an increased duty means granting monetary assistance to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> at the expense of the taxpayers, then the whole fabric of protection must fall, and we have no . right to support it. But I deny at once that any such assistance is involved in the . proposal to impose higher duties, and I deny it especially in view of the fact that a scheme has already been put forward for the initiation of what is known as the new protection - a scheme which is intended to protect both the wage-earner and the consumer, and which, I believe, will achieve something in the direction of preventing the consumer from being mulcted in increased prices as the result of the operation of higher duties. Those who hold that the imposition of an increased rate upon pianos will penalize the taxpayers for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale's</inline> benefit ought not to vote for any such duty, and they certainly ought not to support the new protection, because it is evident that they do not believe that it will prove efficacious. I. submit that if the new protection proposals achieve their object by protecting the consumer and the wage-earner alike, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> - in the event of increased duties being levied - will secure a larger market than he has previously enjoyed, his managerial expenses will be proportionately reduced, and he mav thus enjoy an increased profit. But the selling price of his pianos will have to remain what it has been. </para>

                        <para>- That was an instance in which a man did take advantage of an increase of the duty to increase his price to the consumer, and I showed my resentment of his action by pairing against the proposed increase of the duty. But in the present instance we have an assurance that the price of these pianos will not be increased by the manufacturer, and we also know that we intend to subject all industries to a rigid scrutiny in respect of the prices charged to the consumer, amongst other things. If the price of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale's</inline> pianos be increased an immediate reduction of the duty would be recommended, and personally I should vote forit. </para>

                        <para>- As a matter of fact, it is being done in (Canada at the present time. If two or three manufacturers are engaged in an industry, and only one is charging the consumer an unduly high price, it follows that the competition of his rivals will reduce prices to their normal level. I admit that where there is only one manufacturer engaged in an industry we are in an exceedingly awkward position. But how are we to increase the number of manufacturers? Shall we accomplish it by lowering the proposed duty?' I say, "Let us impose a duty which will make it unprofitable to bring cheap pianos. into Australia, and then more manufactories will spring up, and we shall thus bring about a degree of competition which will maintain prices at a reasonable level." </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member's assumption-, like many of his assumptions, is based upon an insecure foundation. We have been told by the honorable member for Lang that an offer was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wertheim</inline> to buy <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> out, and to give him- 20s. for every £1 share that he held in his company, but I did not hear any mention made of a guarantee that the industry would be carried on as it has been, or that the existing rates of wages would continue to be paid. According to the honorable member. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wertheim</inline> is so convinced of the enormous; profits to be made in the industry that he is prepared to give <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> 20s. for every  £1  that has been invested in it. What does that argue? If such grea.t profits are to be made out of the local: manufacture of pianos, why has not <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wertheim</inline> already started in opposition to Mr. Beale? Why have not any of the German manufacturers established branch factories in Australia? </para>

                        <para>- Undoubtedly. But a large proportion of them were not. Upon the table of the House is a catalogue showing that the wholesale price, of a certain piano in England was £9 odd. Now, nobody will contend that a decent instrument can be manufactured for that price, even with the aid of cheap labour. The average value of the German pianos imported last year was £19 odd. </para>

                        <para>- We all know that the difference between the cost of production and the selling price is very considerable. That is the result of the system which obtains. The same remark applies equally to sewing machines, harvesters, typewriters, and in a lesser degree to bicycles. An arbitrary price is. fixed for these articles, and that price is determined in a large measure by the cost incurred in canvassing for sales, and by the cost of distribution. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. With regard to the imported pianos, while they may be invoiced at  £35  each, they may be sold for  £70  each, or, under the time-payment system - which has something to commend it, although it involves a huge increase of price - for even more. If we are to have the development of Australian industries which we all desire, we must impose a higher duty upon pianos, as well as on other imported articles. With regard to the production of balance-sheets, 1 ask those who have cheerfully voted for duties of  35  per cent., why they did not require the production of balance-sheets in connexion with the local industries which those duties were designed to protect. </para>

                        <para>- There should be some degree of consistency. There was as much reason - no more and no less - for the production of balance-sheets in connexion with those industries as there is for the production of balance-sheets in connexion with the piano industry. We know on the authority of the unions concerned that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> pays the highest wages in Australia, but we had not that guarantee in regard to a. number of other industries to which we have teen reasonably liberal. The agent charged with the putting of the importers' case before Parliament has collected an enormous amount of material - including a speech delivered by me five years ago, in which I said that I would be content with a duty of  20  per cent, on pianos as a compromise - and he has also produced two balancesheets. </para>

                        <para>- I did not see that the production of that balance-sheet was pertinent to the question whether fair and reasonable wages were being paid. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale's</inline> balance-sheet, if it were necessary to make it public, should have been supplied to every honorable member. But those of us who were suspected of sympathizing, even remotely, with the establishing of the piano-making industry in Australia more firmly have not been given an opportunity to analyze these balance-sheets. I have been able to glance over them only cursorily. They are balance-sheets for the years ending  30th  June,  1905,  and  30th  June,  1906,  and do not seem to disclose abnormal profits. No doubt the Committee is sufficiently conversant with business methods to draw a distinction between money so invested that it will continue to return a fixed interest for an indefinite or prolonged time, in regard to which  3  per cent. ,  4  per cent., or  5  per cent, will be accepted, and money sunk in a business whose earnings will be subject to the fluctuations of the market, and may be reduced by competition. One naturally expects a larger return from a business investment than from an investment in Government debentures. It has become an unwritten law amongst business-men that an enterprise which will not return' something like  10  per cent, after making proper provision for depreciation and replacement of plant is not worth touching. If Messrs. Wertheim and Company were induced by a higher duty to make pianos and sewing machines in Australia, they would be a serious competitor to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale,</inline> whose business, laboriously built up in many years, might disappear in one or two.

                        <para>- The balance-sheet speaks of the shares as each fully paid. It is marvellous how these pseudo-free-traders alter their arguments to meet particular cases. When the last Tariff was under consideration, we were told that we had no right to consider the amount of capital written off by the Ballarat Woollen Mills Company ; that we must consider only the new capital, and the dividends paid' on it. But now it is alleged that, because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> was able to purchase for less than their nominal value some shares which had been fully paid up, the money for which had gone into the business, we should regard the capital as reduced accordingly. Yet the money represented by the nominal value of those shares has gone into the business. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Bass took exception to the action of the honorable member for tang in reading the details of the balance-sheets, and you ruled that the latter was trying to show that the industry does not need the assistance of an extra duty, inasmuch as it now pays a sufficient return. I propose to deal with the balance-sheet only so far as may be necessary to establish the position that the industry requires further assistance. </para>

I wish to make a point in regard to the year ending 30th June. 1906. The honorable member for Lang has said that the profit - not counting <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale's</inline> alleged salary of £3,000 - was £13,000.

                        <para>- I admit that it is a proper thing to bring the sum into the profit account, but not in relation to that particular year. Suppose that in his business the honorable member anticipated two years ago that he would have a certain amount of bad debts, and wrote them off, and that, this year the moneys had come unexpectedly to hand, he would not be justified in including them in the profit for the year. He would have to show the recovery of the bad debts as a special item. </para>

                        <para>- It is an abnormal recovery which would not be credited by the honorable member to the current year. It must be shown, of course, for the purpose of income tax, and to ascertain where he was in regard to his capital account, but it should not be credited to the profits of the year to which it was accidentally attached. Therefore we may arrive at this position: that the profit of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale's</inline> business for the year 1906 was £7,323. I do not think that any one who has a knowledge of business will say that that is too great a profit for a year, or in general relation to business, that if is even a good profit. </para>

                        <para>- The gas company is making . a.n abnormal profit, because it charges an abnormal price. It demands twice the rate levied in Birmingham or Manchester. I recognise that honorable members who object to this duty from the free-trade stand-point are fully justified. They want to insure free imports and le't every industry take its chance. I do not quarrel with that attitude, although I do not agree with it. But it seems to me  that protectionists have no possible justification for drawing any line of demarcation between the piano industry and any other. </para>

                        <para>- I know the speech by heart. I have read it in a typewritten document, and I do not wish to get away from it in the slightest degree. What I said in 1902 was that the industry had been started without protection, and that 20 per cent., as against no duty, was as much as could be expected for it. . The Tariff of 1901-2 was an experiment. We wanted to see how industries would get On with, for the most part, reasonable duties, and if the honorable member for Coolgardie will take the trouble to look up the general speech I made on the question, he will find that I said that, so far as my vote was concerned, I would not sanction high duties In an experimental Tariff, because we wanted to see how things under the new conditions, which no one understood, were likely to work, and I followed that out. Since then we have had an experience extending over five years, and we know that the imports of German pianos have been a constantly increasing quantity. </para>

                        <para>- I do not see how that bears on the question which we are now considering. My statement was that the number, or, rather, the value, of German pianos imported into Australia was increasing. In view of that experience, and. our experience of the piano which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> has turned out, and which no one will say is not a good average instrument, there is every reason for those who so desire to change their opinion as to the rate of duty which is necessary to protect the industry. I have come to the conclusion, after five years' experience, that there is a need for an increased duty, and I trust that it will be voted. </para>

                    <para>.-I am very sorry that there has been so much heat imported into this discussion. I agree with the honorable member for South Sydney that it should be confined to the individual merits of the instruments with which we are dealing under this item. Honorable members have not yet realized, I think, that this is a question of the encouragement of one of the greatest of the arts, and that there is a considerable difference between a boot-jack and a piano. </para>

                        <para>- No; nor do I intend at any time to reflect on the Colonial instrument. The point is that some persons prefer the Australian piano. In my opinion it is a very good instrument, and I do not wish to say anything against it. On the other hand, there are some artists who prefer an American piano or an English piano or a German piano. All those tastes have to be met. Some artists will sing to and play an Australian piano with great pleasure to themselves, but other artists sav that it is impossible to do  justice to themselves with anything but a German piano. That is what we have to consider in dealing with this question. How are the public to be best suited ? </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member is such an excellent hand at organizing that he might possibly do even that.  We have to give the public a fair and square deal. We have to treat <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale,</inline> the Australian manufacturer, fairly. We also have to treat the public fairly. But quite apart from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> and the importers of pianos, it is our duty to consider the interests of a large number of people throughout Australia who are making their living by giving instruction in music, and the still larger number who to their own great enjoyment love to listen to music in their own homes. Of those whose interests we have to bear in mind the greater number by far are those who enjoy music at home. It would be a great advantage to the whole of the people of Australia and particularly to our young folks if there were a piano in every house and instruction in music for every child in Australia. Quite apart from the advantage of the instruction itself, it would be an introduction to the gentler arts and a valuable discipline in time and method. </para>

                        <para>- A great many, I am proud to say. There are Australians whose musical taste has been developed in this country, and who, when they have gone abroad, have electrified the musical world by their talents. It is very likely that if we were to ask these Australians what instruments they prefer some would mention' one piano and some another, and each would say that the piano which he favoured was the instrument best adapted for displaying his talents. When we are asked to grant an increased duty in favour of art industry we have to look into the details and see whether the demand is justified. If our Australian manufacturer were in a bad way, if his output were declining, if his profits were diminishing, I should say that we were bound to impose an increased duty But we find on inquiry that the facts are not so. I give our Australian manufacturer every credit for his enterprise and . ability. I am delighted to know that he pays in his eight hours factory the best wages in the world. </para>

During the present year the balance-sheet of the company, if it could be obtained, would probably show a much larger profit. Now I am not objecting to this profit. I am delighted to see that it has been -made, and that the factory has been doing so well. I wish it every success in the future. I hope that the business will go on increasing. </para>

                        <para>- I have  no  objection to urge to the way in which the consumer has been treated by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale.</inline> I have  no  desire to go into his profits, or into the difference between manufacturing cost and cost to the public. That is a matter between him and the public. He gives the public a fair deal, and the- public have a perfect right to buy their instruments from him. Under the previous Tariff, we gave a protection of  20  per cent, to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale.</inline> Under that protection he has been able to increase his business, to pay and treat his employes well, and to make for himself a reasonable profit. Under these circumstances, I say that we should be doing an injustice to the music-loving public of Australia if we increased the duty beyond that charged under the old Tariff. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member raises a fresh point. It has been shown that the Australian manufacturer has done well under the old duty. What he has done has been creditable to him as an Australian manufacturer. Why, if he can do so well under these conditions, should not other manufacturers be able to do the same? Shall we secure more competition by the imposition of higher duties ? In what way will the public be benefited by them? The honorable member for Riverina said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> had reduced the price of his pianos. If that be so, he is giving the public a fair deal. The people, however, desire to be free to select either an Australian or a foreign-made piano. If they are content to buy an inferior instrument that is a matter of  no  concern to us ; but if they do purchase a foreign-made piano they must pay more for it. We shall not be dealing fairly with the great army of music teachers and music lovers in Australia unless we reduce the duties to such a level that whilst protecting the local manufacturer they will not prevent the public from obtaining a good imported instrument at a fair price. The circulars that have been issued in reference to these duties display a good deal of enterprise on the part of both sides. I most strongly condemn the reprint from the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> which was read this morning, by the honorable member for Lang, and which I regard as a gross breach of the privileges of the House. It practically suggests that honorable members who maintain that the duties on pianos should be kept at a reasonable level, and that we should have only a. slight increase on the rates under the old Tariff, are subsidized by German pianoforte makers. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member should not have shown a disposition to sympathize with the statements contained in the circular before they had been read to the Committee.

                        <para>- Most certainly; we have simply to determine whether or not the Australian manufacturer was sufficiently protected under the old Tariff. I think I have shown that he has been doing very well, and, that being so, we are not justified in granting him, at the present time, any material increase on the old duties. </para>

                    <para>. - The issue of the circular to which the honorable member for Corangamite has referred caused me great astonishment. Whether it was sent to me or not I cannot say, nor had I heard that such, a circular was in existence until the matter was mentioned. I had no recollection of having received any private communication from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. George</inline> Allan; but I at once sent to the Department to ascertain whether there were any official papers relating to the matter. As the result' of my inquiries I find that on the 13th September <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. George</inline> Allan left in my hands - confidentially, I presume - the document to which he refers. I produce the document, which, honorable members will notice, has been officially registered in the Department. I had forgotten its existence. </para>

                        <para>- I have not made any statement to him in regard to the document. I also find that' another document, containing . a great deal of the same information, was sent by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. George</inline> Allan, presumably to the Comptroller-General. Here are the official documents. That which I received at once passed from my hands into the Department, and was registered. I cannot say where <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> obtained any information regarding this matter, but I believe that he knows as much about the business as most people in the trade, and could make calculations as to the business done by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Allan</inline> or any one else. So far as I am aware, I have never received any private documents from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Allan.</inline> If I had done so, I certainly would not have communicated their contents to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> or any one else. </para>

I had forgotten about them, and I could only imagine that if I had received any such documents they would be found in the Department of Trade and -Customs. I at once asked the Comptroller-General to send down to the office to find what documents were there. I have  just  received the documents which I hold in my hand, and they include amongst others the one to which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Allan</inline> referred.

                        <para>- It seems to me that they are quite beside the question. That they are dealing in pianos is  merely  an incident, whilst it is our business to legislate for the good of the country, so that commerce can be conducted satisfactorily. That <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale's</inline> business should" be seriously discussed in this Chamber seems to me to be reducing the status of this Parliament to that, of a debating society. The balance-sheet which has been referred  to here only goes to show that under the duty of 20 per cent. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> was able to make his business pay. The fact that he made a large sum of money  out of his business gives une very great satisfaction, because I hope that all men who embark in a business in Australia will" be able to make it pay. But honorable members have only to look at the establishment that is in existence in Sydney toknow_ that the business pays. No man will increase the size of his business premises and engage more  employes  unless the business he does warrants him in doing so. We have only to consult the circulars sent out by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> in the ordinary course of business to know that his output has" wonderfully increased, and on that account, from my point of view, he is deserving of some consideration. I am prepared to give him all the consideration he deserves. The instrument which lie has- exhibited here must be regarded as a very fine piece of furniture. Whether it is also a fine musical instrument, which satisfies the taste of the public, is a matter with which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> is concerned. If the public do not wish to have one of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale's</inline> instruments, they will not buy it. He charges a very high price for his instruments, about 100 per cent, on cost price, and evidently the public cannot get anything cheaper, or they would not buy them. He gives terms to purchasers, and very long terms, and that proves that his profits must be large. If he made a big profit last year he was fortunate, but lie might make a big loss next year. That is all I have to say, so far as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> is concerned ; but I have something to say about the interests of the general public, who should be considered in all these matters. If an industry can continue to exist without increased protective duties, what more have we to consider? After a long discussion some years ago we decided that 20 per cent, was a sufficient duty to impose, and at that time we had under consideration the duties imposed in the several States and in New Zealand. A duty of -20 per cent, was levied on pianos in New Zealand. We also had under notice the fact that in Canada the duty was 30 per cent. ; that Western Australia had' fixed duties of £5 and £15; Tasmania a duty of 20 per cent. ; South Australia, 15 per cent. ; Queensland, fixed duties of <inline font-style="italic">j£6</inline> and £12 <inline font-style="italic">;</inline> and Victoria, fixed duties of £5 and £15. In New South Wales, where this industry was established, there was no duty, and the industry was paying its way under conditions of free-trade against the world in pianos. The industry had increased its output in competition with the world. </para>

I am prepared to allow him to import these parts duty free. That is a fair proposition to make to him. As he succeeded so well in the past I am unwilling to upset his business, and I am prepared to give him, as regards parts, just what he had in New South Wales and let him compete with the world. If his industry cannot live with the advantage of the free importation of all the parts he requires for the manufacture of his instruments let it do the other thing, and let him go into some other business. </para>

                        <para>- It would put him on a level with the best English and  German makers who use French parts, and if he is given in addition a duty of 20 per cent, on the finished article, which I think he is likely to get, that should serve him excellently. I do not think there is a great deal to debate in this question. All we have heard so far has been a discussion of the business affairs of private individuals. I have noticed that a very large number of people go into the piano business, and when we find persons falling over each other in their' effort to' get a share in a particular business we maybe satisfied that there is a lot of money in it. As a free-trader I should like to have commerce as untrammelled as possible. If we give <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> the advantage of the free importation of the parts he requires - and I mention his name in this connexion because he represents the industry in Australia - and an increased duty is imposed, I should say that foreign firms would be induced to establish themselves in Australia so as to continue to reap the profits derived from the trade which by their enterprise they have carried on in almost every part of the Commonwealth. However, the matter is one which is of real interest to the public, because that a person should have to pay  £50  for a piano which could be bought in Leipzig for  £20  is a scandal. We should do what we can to reduce the price charged for pianos so that our people may be able to get a good instrument into their houses. I am told that pianos are imported here for <inline font-style="italic">£6,</inline> and I suppose <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> could also make cheap pianos. It seems to me that to impose the high fixed duties which the Government propose upon these instruments would injure the trade in Australia and would force our people to use an inferior instrument. There is a piano exhibited in this building which cost in Europe less than  £30,  and the price paid for it here is just under  £60.  It is clear that the business of the importation of pianos is- thriving in Australia. </para>

A good check would be to allow others who may be competing to see the materials on which a certain suggestion may have been made to the Minister. I felt that some time ago, when I introduced what I regarded as a deputation to the Minister. I left the room when I found that I could not agree with their request. I found that it was not reported afterwards, so that I suppose the interview was really one of those private ones which are in the long run somewhat dangerous. I am afraid, from the heat and force that have been thrown into this debate, that if some of the dead poets were to revisit us, they would find it necessary to, recast some of their observations regarding music.

We have had some figures from the Treasurer as to the total wages paid in an Australian factory, to the enterprise and skill of whose manager I must bear, from what I have read, my humble testimony of admiration. We welcome the enterprise, so long as the ways are not too devious, of any one engaged in an Australian industry, and if he makes it a success, even ff the balance-sheet shows a profit of 15 or 20 per cent., so long as that is not abnormal, there is nothing to complain of, nor does it affect the question of the duty which we should impose, because, if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> had the good or bad luck - good from the point of view of the public, although, perhaps, bad from his own - to have many local competitors, I dare say the profits might not be quite so high, although the incidence of the duty upon the general public, or loss to the Treasury, would be just the same. We have to consider what the public have to pay for the alleged benefits conferred on the community by an increase of duty. The Treasurer said that the wages paid were £60,000 per annum. Assuming a consumption of pianos of about 11,000 or 12,000 - which, on the figures given before the Tariff Commission is not far wrong - and taking the duty as about £5 on the ordinary piano, multiplying the two, you get £60,000 a year as the duty proposed by the Minister, which amounts exactly to the total wages paid at present bv <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale.</inline> I do not say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> gets that sum - but £60,000 a year is a. very big outlay at the expense of those who use pianos - nor that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> requires the protection it implies, because, according to the evidence, he is flourishing, and his business has increased through his enterprise, ability, and push,  by 50 per cent, since 1900. But we are giving away £60,000 per annum for, shall we say, the operatives who are engaged in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale's</inline> works, and whose case has been put to-day by the honorable member for Dalley. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale's</inline> output in 1904, according to the Tariff Commission, was 1,500 pianos, and at £5 apiece the total amount that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> could get on his present output, out of the £60,000 would be £7,500. I dp hot know how much of that will <inline font-style="italic">so</inline> to his operatives. They may get a shilling or two more a week. It would  only mean a few shillings a week extra to the men if the whole of it was divided amongst them, and I suppose that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> will not give them the whole of it. We know that the men do not get such treatment. That could only be brought about by a very effective form of the so-called new protection, which we have not found yet. But supposing that the men were offered the whole of the £7,500 a year, surely they would not be so unpatriotic, as to tate it when it meant an additional price tor pianos, which are the little enjoyments of their own class, and which help to alleviate the hardships of their daily life. Surely they are not going to ask for that addition to their wages at an expense to the public, not of £7,000 only, but of £60,000 a year? That is the lesson that 1 have drawn from the figures given by the Treasurer. We have heard a good deal about encouraging local production. I do not want to say anything about the quality of the local piano. Some may say that its tone is not altogether as resonant as that of some other instruments. I have heard that said, and the same remark may be made about some of the American pianos. But pianos, wherever made, have, though in a less marked degree, that peculiarity which is common to most musical instruments - the timbre depending to a large extent upon proper seasoning, and upon the perfect balance of the parts, so that there is no irregularity or want of consonance in the wave lengths of the strings, and in the particular kinds of woods that are dovetailed one into the other to make up the instrument. To say that that highest skill, . which does not come by the sudden application of  mathematics to money, but from that indefinable genius which is the result perhaps of prolonged evolution through generations, can be induced by the mere imposition of a 10 or 15 per cent, higher rate of duty, is arrant nonsense. If a mere duty can give the requisite quality in all cases, how is it that there are six or seven different leading classes of pianos in Germany? One performer will not play at a concert on the piano of a particular maker. He prefers perhaps a piano with a greater breadth of tone, ring, and penetrating power, but that piano might be utterly unsuited to another performer, especially if, instead of being one of those acrobatic persons who fill large halls - more pugilists than real artists - he happens to be an artist in the old sense of the word, as it was applied to Liszt's playing. The piano which he would select would be one of softer tone, that would fill perhaps a moderate-sized drawing room. We all have different ears, or perhaps we would not so often shut them to the speeches of honorable members who sit on opposite sides to us. If we try to encourage or confine our choice to purely local production, a long time will elapse before we attain, through varieties of kind, that development of tone, and peculiarity of shading, which have so much to do with the psychological enjoyment of music, and that have been attained in some of the older portions of the world through the wide field of competition and experience. That is One of the reasons why, whilst desirous of encouraging local skill, and not attempting in any way to impugn the quality of our local product, I am still somewhat of an eclectic in this matter, and desire, as representative of the citizens who may have an interest in buying pianos, to free myself from prejudice, and to be unaffected by any attempt of the Treasurer to impose a duty that will rather limit than extend the power of the public to purchase the pianos that they fancy. There is no doubt that music has a good deal to do with the civilities of life. You can abuse music, and part of the reason for the waning of our enjoyment ot it in after-years is over-familiarity with certain tunes.', I do not advocate such a wide diffusion of music that every house shall ring with the playing of pianos and the scraping of fiddles, because temperance in eis. as in other matters, preserves the power of enjoyment, and when there is too great a dwelling on particular melodies the appetite mav, in the words of the poet, " Sicken and so die." But without a judicious admixture of the enjoyment which ordinary minds can get from music, with the harsh conditions of modern life - of which the man with only two or three pounds a week gets his full share - we shall never reach that level of comparative comfort and general culture - using the &gt;ord in its proper sense - that we all, whether Socialists or not, aim at here. In the interests, therefore, of the 12,000 purchasers of pianos per annum - and I suppose they will be represented by an increasing number each year - I appeal to the Committee not to impose a duty that is beyond. I might say, the necessities - although there is no necessity for an increase disclosed by the evidence given before the Tariff Commission - and that certainly might mean a greater difficulty on the part of men with moderate incomes in buying one of the few solaces of their daily lives. The Treasurer has given us various prices at which pianos can be imported, running from about £9 up to. £20. On the corrected estimate of the Customs Department, the average cost, for clearance before duty, pf pianos imported from Germany is £23 odd. That is a good export price for a piano, and I believe that the local piano does not cost more than that to produce. I have seen estimates of the cost of local production, running from £16 <inline font-style="italic">t0 j£23-</inline> I have also seen deductions from the figures said to be given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> himself, which indicate - I do not say prove - that his cost of production locally is not greater than the average cost at which pianos can be imported. If that is so, there is absolutely nothing pregnant in the figures quoted by the Treasurer. There is at present a duty of 2b per cent, on pianos, which, with a cost of production of £20, is supplemented by a natural protection of about 50 per cent, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem.</inline> The lowest cost of importation from Germany that I have seen is about £9, so that, adding that to the incidence of the present duty, there is a pretty effectual protection even with a 20 per cent. rate. In those circumstances, it is uncalled for - in fact, it is a most inexpedient, if not foolish, policy - to ask the Committee, without rhyme or reason, even from the protectionist point of view, and with many counter reasons from the point of view of the revenue and of the general consumer, to put about 50 per cent, more on to a rate of duty which, up to the present, has been marked by increased enterprise and success on the part of the local industry. </para>

                    <para>.- In regard to the leakage of information from the Customs to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr</inline> Beale, the extraordinary suggestion has been made that he had obtained it bv a sort of divination. The honorable member for Wimmera, for instance, suggested that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> might have obtained possession of the information in some such way. I intervene at this moment only to show that the words quoted in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale's</inline> circular are identical in every respect with the memoranda handed to the Treasurer by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Allan</inline> in September last, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale's</inline> circular reached honorable members about the middle of last month, or a little earlier. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Allan's</inline> memoranda consist of four paragraphs. I will read the two documents paragraph by paragraph, alternately, so that their absolute identity may be perceptible to everybody. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Allan's</inline> first paragraph is as follows - </para>

                    <para>.- Every honorable member has, 1 am sure, made up his mind how he is going to vote, and it is undesirable to discuss the question at any great length. However, there are one or' two points to which no special reference has been made, and to which I should like to call attention. As to the document, to which the honorable member for Coolgardie has called attention, there is nothing to show that, in some way, the information leaked out of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Allan's</inline> office. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Allan</inline> himself handed me the only other copy which he had typed at the time, and which I have shown to the Treasurer, who, I am very glad to find, has been able to discover the original document in the Department. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. George</inline> Allan very distinctly desires that no personal reflection should be'made on the Treasurer, who, he believes, acted in good faith in the matter. One fact to which I wish particularly to refer is that there have been several petitions presented to us. Although I know that customarily petitions are placed where they are never seen again, those to which I refer are very important, representing, so far as Victoria is concerned,  2,648  teachers of music. It is estimated that throughout the Common-, wealth there are over 5,000 people thus employed, and they deserve some consideration, inasmuch as pianos compose their tools of trade, and, as such, should not be made too costly. But there is another aspect of the question to which I desire to draw attention. There has been a series of examinations conducted under the authority of the Trinity College of Music, London, and the Royal Academy of Music ; and the candidates presented number thousands. While we have to pay some regard to the piano-making industry, we must not forget those vast numbers of users, whether they use the piano as a means of livelihood or merely as a means of pleasure. This is an aspect which has to be considered, quite irrespective of the merits of the manufactures of the particular firms which have been mentioned. Personally, I think it most unfortunate that there should have been so much reference to one firm ; because, in my opinion, the question ought to be considered solely from its utilitarian and commercial point of view. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> deserves every credit for the enterprise and ability he has shown in inaugurating this industry, which he did not enter from any philanthropic motives, but with the purely commercial object of making it profitable. It has been shown by the balance-sheet submitted this afternoon, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> has made a financial success of his enterprise. It has not been made clear as to how that balance-sheet was secured, because it is only recently that the law was passed by which public companies are called upon to produce their statements of accounts. However, the balance-sheet has been made -public, and has not been successfully challenged. It is to be regretted that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale's</inline> balance-sheet for the present year, which might have been placed upon record, has not yet been filed. In the absence of any contention that the balance-sheet is incorrect, we are entitled to conclude that the industry cannot be regarded as a struggling one. </para>

I think that the duty proposed by the honorable member for Dalley may be regarded as the highest which this Committee is likely to accept. Of course very much will depend upon the attitude which the Government take up in regard to the duty to be levied upon the various parts of pianos which cannot be manufactured in the Commonwealth, or which cannot be manufactured here satisfactorily.

            <para>Dear Sir,</para>
            <para>I am willing to enter into a bond for £5,000 to establish a large piano factory at Melbourne during the next twelve months, provided that the following piano parts be exempt from duty : - Actions, complete or in parts, strings, felts, and felting, hammers, ivories and  keys thereto, handles and hinges for pianos; sounding boards in the rough, veneers for pianos in the rough. All these parts have hitherto been free under the Tariff of 1902, and it is of the utmost importance that they remain free. No new maker would otherwise have the slightest chance of successfully competing against the old-established factory of Beale and Company Limited. The reasons are given in my memo, attached hereto. This is such an essential and vital condition that even a higher duty on pianos -would offer no inducement to start a piano factory unless the parts mentioned are put on the free list. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> has gained his experience during the last fourteen years, an experience which any manufacturer now starting has to gain. During all these years he imported these parts free, and only during the last two or three years has he started making a few of them. To a new maker, this would be Impossible, for some years also. I am quite satisfied with the late duty of 20 per cent, (would, of course, not object if it were in creased to 25 per cent, on foreign pianos), provided the foregoing request be granted. </para>
            <para class="block">The gentleman who has made this offer is financially very substantial. He is well known in commercial circles, and therefore his offer may be regarded as a business one which the Treasurer may well take into consideration. He undertakes, if the parts that he has enumerated are admitted free, to start a large piano factory here. We should thus be assured of a healthy competition in the industry. I have also received from a gentleman in this city the following letter - </para>
            <quote>
                <para>I should like to point out that the freight and charges on the British piano cost so much' more than the German, that it practically puts the British piano out of the market in Australia and Tasmania. The general trade who stock only German pianos have recently inspected and approved of, also ordered, pianos made by my people in London. But without the prospect of a preferential Tariff, the step would not have been taken. The New Zealand Tariff of 20 per cent. British and 30 per cent, foreign works well, and my business and the British EmU trade generally in that country is satisfactory, but without a similar preference in this country and Tasmania, I might as well give up my work here. I feel sure you will give this important matter the attention it deserves.  </para>

            <para class="block">From official figures I gather that the average invoiced price of pianos imported into Australia during 1905 was £19 13s. 7d., though the factory cost of these instruments found in an ordinary dealer's showrooms would be much higher. A fair average would be from £18 to, say, £50. Taking as an illustration a piano which cost <inline font-style="italic">£20</inline> at the factory, the effect of the Government proposals would be to charge duty upon £25 6s., which amount is made up as follows : - Invoiced price of piano <inline font-style="italic">£20.</inline> cost of packing case <inline font-style="italic">-£2</inline> 5s., charges to f.o.b. London or Hamburg 15s., and 10 per cent, added by Customs £2 6s. A duty of 40 per cent, upon the aggregate of. these sums would amount to <inline font-style="italic">£10</inline> 2s.  sd.  Upon a piano costing £35 at the factory, duty would be levied on the following, charges : Invoiced price of piano £35, cost of packing case <inline font-style="italic">£.2</inline> 5s., charges to f.o.b. London or Hamburg 15s., 10 per cent, added by Customs £3 16s., or a total of £41 16s. The duty of 40 per cent, in this instance would represent <inline font-style="italic">£16</inline> 14s. 5d. Upon a piano costing £50 at the factory, duty would be levied upon the following' charges : Invoiced price of piano <inline font-style="italic">£50,</inline> cost of packing case <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> 5s., charges to f.o.b. London or Hamburg 11s., 10 per cent, added by Customs <inline font-style="italic">£5</inline> 6s., or a total of £58 6s. The proposed duty of 40 per cent, upon this amount would represent £23 6s. 6d. In addition to these charges there has to be added the import charges from factory to Melbourne, consisting of packing case, expenses to f.o.b., sea freight, wharfage, cartage, unpacking and polishing at Melbourne, insurance, buying commission and exchange on draft. These charges amount to an average of from £8 to <inline font-style="italic">£10</inline> upon each piano. Under these circumstances, it is clear that the duty upon a piano which is invoiced at £20 would be <inline font-style="italic">j£io</inline> 2s.  sd.,  and the landing charges £8. Iri other words, it would cost £18 2s. 5d. to land the instrument in Melbourne without any profit to the importer being added. This is equivalent to a tax of 90 per cent. Similarly, upon a piano invoiced at £35 the duty would be £16 14s.  sd.,  and the landing charges, say, £9, or a total of £25 14s. 5d., which is equivalent to 74 per cent. Upon a piano invoiced at £50 the duty would be £23 6s. 6d., and the landing charges, say, £10, or a total of £33 6s. 6d., which is equal to 66 per cent. Such duties would mean ruin to the importing houses. ' They would shut out all the high-class instruments, including large grands, which are' generally used for concerts, such as the Bechstein, Lipp, Steinway, Erard, &amp;c. The figures which I have quoted .will suffice to show that the industry of piano-making already enjoys a large natural protection, and the proposed duties would fall very heavily upon music teachers and musical students throughout the Commonwealth. These are points to which reference has not previously been made, and, therefore,  1  think that I am justified in asking the Committee to consider them. </para>

                    <para>.- During the course of this debate a statement has been made which reflects seriously upon the administration of our Customs Department. A charge of having divulged official information was levelled against the Treasurer, but the leakage has now been sheeted home to the Department of Trade and Customs. I ask honorable members whether they are prepared to let the matter rest where it is. Certainly, I am not content to do so. The Treasurer is to be complimented upon having regarded the information given to him as official, and upon having forwarded it to the proper quarter. An inquiry ought now to be instituted to ascertain why the Customs Department has not regarded that information as sacred. </para>

                <para class="block">The Minister of Trade and Customs ought certainly to pursue the matter further, with&gt; a view to discover who is at fault. Personally, I intend to as'k him a question in regard to it at the earliest possible opportunity. The honorable member for Kooyong, with others, has been ringing the changes upon <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale's</inline> balance-sheet. It is certainly strange that practically at the end of the Tariff discussion we should" have a balance-sheet presented to us by an interested industry. But even that side of the question is" not complete, because we have not yet seen the balance-sheets, of importers. I appeal to the Committee to say whether such a large increase of the duty as that proposed bv the Government should, be granted. The honorable member for Maranoa paid a great deal of attention to a poor unfortunate called the honorable member for Dalley. It is not often that any one says anything on behalf . of the honorable member for Dalley, but I am going to defend him on this occasion. As a rule he can look after himself. The honorable member for Maranoa said that five years ago the honorable member for Dalley declared that, as a free-trader, he would stultify himself if he voted for a higher duty on pianos than 15 per cent. It is quite' correct that the honorable member for Dalley said that. In 1902 he was pledged to his constituents to vote for free-trade, and he adhered to his pledges throughout the big Tariff struggle, whether the industries affected were or were not those of his own electorate. But after that experience, and the experience of subsequent Parliaments, he, fourteen months ago, stated on the floor of this chamber that in future he would know when to put up the umbrella. He had discovered that so-called free-traders were rabid when industries in their own constituencies were not affected, but became protectionists of the deepest dye when such industries were threatened. Accordingly, he said that when next he went before his electors he would put the case clearly before them. He had discovered that the Victorian representatives took care to look after Victorian interests, and he was determined that New South Wales industries should not suffer by any votes which he might give. " He did not change his attitude without consulting his electors. The policy .which he has adopted has been imitated by a large number of so-called free-traders, which is the most sincere form. of flattery which they could have shown. Some honorable members have changed their fiscal opinions within five minutes. The honorable member for Maranoa has made very wonderful changes since 1902. He has stated that he is willing to vote protection where the industry concerned will give employment. Piano-making is an industry which gives a good deal of employment, but, for some reason, he baulks when asked to protect it, although rumour says that a fortnight ago he was a top-duty man, so far as pianos are concerned. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Dalley must be given time. He has one eye on the squire and one on the fire, to use the words of an old song. If piano-making were a Victorian industry, the moderate protectionists on the Opposition corner benches would have spoken of it as a wonderful industry, employing expert workmen to the number of over 400 hands, and therefore requiring protection. It seems to have made a good deal of difference to them that the industry is a' New South Wales one. However, they have declared that they are federalists, and I wish to give them an opportunity to show that they are. But although I am proud of the industry, I refuse to be the phonograph of the man at the head of it, as I refuse to be the phonograph of the importers or their agents. I have received many telegrams from those connected with this business, urging me not to vote for more than a certain duty. But, while I respect my correspondents, I shall act on my own responsibility. So far as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> is concerned, I say good luck to him. I am glad that he has- charge of such an industry, that the factory is in my electorate, and, better still, that the employes, who are highly skilled, are getting good wages. I am not concerned . about the profits he makes. If we ask for a balance-sheet in one case, we should ask for one in every case. If we did that it might be said that we are going in for profit sharing, and the Labour Party might say, " Let us nationalize all these profitable industries." The Committee has voted duties of 35 per cent, and 30 per cent, for the protection of the furniture trade. The moderate protectionists had nothing to say about the profits of furniture-making. Regarding pianos merely as furniture - the making of them requires much greater skill and care than the making of furniture - the rates I have proposed are lower than the rates on furniture. We also imposed a thumping duty on children's boots, the making of which employs only a few persons. The Minister will, I believe, not insist upon fixed duties for pianos. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot believe that the average teacher of music uses a grand piano costing over £200. Reference has been made to the new protection. The leader of the Opposition, an ardent freetrader, is committed to the new protection, and so is the honorable member for Dalley, whose opposition to the old protection has been largely based on the ground that the manufacturers have got the advantage of it, while the employés have been sweated and the public victimized. If this industry receives protection, it must come under legislation requiring the manufacturer to share with his employes, and with the purchasers of pianos. I am willing to make a trial of the new protection. If, with  the possibility of bringing it into  force  I were not to persist in fighting the German manufacturers,. I should be unquestionably a foreign trader. We have committed ourselves to the policy of preference. We have acknowledged that British enterprise has suffered severely from the competition of Germany. We fear the. Germans because of their skill and their commercial acumen, which enable them to undersell British productions in many of the markets of the world. Therefore, we wish to give British manufacturers a preference. In  1906  we imported  1,500  pianos from Great Britain, and  10,300  from Germany, so that there is room for preference here. If they have been sending only  1,500  out of  12,000  instruments, while Germany has been sending  10,000  odd, there is room for at least a preference of  5 <inline font-style="italic">PeT</inline> cent, to the. Motherland as against Germany. By my amendment I ask for an increase of  5  per cent, on the old duty of  20  per cent. It is a most reasonable request. I am not dealing now with the manufacturing industry, but with the importers. By wire and statement they say, "If a duty of  25  per cent, is levied, the business will be ruined." From the invoiced prices of. pianos landed here, and from the values which they have obtained in the open market, we know that they, have a bigger margin to work on than the  5  per cent. So far as British goods are concerned, I am only asking the Committee to reduce the importers' margin by  5  per cent. As they have the arrangement of business they can get over that difficulty to a great extent. Their possibility of rearrangement and better management has not yet been exhausted, and an increased duty of  5  per cent, as against British imports is not an insurmountable difficulty to them. So far as Germany is concerned, I only ask for a preference of  5  per cent, to British imports, and an increase of  10  per cent, on the original duty. When we were dealing with the Tariff in  1902,  we were contesting a policy for Australia. We were armed with a mandate from the public to frame the Tariff according to our ideas. Free-traders and protectionists took count of the duties imposed on pianos in the various States prior to Federation, and as the result of a long discussion, we came to a compromise of  20  per cent. Since then the politics of Australia have changed remarkably. The last battle in the electorates was not fought on the fiscal question - at any rate in New South Wales. The struggle in that State was between Socialism and anti-Socialism, and the question of fiscalism was not presented to the people. Preferential trade was a new idea to which honorable members 'on this side have subscribed equally as warmly as have honorable members on the other side. I do not believe that more than five members of the House were opposed to the principle. I ask them whether, if Germany is the great competitor that they recognise, an increase of  10  per cent, on the original duty of  20.  per cent, is a very great thing after all. When we find the woollen and other industries specialized in Victoria, it is indeed singular to find that a New South Wales industry should be picked out for different treatment. All I ask is that the industry should receive, riot such a high protection as was given to Victorian industries, but a slight advance on the old duty. I refuse to act as a phonograph for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale.</inline> I suppose that he has a very good thing in his business, but I am certain that the importers have a better thing in their business. I have read very carefully their letters, and they have not lacked power to put forward the best side of their case. Both importers and manufacturers are pretty good hands at journalistic work ; they excel in the capacity to captivate, the readers of their letters. I am pleased that in this debate we have had so few charges and counter charges as regards the' importers and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale.</inline> I am surprised that such keen business men as the importers and their agents, and the manufacturing firm, have allowed their troubles to be dragged in here and ventilated. I am astounded that they have not arranged their differences outside and come to a compromise. But I am not fighting for the manufacturing firm.  Just as I find honorable members fighting for the interests of their electorates, so I am fighting for the extension' of this industry in my electorate, and I hope that there will be room for competition under this higher duty. The honorable member for Kooyong has said that a person named Wertheim is bursting with anxiety to purchase the business from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale.</inline> Well, there are 3,000  shares still unallotted. I hope that he will rush them. I do not know anything about that company's business, or profess to know anything about the importers, but I do know a little ' about human nature. If this business was such a rattling good thing as has been stated, I do not believe that there would be  3,000  shares standing unallotted  very long. If it was a very good thing, then persons would be 'killed in the crush to secure the shares. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know anything about that ; but, if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wertheim,</inline> of Melbourne, is prepared to take over the business, and is, as has been stated, such a good patriot, he does not need an increased duty. I am surprised that he has not started in the industry long ago. I have discovered that when an importer, especially in Victoria, gets beyond the point of making a certain profit, he devotes himself to manufacturing. I find that in Melbourne, men have been engaged in both importing and manufacturing. They are not out for an airing, but to make money. I believe that the public have obtained a. very good insight into the immense profits which are made out of the piano business. If the importer finds that he is " going under," he will take good care to divert his attention to manufacturing, just as he has done in the woollen, hat, and other industries,, and thousands of distributors will be required. Some honorable members have  Said,  " If you carry an increase of 5 per cent., as against Great  Britain,  and  10  per cent., as against Germany, you will throw thousands of persons out of employment." Let us examine that argument. The only persons who,  so  far as I can see, would be interfered with, are those who canvass for business and collect the instalments on the time-payment system. In any case, those persons would be employed in exactly the same way, and probably additional employment would be given. I have been in public life for many years, but I have never yet gone to a factory in my electorate to talk politics to the employe's. In Victoria, most honorable members, particularly in a campaign, so to large engineering and business establishments, and address the hands. </para>

I have heard them admit that they visited the Melbourne factories, and that, as the result of their visit, they could advise the Committee to impose a higher duty. I have done nothing of that sort. When they have been aiding, rightly or wrongly, very many of the manufacturing industries, I do not see why the piano-making industry should stand out of the scramble. My reason for taking up that attitude is that it is distinctly a New South Wales industry, and, furthermore, it is carried on in my electorate. I would be recreant to my position if I neglected to put forward some claim on its behalf. The employes are well paid, and I want to see the industry enlarged. To those who say that the imposition of a duty will shut out the imported article, I reply, " Then it is not for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale,</inline> but for others." I certainly urge the Treasurer to support duties of  30  and  25  per cent., because, in my judgment, he will not get more protection. That cannot ruin the importer, and it will give encouragement to the existing manufacturer and, I hope, to others to go into the industry. </para>

                        <para>- I regret that the debate could not be carried on without introducing the question of nationality. There has been a continuous reference to " German this" and "German that." I come from a State which contains a large number of German settlers, and I venture to say that every- one who has been there will admit 'that they are as good as any settlers we have. From the remarks of some honorable members, one would think that the whole of this business of importing pianos was a German one, but, as a matter of fact we have received petition after petition from all the States. Honorable members will, perhaps, find the names of two or three persons of German nationality attached to the petition for a reduction of the duties. I do not believe in decrying another man's goods. If I employed men as agents, and heard that they were decrying the goods of my opponent, I would get rid of them at once. There has been too much of that sort of thing going, on here to-day. There has been far too much appealing to prejudice. The Government have submitted a common-sense business proposition, which represents practically a duty of  50  per cent, on the import value of the pianos. I think it was unfair on the part of the Treasurer to quote the very low-valued pianos, and to state that they were coming from Germany, in face of the fact that the Customs returns show that the average price of the pianos imported into this State was  £23  odd, and in the case of New South Wales over  £22. </para>

                        <para>- If one wanted to go into the matter, one could quote an arrangement made, perhaps, at a very low rate. I have it on the best authority that the cost of manufacturing certain pianos, as recorded in the books of the very firm which has been discussed so much, runs from <inline font-style="italic">£16</inline> upwards. But the question is : Is it a fair thing to impose such a high duty as is proposed? I am more concerned about the users than about other persons. It is immaterial to me whether it is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> or the importers who petition the House. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know anything about that. I believe that very nearly one-half of the expenses stated in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale's</inline> balance-sheet each year cover agents' expenses in selling the pianos. But when an importer' delivers directly to a Government he has no expenses to defray other than the home cost and the importing expenses. I am not going to complain about whether the locally-made pianos are good or not. That is all a matter of taste. Every man has has own idea' of what an instrument is. Some people will say that a bagpipe makes beautiful music, but I am not very fond of it. What we ought to do is to give a fair and reasonable amount of protection, recognising that protection is the policy of the country, without putting one firm in a position to secure a monopoly. Probably we could not do better than make some of the intricate parts of pianos free, thus giving a chance to other persons to start in the same business. It would be an intolerable thing if any other person commencing to manufacture pianos had to buy his parts from his opponent. </para>

They are largely made in France and Germany, and even English piano-makers import them. I wish to make it possible for other people to start in this business, and then we shall have that rivalry without which protective duties are so dangerous. Prices will come down as the result of competition. I do not intend to say anything in regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale's</inline> balancesheets and circulars.

                    <para>.- The question at issue is of sufficient importance to the people of Australia to warrant us in eliciting all the opinions that are available from all sides of the Chamber. I do not know that many votes will be altered as a consequence of views that may be expressed, but the expression of them will lead the general public to understand the reasons that have actuated us in fixing these duties, and. will possibly afford an insight into what may be expected in the future. I think that the Treasurer in introducing this matter set a very bad standard for the debate. The question ought to be settled entirely apart from the names of importers. In commenting upon the circular for the contents of which he was, according to his own statement, in no way responsible, the honorable gentleman in my opinion set a  very undesirable example. I have listened carefully to the arguments and facts that have been contributed to the debate, and before proceeding further I can pay this tribute to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> - that in all respects he is conducting his factory in accordance with Australian conditions which do him credit and which are advantageous to those whom he employs. </para>

                        <para>- I am not concerned in what he wants in that respect. Unless Excise conditions are imposed in connexion with these duties I can assure the Government that a considerable time will elapse before they pass this House. I may as well be pretty emphatic on that point. The piano manufacturing industry was established in New South Wales under freetrade. The statistics as to its development afford useful information to honorable members in making up their minds. It appears to me that, established under free-trade conditions, and developed under a protective duty of 20 per cent, under the 1902 Tariff, the industry has made magnificent strides. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> has established himself in every State' in Australia, and- the pianos that he manufactures are four times as many as they were before 1902.  His  pianos have met with a large amount of public approval, as is indicated by the demand for them. Under the old duty; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> has done remarkably well. As to the recommendation of the Tariff Commission, it appears to me that when any manufacturer went before that Commission and asked for an increased duty, the  Chairman  was always prepared to recommend it. He has recommended increases in 99 per cent, of cases where they have been asked for. In this case, although a request has been made for an increased duty,, there does not appear to be any strong justification for it when we consider the facts of the case. But, unfortunately, in a considerable number of other cases increases have been granted where there was not even the same justification for them as there was in this instance. In consideration of that fact, and recognising the general policy that has been adopted by this Committee in favour of increasing duties, I am prepared to vote for an increase of 5 per cent, in the duty against the country which exports nearly all the pianos to Australia at the present time. In the event of this increase being granted, I believe that not only will- the piano-manufacturing industry continue to flourish, but that it will be demonstrated to the music-loving people of Australia that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale's</inline> firm is producing a piano that is capable of giving satisfaction to those who use it. We must not, however, overlook the fact that nearly all the music firms of Australia and a large number of music teachers have been almost unanimous in their condemnation of the increase of the duty. I presume that those people are the best judges of a case of this description. </para>

                        <para>- In deciding as to the future, .we have to be guided by past experience, and the insight which we derive from it. In view of the fact that these protests have been 'made, and on the facts produced. I am not inclined* to vote for a larger increase than 5 per cent, against the principal country from which pianos are imported into Australia. There is no reason to believe that the Australian industry will be prejudiced even if we leave the duty as it stands, but, as increases have been granted upon other items, I shall be prepared to vote for a duty of 25 per cent, on the general Tariff and 20 per cent, against the United Kingdom. I might elaborate other points, but it appears to. me that there is no chance of affecting votes by prolonging the debate, and I think that the best interests of the country will be sewed by concluding the discussion as soon as possible. </para>

But he has furnished the best argument for granting a larger increase than 5 per cent., because he tells us that even under a duty of 20 per cent,  only  one firm of piano manufacturers has been established in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- The fact that only one factory has been established in Australia proves to me that the industry is not sufficiently .protected. There is an enormous demand for pianos, and a.  splendid profit is made out of the trade. I am quite satisfied that if we impose a substantial duty we shall conduce to the establishment of other factories. If any industry should be highly protected, it is that which involves a large expenditure, and consumes a vast quantity of material that can be provided in Australia. </para>

What can be done elsewhere can be done in Australia. I have not heard any one complain of the tone of the Beale pianos.

                    <para>.- Although it is said that pianos are manufactured in Australia, (he veneers, as well as the wire, and many parts of the action used in their construction, are imported. If the public are satisfied to continue to contribute to the establishment of the industry, we may be able, in the course of a century or so, to make complete pianos in the Commonwealth. As a matter of fact, the freights are in favour of the local manufacturer. The duty collected on these instruments in  1906  amounted to  £47,421.  If the duty be increased to  40  per cent., as proposed by the Government, the annual revenue from this source will amount, on the same basis, to  £94,842,  whilst a duty of  30  per cent, would yield a revenue of  £70,931.  This would give us an average yield of about  £82,000  from a duty of  35  per cent. That would be far too much to take out of . the pockets of the people. lt would provide a pension of about  £3  per week for  600  men in the trade. It seems to me that it would pay the Commonwealth, instead of fostering the industry by imposing the duty proposed by the Government, to pension off all the hands in the local factory. The proposal that we should contribute so largely towards the establishment of the industry is little short of disgraceful. Even the old duty of  20  per cent, yielded a revenue that would provide a pension of over £3 per week for  300  persons. In other words, those who purchase imported pianos - and we have to remember that these instruments are often bought with the hard-earned savings of the people - contribute to the revenue a sum equal to the wages paid to those engaged ' in the industry. I do not advocate the free admission of pianos, but I think that it has been clearly shown that the old duty is ample. We have been told that the local manufactory is conducted on splendid lines, that good wages are paid, and reasonable hours observed. If that state of affairs has prevailed under a duty of  20  per cent., why should we increase the duty? I am prepared to vote for duties of  25  , per cent, and  20  per cent., and since the industry is now prospering I do not think that we should go beyond those rates. The fact that the public are paving by wav of duty on pianos a sum sufficient to provide a pension of over  £3  per week for 300 persons in. the industry clearly shows that we are paying too much for sentiment. We have not assisted other industries to the same extent, and I hope that the Committee will reject the Treasurer's proposals. </para>

I have paid careful attention to the arguments of the advocates of the foreign manufacturer, and have glanced  over  the circulars and papers which they have supplied to me; but I knew nothing of the balance-sheet in question until it was referred to in Committee this morning. I and others who have been fighting for Australian industries from the outset were denied an opportunity to examine that balance-sheet. That is not fair play. The importers should have either supplied the same information; to every honorable member or refrained from distributing any, They ought not to have selected a few honorable members to whom to give special information. </para>

                        <para>- Not until it was brought before the Committee this morning; I did not receive a copy of it. When I was seeking information I was told that even if a little more protection were granted it would be utterly impossible to establish the industry in Australia ; but I find that others have received an assurance that the imposition of increased duties will give rise to plenty of local opposition to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale.</inline> I feel Called upon to vote for the highest duty, with0 a view to the establishment of the industry on a firm foundation. " An honorable member who is opposed to the efforts being- made to establish the industry in Australia said he had nothing to say against the quality of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale's</inline> pianos, and I shall not say a word against the imported instrument. I know that many excellent pianos are being imported, but as a protectionist I am confident that the imposition of increased duties will cause foreign manufacturers to commence operations in Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> has not captured the whole market, and there is room for more pianoforte manufacturers in the Commonwealth. .Even if Australian woods are not at present largely used in the local manufacture of pianos, it will be found that we have many timbers which if well dried will be suitable for the purpose. Maryborough pine, as well as Queensland black bean - which is used as a substitute for walnut - red bean and cedar are now being used, and I am proud to know that Lithgow iron is likewise being employed in their manufacture. I would urge my comrades of the Labour Party to remember that this is one of the best industries in Australia. It is at present a New South Wales industry, and I dare say that if these duties be passed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wertheim</inline> will establish a factory in Victoria. I do not wish it to be thought that I am pleading the cause of this industry as a territorial protectionist. I fight for everything that is Australian, and I hope that we shall not lose sight of the fact that splendid wages are paid and reasonable hours are worked in the local factory. </para>

                    <para>.- I have determined to support the imposition of duties of 25 per cent, and 20 per cent, or an increase of 5. per cent, on the old duty. The arguments advanced in support of increased duties have been based on the contention that we have a huge importation of pianos from Germany. If I found that the products of the cheap labour of other countries were being imported so largely as to render it impossible for the local manufacturer to pay reasonable wages and that the industry was languishing. I should consider that a fair case had been made out for additional protection. But when I find that the local manufacturer is doing exceedingly well, and is paying higher wages than are provided for in the award of the Arbitration Court- </para>

                        <para>- That does not follow. I am prepared to give sufficient protection to enable the local manufacturer to pay decent wages to his employes, and derive a fair profit from the industry, but when I have done that, I say that, seeing that the production of the tone of a piano is the work of an artist, I' have no right, by my vote, to prevent the people of Australia from being able to avail themselves of the best that artists can produce in the musical instrument line. The question has been debated at sufficient length,, and I suppose all the evidence that could be submitted on behalf of the importers, as well as of the local manufacturer has been placed before the Committee. I have read all that has been published in connexion with these duties, and have listened to every argument that has been submitted. I think I have given more attention to this item than to any other in the Tariff. I have looked in every corner for information, because I desired to give a conscientious vote upon this item. I believe that an increase of 5 per cent, in the duty under the General Tariff will make up to the local manufacturer for some slight increases in the duties imposed in connexion with other items affecting his industry, will also be to some extent a bar against the importation of German pianos ; will make the duty sufficiently high to enable the local manufacturer to continue his operations profitably, and at the same time give his employes the benefit of fair labour conditions. </para>

                    <para>.- There is no doubt that the paragraph as amended is a little ambiguous. That occurred to me at the time when the question was put ; but if the suggestion I made last night had been followed, grammatically, there could have been no mistake. That was to put in after the word " duty " the words "up to to-day," and then add " and on and after," &amp;c, the rates agreed upon. No doubt the paragraph is ambiguous as it stands, as it is not clear whether the new <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties refer only to the previously proposed  40  per cent, and  30  per cent., or to both the fixed duties and those <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rates. We can clear the matter up in the Tariff Bill, which will be introduced in a few days. That Bill will have to be passed by this House before the Tariff can be sent to the Senate, because we cannot send resolutions up, but must send a Bill. The ambiguity could be easily explained now by a footnote, and, of course, in the meantime the Treasurer would act on the sense of the Committee, which is to collect only the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties. </para>

The matter should not be left in uncertaintv, to be cleared up later on in a Bill. </para>

I was going to move to strike out the fixed duties, but the Committee carried the amendment in the form submitted by the honorable member for Dalley. In order to make the matter absolutely clear, ' the  Chairman  might indicate in some . way, by a footnote or asterisk, what the Committee meant, or allow the Committee to go back in order to strike out the fixed rates. Whichever course the  Chairman  thinks advisable, I shall be glad to adopt.

It is not the expensive class that we have just dealt with. That is evidenced by the fact that the Government originally proposed the much lower specific duty of  £5 10s.,  as against a specific duty of  £16 10s.  on grands and semi-grands. </para>

I hope, therefore, that the honorable ' member will not press his request, because it would be very invidious to make a distinction, and there is no doubt that if I were to reduce the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rates upon these very. cheap pianos it would make them still more liable to be imported. I am proposing the same proportion as was agreed to in the last paragraph. I take it that the decision of the Committee on paragraph a was meant to apply to the whole of this item, and therefore I am moving the duties down to that level. </para>

                        <para>- Not to the same extent, but whether it is worse or better I shall ask the Minister to express his intention now. I shall not be bullied or put off by anybody here. A good deal of claptrap is being talked about people who vote against these duties wishing to strike at Australian industries. I have as much regard for Australian industries as have those who talk in that way - perhaps a little more. There is a good deal of lip service in this chamber, as in other places. I do not think that it is the people who parade their loyalty at all times that are the most loyal. In the same way, those who talk loudest about safeguarding and standing up for Australian industries are perhaps not the people who on all occasions do the most for those industries. I am going to stand here until the Treasurer is prepared to announce what he intends to do about the duty on the outside cases. If he thinks he is going to get this item through without our having some understanding about that matter, he is making a mistake. If the cases are to be taxed, it will mean that instead of agreeing to a duty of 30 per cent, we shall really be sanctioning a duty of 35 per cent. I wish to be courteous to the Treasurer, as I "have been throughout the Tariff, but I think that I am making a fair and reasonable request. He ought to tell us his intention now, because if the duty on the cases is not removed, it will mean a considerable addition to the cost price of importations. In order that the Treasurer may have an opportunity of making an announcement, I will resume my seat. </para>

                    <para>.- The question of outside packages is dealt with in item 444, by which outside packages on fixed duty goods are free, whilst those on <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> goods are dutiable. The general rule in the case of <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> goods is that the basis of valuation shall be the whole of the consignment, that is, the contents as well as the package. But I suggest to the honorable member that the most convenient course would be to deal with this matter when we are on the item of packages generally, and when their treatment may be made uniform. </para>

                    <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline>
                    goods; and there seems to be a good deal of reason for adopting that method. If I were asked the question at the present moment, I should be inclined to stand by the proposal as it is ; and, in any case, the

                        <para>- I am speaking of the old Tariff wherein packages in which goods are ordinarily imported were, when containing such goods, free. There was a special exemption inserted for the purpose, and there ought to be a similar exemption in the present Tariff, because it seems the height of absurdity to impose a duty on packages. </para>

                    <para>. - I should like to point out the difficulty there is in the amendment which has been moved. It seems to me that the only logical and consistent way to deal with this question is under item 444. One of the difficulties of dealing with it now is that, if the proposed amendment be carried, it will necessarily mean that in the case of paragraph  a,  which we have already passed, the outside packages must be taxed. That will not only have the effect of singling out paragraph  b  for special treatment, but will practically mean that two different rates must be charged right throughout the Tariff. We shall expedite business by allowing the whole discussion to take place on item 444; and the fact that the Committee has strongly indicated the opinion that packages should be free, whether the goods be subject to <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> or fixed duties, will be a strong argument against the imposition of such duties. </para>

                    <para>.- When there is an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty, I do not see how honorable members can object to including the cost of the package. . The theory underlying <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties, I understand, is that the value of the goods landed on the wharf in Australia must be the basis of calculation. The value of goods in Timbuctoo or elsewhere, before they are cased and got ready for export, is not the value when they arrive in Australia. Although the principle is that the value of the goods landed in Australia is the value for the purposes of the duty, the Department, for convenience sake, accepts foreign invoices, and imposes an all-round charge for freight and so forth. That plan in some cases works harshly, though in other cases the importers are let off too lightly. When people talk of a duty of 35 per cent, or 20 per cent, they invariably have in their mind the value of the goods when they come into Australia; and, as the goods cannot be brought here without packages, it stands to reason that the value of the packages must be included for the purposes of the Tariff. Only the other day I was talking to a merchant in Sydney in regard to the system of admitting packages containing goods free. He said that while he was disinclined to pay a duty upon packages, the system of levying duty upon them was distinctly in favour of honest trade. He said that there was a disposition on the part of small manufacturers in other portions of the "world to inflate the charge for cases, and to reduce the cost of the goods which they contained. I do not say that a large proportion of outside manufacturers do that, but this merchant assured me that some of them do it. He expressed the opinion that from the stand-point of fair trade, it was better to charge a duty upon the packages. </para>

                <para class="block">But I do not see why we should differentiate between the packages in which pianos are encased and other packages. We have already decided that a specific duty shall be levied upon bottles which are imported full of spirit. The reason why an <inline font-style="italic">ad' valorem</inline> duty was not applied to packages under the old Tariff was that their contents bore a specific duty. In regard to bottles, a difficulty was experienced, because nearly all of them are imported full of spirit. But, in respect of any item which bears an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rate, no difficulty need be experienced. The interjection . of the honorable member for Bass, - who as an importer has a good knowledge of business - to the effect that if we allow any packages to be admitted free, we shall open the door to the possibility of the Customs authorities being deceived, and of the fair trader 'being subjected to unfair competition, has considerable weight with me. </para>

                        <para>- I prefer to accept the statement of men of experience in the importing line, who say that to their knowledge it has been done, to that of the honorable member. The difficulty in regard to piano cases is that persons in other parts of the world place a certain value upon them, and we have no means of checking it. We practically have to accept their statement in the invoice. If honorable members care to run that risk, and to subject the honest trader to a disadvantage, they are entitled to do so. But, in my opinion, it is wise to charge duty upon the cases as well as upon the pianos, even if. bv so doing, we have to accept a lower duty upon the instruments themselves than we should otherwise have to accept. Personally, I should prefer to accept a lower duty upon goods by about 2J per cent., than to exempt packages in respect, of any form of merchandise. The total sum of money paid to the manufacturer should be the basis of the duty charged. </para>

                    <para>.- I should like to add to the testimony which has been given by the honorable member for South Sydney, the evidence of a Customs officer before the Tariff Commission. J sincerely hope that the Government will strenuously resist the amendment of the honorable member for Parramatta, and that it will wipe out the exemption in respect of outside packages in the case of all <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> goods. That exemption has, undoubtedly, been used by unscrupulous persons for the purpose of defrauding the revenue. I do not suggest that particular importers have been guilty of cheating the revenue by inflating the values of cases, but I am satisfied that some of them have done so. </para>

This is a common practice, especially in regard to American goods, and the difficulty is that there is no proper way of checking the value of the cases. </para>

                        <para>- Are they not used as the outside packages for Cadbury's cocoa? The two cases are absolutely parallel. The honorable member for South Sydney has quoted the evidence of an . anonymous witness in regard to this question. But when another honorable member quotes a piece of evidence, he usually wants, not merely the man's name, but his biography, to be supplied. Yet he calmly quotes an anonymous individual, who has evidently cheated the Customs authorities himself, and who, being a thief, imagines that everybody else is a thief. </para>

                        <para>- It is not more violent than the honorable member himself put it when he applied the term "swindlers" to other people. The idea that a Customs officer is unable to assess the value of a piano case is positively absurd. Could he not measure the timber which it contains, and could not any carpenter tell him how long it would take to put the case together ? When a piano has been removed from the case in which it has been imported the case is valueless to the importer. </para>

                        <para>- The importer, who has to pay up to £2 10s. and £3 each for these cases, is obliged to sell them for 5s. or 6s. each to men who retail them to Beale for about 7s. If tanks and casks containing dutiable goods are to be admitted free, I see no justification for refusing to admit piano cases free. Let us know exactly what we are doing. I say that, under the guise of supporting a duty of 30 per cent, we are really being asked to vote for a duty of 35 per cent. </para>

I have no wish to enter into con troversy with him. If he desires that a duty of 35 per cent, shall be imposed, let him say so straight out, and give the Committee an opportunity to vote on the proposal. He has no right to propose a 35 per cent, duty under the guise of a 30 per cent. duty. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that this is a matter which should be discussed in connexion with . item 444, and I shall not detain the Committee long in regard to it. But I have a few remarks to make in reply to the honorable member for Bendigo. He, reading from evidence, stated that there is difficulty in determining the accuracy of valuations of pianos if the outside cases are not' made dutiable,, that the valuations of the cases will be increased and the valuations of the contents reduced. Does any honorable member consider that it is more difficult for the Customs authorities to value a piano <inline font-style="italic">cum</inline> case than to value it <inline font-style="italic">ex</inline> case? </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable member attempted to pass an entry at an under-valuation, he would discover that they do know. They say that they can determine the value of all sorts of complicated imports, and it is absurd to assert that they cannot assess the value of cases much more easily. We have already decided that such outside packages as iron tanks and casks shall be admitted free, and we should not treat wooden piano cases differently. </para>

He assumed that the Customs authorities do not possess the rudimentary knowledge of the man in the street, who would know at once what the value of a piano case was. </para>

                        <para>- Piano cases range in value from  27s.  6d. to  50s.  each, so that there is no margin for defrauding the Customs to any extent. The Department makes elaborate provision for checking the valuations of imports of every description, and yet we are told that its officers cannot value piano cases. Could there be a more absurd proposition ? Piano cases were- free under the old Tariff, and we should make them free under this. </para>

                    <para>.- In my opinion, this matter should be. contested on item 444. I fail to understand by what authority the duty on outside packages is levied. The validity of the collection of the duty may be challenged by certain merchants, not because it is being levied under resolution, but because section 154 of the Customs Act provides for the levying of duties upon goods, which are defined as separate from packages. There is nothing in the Tariff which says " that packages shall be subject to duty; there is only the declaration that outside packages in which goods other than those dutiable <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> are ordinarily imported shall be admitted free. That declaration does not impose a duty on other packages, it being an incontrovertible rule of law that the subject is not to be taxed except by express words. If it is doubtful under which of two headings an article shall be taxed, it is, according to the Customs Act, dutiable at the higher rate. </para>

                        <para>- If they were taxed as wood, the tax would be a ridiculous one, because it would vary in accordance with the value of the contents of the package. There can be no difficulty about valuing outside packages. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smart</inline> says that difficulty as to false values has arisen because the Courts have held that the term f.o.b. in the Customs Act includes the value of the package. But what is to prevent us from saying that in future the value of the package shall not be taken into account? </para>

                        <para>- It may be too late to bring it up on item 444. A duty of 1 6s. 6d. on a piano case cannot be advocated in the interests of local makers. Pianos must be imported in cases, and it will not be argued that cases can be made here and sent to Germany. Therefore, the duty must be regarded merely as an attempt to increase the protection granted to the local manufacturer of pianos.- It might as well have been said that the proposal to take the dutv off casks was an attack on coopers. In my electorate there are very large cooperages, but I did not advocate then that a duty should be placed on casks in order to help the coopers. Now that the duty on pianos has been settled, there will be a rush to take them out of bond, and the cases, which, under normal conditions, can be bought for a few shillings, will be thrown at the Treasurer in about a week. I see no reason to vote for a duty of 30 per cent, on £2 10s., the cost of the case, just as if it were a piano. From a protectionist stand-point, I see no justification for the tax. It is only a roundabout way of increasing the duty on the piano. My high-water mark of protection for pianos was 30 and 25 per cent., according to the country of origin, and I am not going to be seduced into voting for higher protection to piano manufacturers by means of a duty on cases. </para>

                        <para>- In my opinion, the proper course is to deal with this question on item 444. I do not think it is a correct charge to make on the cases. I know that it has been abused, and, although persons who have made that statement have been accused of being thieves, I may tell the Committee that when I commenced business as a young man offers of that description were made to me, but they saw that I was not a man of that kind. I 'knew it was wrong, and, therefore, I did not do what they wished. Yet, because I know that it is done, an honorable member has said that a man who makes a statement of that kind has been a thief, or he would not know that it is done. </para>

                        <para>- I want to have a fair thing done for the piano importers and also the purchasers. It affects them all. When we are proposing to put duties of 30 and 25 per cent, on upright pianos, whv should the Treasurer try by a side-wind to increase the duties to the extent of from 5 to 7½ per cent.? The honorable member for Coolgardie  was  justified in drawing his attention to this important matter. And the honorable member for* Parramatta was justified in moving his amendment. The Treasurer would have facilitated business if he had given the Committee a fairly clear indication as to what he intended to do I think that the whole question should be dealt with on item 444. At the same time, we want the Treasurer to indicate how the cases are  to  be dealt with before we record our votes on this item of pianos. He must see that if he would only give an answer to our inquiries the business would be proceeded with, and a vote taken as quickly as possible. I have no wish to delay business for a moment. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to say a few words before the amendment of the honorable member for Parramatta is withdrawn. I am not going to sit here silently under the taunt that we have been wasting time in discussing this matter. The honorable gentleman who made that interjection is in this chamber so little that he is not in a position to say when the Committee is or is not wasting time. I remind the Committee that a whole dav was practically wasted over the item of printing ink, when, if the Government had understood what they ought to have comprehended,, a small amendment would have solved the whole difficulty. Instead of occupying an hour on the item, as we have over this matter, nearly a whole sitting was wasted. I reiterate that we have no right to impose this high duty by a side-wind. If it is intended to charge 35 per cent., let us have a . proposition to that effect; but if the duty is to be 30 per cent., let it be that rate and no more. The Treasurer knows quite well that, under the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> system, the unfortunate importer pays duty as if the case were part of the piano. He knows further that piano cases are sold in this market at 4s. or 5s. each, although they cost the importer on an average £2 5s. In these circumstances, I think that the proposed charge is hardly fair, and that the Treasurer might have given the Committee a more reassuring declaration as to his intention in regard to this item. </para>

We sat for five minutes longer than we ought to have done, and sat illegally, I am told.

There is no time definitely fixed for the suspension of the sitting to take place. If I so desired I could remain in the chair until 7 o'clock. It is merely a mutual understanding that we suspend the sitting at 6.30 o'clock. Whatever was done after that hour was quite in order. </para>

                    <para>.- This is undoubtedly an important matter, and I wish to remind honorable members that, in the past, the Government, and especially the Treasurer, have repeatedly expressed a willingness to give way when it has been clear that they could not secure what they wanted, but afterwards, at a late hour, when there has been a very sparse attendance of honorable members, and there has been a chance of forcing a thing through, they have changed their tactics. I had some experience of that treatment in connexion with the item relating to ink. I have no hesitation in saying, from my knowledge of the Treasurer, ' that if this matter is left over, at some later sitting, the Opposition will be squeezed out, and the honorable gentleman will . get his own way. We shall find that we cannot get pairs ; we were refused pairs to-day, I understand. </para>

I can quite understand why the Treasurer is refusing to give any indication of his intended action. No doubt, he hopes to get his own way at a late sitting. We have had experience of treatment of that kind, as I know to my cost in relation to the ink business.

                    <para>.- This is avery wise provision to insert, and is similar to that which we have inserted in regard to the importation of vehicles. The Treasurer fears that in the absence of departmental by-laws, pianos might be introduced in sections under this paragraph, and quickly put together, just as parts of vehicles have been imported and assembled. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not think that the insertion of the words " under departmental bylaws " will accomplish the object which the Treasurer has in view. A person might import separate parts in several different shipments, and in that way, bring in, at the lower duty, a complete piano. To avoid that being done, it will be necessary to keep a record of the importations of different firms. </para>

                    <para>.- If the Treasurer desires to encourage the manufacture of musical instruments in the Commonwealth, he should also provide that veneers in the rough should be admitted free. I understand that there is only one veneering machine in Australia. I do not think it is right that people engaged in this industry should have to go to a rival manufacturer to get the veneers they require. </para>

                        <para>- Certain public bodies in Victoria have been importing dredges fox some time past. The Geelong Harbor Trust had a very unhappy experience in the case of two secondhand dredges which they bought at Natal. Unfortunately for those on board, those vessels never reached here. I hope the Treasurer will be able to include dredges in this item, so as to give work for some of our workmen. I hope the honorable member for Dalley will object, on behalf of the ship-builders in his electorate, to the dumping of secondhand boats here. </para>

                    <para>. - The Treasurer, as a protectionist, should be very careful not to give protection to the outside world instead of to his own country. The principal launches imported are motor launches, the building of which is a great speciality in New South Wales. They are made by a firm whose main business is in my electorate, but this work is done by them in the electorates of the honorable members for Parramatta and North Sydney. Although the Treasurer has accepted the suggestion of the honorable member for North Sydney for a preferential rate, I would rather see the duty remain at  20  per cent, all round. </para>

                        <para>- Twenty per cent, means an increase of only  5  per cent, on the duty in the old Tariff. Engine-fittings, which have to be imported for these vessels, are dutiable now at a certain rate, and why should we allow the finished article in the shape of the vessel itself to come in at a lower duty? Even a duty of  20  per cent, is low. </para>

                    <para>. - No case has been made out in favour of this duty. Launches take up a great deal of room on shipboard, the charge for freight is by measurement, and that makes imported launches very expensive. It is to the advantage of Australian builders of launches to have samples occasionally of the best work of the kind from America, where the industry is very advanced. I hope the duty will not be made prohibitive. As the freight is so high, we are not likely to be inundated with imported launches. </para>

                    <para>. - Under the old  15  per cent, duty, only  £1,446  worth of launches were imported last year. During that period, I know that hundreds have been constructed in Australia, a very large number in my electorate. The figures show that there is no danger to the local builders of undue competition from abroad, and in those circumstances the Treasurer could safely take the course to which he assented just now. </para>

                        <para>- What I ask for will be, at any rate, some preference to Great Britain on an item where a preference should be offered. If the Treasurer sees reason to depart from what he said, I am not desirous of holding him to his impetuous statement, but there is no fear of the concession injuring the Australian industrv. This is a special line, which Great Britain can produce, and it looks curious that we should, not give her a preference. </para>

                    <para>. - Will the Treasurer make any proposal on this item to stop the importation of dredges by public bodies? If any one ought to support local industries, the members of public bodies should do so. In Victoria, where the settled policy of the people is protection, a number of men who take public positions on bodies like the Harbor Trust and the Metropolitan Board of Works import all they can when they get the opportunity, especially dredges, which could well come under this item. </para>

                    <para>. - I should like very much to deal with dredges, but I am afraid the debate which would result would be too long. Another important reason why we should hesitate before taking a step of that kind is that the duty would affect public bodies, and raise the question of taxing their importations. I do not think the imposition of a duty of that kind would be very popular with the States. We should not allow that consideration, of course, to be paramount, but I should hesitate before making  at this stage a proposal which would give rise to a long debate, even if we could get it through at all. </para>

                        <para>- I know from the farmers to which firm they give preference, but I am now merely treating the question in a general way. The Treasurer might well ask the Committee, and the Committee might well agree, to impose duties of, say, 15 per cent, and 10 per cent., in order to give the Australian manufacturers some little advantage over their Japanese competitor. It is true that very little of this manure is from Great- Britain, but still a preference might be given in the Tariff.  The Australian manufacturer has to pay Australian rates of wages and observe Australian conditions, and it would only be an act of justice to afford the protection I have suggested. </para>

                    <para>.- These manures were free under the old Tariff, both sections of the Tariff Commission recommended that they should be free, and they appear as free in the Tariff now under discussion. The phosphates, which are the main component, come from Ocean Island, off the north-east coast of Australia, where there is estimated to be something like 12,000,000 tons in natural formation. These phosphates are brought to Australia, and here treated with sulphuric acid, which , is produced from imported sulphur. </para>

                    <para>. - I join with the honorable member for Riverina in asking the Treasurer to put a duty on manures. If I thought that the farmers would be penalized in any way I should not advocate a duty, but the experience in South Australia is quite to the opposite effect. In that State some years ago the whole of the manures used were imported, and the importers, having the field to themselves, charged <inline font-style="italic">£l</inline> per ton. This price was so excessive that the Labour Party urged the State Government to do as had previously been done in the case of wire netting - which,- by the way, was being imported at  £5  or <inline font-style="italic">£6</inline> below the price charged to the farmers - and import a shipment of manures. The importers at once came to the Government and said, " If you will not import manures, we will agree to reduce our prices to <inline font-style="italic">£5</inline> 7s  " ; and from this it will be seen that they had not only been leaving themselves a large margin of profit, but had actually been robbing the farmers. The imported manures were so badly adulterated that, again, Parliament had to step in; and I assisted to pass a Bill in the State Parliament in order to secure the purity of the article. Then it was discovered that there are plenty of phosphates in Australia. Tn addition to the plant mentioned by the honorable member for Riverina, there is one at Port Adelaide; but I am assured that the New South Wales plant, alone is capable, with the local phosphates, of supplying all the manures required in Australia. The price has been reduced to <inline font-style="italic">£4</inline> 5s.  per ton, and that reduction is due entirely to the operation of the local mills. I feel certain that if we destroy the competition caused by the Australian industry we shall revert to' the old conditions. I have no doubt that in some of the States, where there is no preventive legislation, the farmers are suffering from adulteration just as the South Australian farmers suffered. The Treasurer, I think, will admit that it would be only fair to impose a small duty for the encouragement of an industry "capable of supplying the requirements of Australia -at a fair price. </para>

                    <para>. - No one can contend .that these manures cannot be locally produced in sufficient quantities, seeing that there are manufacturers sufficiently numerous to turn out more manures than are required in Australia. In  1902  the price was <inline font-style="italic">£4.</inline> 15s.,  and now it is <inline font-style="italic">£\</inline> 5s.  ; and this is due to the fact that the industry has been started in Australia. The honorable member for Indi, and the honorable member for Grampians, both being Victorian members, know how,- some few years ago, the imported manures were proved to have dropped below the previous standard. Seeing that we can produce a good article, and that our manufacturers have to pay a duty upon their bags- </para>

                    <para>. - I am very much surprised to find some representatives of the poorer States of the Commonwealth advocating a proposal to make manures more expensive. In South Australia the use of concentrating manures has revolutionized the farming industry. I speak of that State specially because it is a lean State notwithstanding that it. covers such a vast area. If millions of tons of manures were accessible to the farmers of South Australia at a cheap rate, it would become one of our greatest States. I have been told that since the farmers there have . been using concentrated manures they have been enabled to make land remunerative which previously would not pay. for ploughing. The effect of imposing a duty upon this item must inevitably be to make manures more expensive. In my opinion they are already expensive enough, seeing that the best kinds range in value up to <inline font-style="italic">£6</inline> and  £7  a ton. We know that in .the past the sale of manures was characterized by a great deal of fraud. But there is fraud in every department of trade. </para>

                        <para>- In the more enlightened States, however, legislation has been enacted under which the purchaser of any manure may have a sample of it analyzed, and if' it is not up to standard the vendor may be punished. To a large extent this legislation has checked the evil which was previously rampant. I need scarcely point out that within thirty miles of Sydney there is to be found land which is not worth 5s. per acre, but which bv the use of manures can be made worth £10 per acre. I shall vote against the proposal to levy a duty upon this commodity, because I know that it would have to be paid by the farmer. </para>

                        <para>- That is what ii means. The imposition of a duty upon manures is advocated only by the representatives of metropolitan constituencies. It is quite true - as has been pointed out by the honorable member for Robertson -that in South Australia we had to enact legislation to prevent the adulteration of manures. But who were the worst offenders in that connexion? Undoubtedly they were some of the local vendors, who were actually digging up soil upon the adjacent islands and selling it as manure. The use of manures has brought under cultivation hundreds of thousands' of acres which were previously regarded as worthless. </para>

                        <para>- My. statement upon a previous occasion - as will be seen by reference to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> - was that during a period of ten years, certain farmers in South Australia had not averaged one bushel of wheat per acre. I further' stated that that wheat had been sold for as low a price as1s. 4d. per bushel, and I know that my assertion is true. Realizing the climatic conditions with which agriculturists have to contend in the arid portions of South Australia, the uncertainty of the seasons, and the fact that they are faced with the vermin pest, I should be recreant to my trust as their representative if I did not oppose the proposal under consideration as long as I had breath in my body. </para>

                        <para>- The cry of the cheap labour of Japan is raised upon every occasion that protectionists desire to levy an import duty. They forget that our farmers have to compete with that cheap labour in the markets of the world. The wheat-growers' market is London, and he has already been sufficiently penalized under  this Tariff. There is no free machinery for the farmer. While the man who has a factory is able to obtain his machinery free in many cases, the farmer gets nothing free. If the Treasurer supports this proposition, he will hear more about the matter. </para>

                    <para>.- There is a misunderstanding as to what has been suggested, the desire of the honorable member for Riverina being to impose a duty, not on manures generally, but on  superphosphates, which are largely worked up in the Commonwealth into a commercial commodity. This duty is asked for because the bags containing the imported superphosphates are imported free of duty, whereas the persons who prepare superphosphates locally have to pay a duty on the bags which they use. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; but labour is much cheaper in Japan. That, although a misfortune to the Japanese people themselves, gives an advantage to the commercial enterprises of the country. I should like to know whether the Minister is prepared to move in this matter. The amount invested in the industry in the Commonwealth is about £1,000,000, while the wages paid, to the men employed in it come to £104,000 a year. </para>

                        <para>- That is a reflection on the' administration of the Customs Department. The -honorable member for Grey has said that the proposed duty will increase the price of manures to the farmers. That is the stock argument of those who are opposed to duties, the legislators who advance it being afraid to move forward. Their policy is one of stagnation and stultification. They fear the consequences of any move forward. We, who advocate the imposition of duties, recognise that there is a certain amount of danger attending it'; but the Government have to-night placed before us the outline of a scheme for protecting the workers and preventing the consumers from being victimized. They are in sympathy with efforts to prevent the incidence of protective duties becoming unduly burdensome. I admit that these duties will not create a paradise of cheapness. But cheapness is not everything. If we could get for nothing everything that we want, we should become effete, and decay. A nation that makes its own goods has a manhood of better type than one which makes no such effort. I urge the Minister to do something in this matter. </para>

                    <para>.- In the district which I represent, the value of the land has, in many places, been increased  threefold by the use of superphosphates. I speak without prejudice in this matter, and only as I am guided by my sense of what ought to be done. There are many large phosphate deposits in South Australia, and, in fact, in my district, and where-ever there is an indication of the presence of superphosphate there are persons ready to enter into agreements with the farmers for the right of mining for it. If I were to study my interests as a member, I might favour a duty on superphosphates, because a good many persons in my district are making these into manure, and the price paid for the raw material depends, not only on its quality, but also upon the price obtained for the manure made from it. Some persons have asked me to support a duty, but I do not feel disposed to do so, especially in view of the splendid results which have followed the use of superphosphates in South Australia. There is practically an unlimited demand for superphosphate manures. </para>

                        <para>- I think that if the importations were stopped, the local production would not meet the demand, so that there is not much fear of injuring those who manufacture superphosphates into manure, if we continue to allow superphosphates to be imported free of duty. I hope that the Government will not add to the burdens of the farmer by imposing a duty on superphosphates. </para>

                        <para>- He said so ; but twenty-eight years ago the price of superphosphates was between £4 and £5 a ton, the price of manures ranging from £4 to £15 a ton, according to quality ; and Peruvian guano selling at £14 10s. a ton. The fluctuations in the price of superphosphates has not been caused by anything that has occurred in South Australia within the last three or four years. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that the farmer should be taxed any more than he is, and I certainly hope the honorable gentleman does not propose to tax his raw material. He must be aware of the value of superphosphate manures to the farmer. He must know that all over Australia tens of thousands of acres, which at one time were considered almost worthless, are now made profitable to the farmer simply by the use of those manures. He has been taught how, by scientific farming, fallowing, and manuring, he can produce payable crops, thus finding employment for men and adding to the wealth of the country. </para>

                    <para>.- It is necessary that I should address the Committee, because it is dealing with a subject in which I am considerably interested, and. I prefer not to vote. I, as an individual, am opposed to any effort to impose a duty on superphosphate manures. I have been requested to state that if the Japanese material continues to be imported, as is proposed, the large works which have been started by the companies in Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide may be closed. </para>

                        <para>- I am in a. position to speak with knowledge and authority. I look at this matter purely from a commercial stand-point. At the present time, fully  1,000  men are employed at the various Works. The Mount Lyell Company are engaged in erecting large works in Adelaide, and have erected in Yarraville large works, which have cost nearly  £90,000.  It must be understood by the Committee that those works must cease operations if there is a large importation of this material at greatly reduced prices. </para>

                        <para>- That is all to the advantage of the farmers. In Victoria there is a very proper Act under which the value of the superphosphates is regulated, and the companies are now supplying to the farmers a manure superior to the imported article. I am vice-chairman of one company ; but the application to the Minister did not originate from that company, but from another direction. I am here to represent my constituents, and not any private interests, and of course it is not my intention to vote on a question in which 1 have so prominent a personal interest. But it seemed desirable that the Committee should understand that the companies have not the slightest intention of increasing the cost to the farmer in any way. Such an idea would not be entertained for a single moment. The companies are prepared to give a five years' guarantee that no increase will be made. </para>

                        <para>- Why should they do that? I think there is some misapprehension as to the method of manufacture. The sulphuric acid is made from pyrites and sulphur, which can be easily obtained in Japan, and is being sent down to Australia in considerable quantities as well as the superphosphates. The original proposal of the Government was  that these manures should be free; but representations have been made to the Treasurer that a labour question is involved, and he has very properly endeavoured to ascertain the feeling of the Committee. He has left himself in the hands of honorable members as to what course should be taken. </para>

                    <para>.- I understand that the position is that the Treasurer has been asked to agree to the imposition of a duty on chemical manures. He has not definitely agreed. He is very properly waiting to ascertain what the num-bers are. It is not often that I venture into the realm of prophecy, but I do venture to say that this question is of such great importance to the material welfare of the Commonwealth that any Government, which proposed to impose a duty which might lead to a considerable increase in the price of what is an absolute necessity to the producers would have a very short life. This is one of the matters which exemplify the great difficulty of arriving at anything like a scientific system of protection. Undoubtedly the men who are engaged in producing chemical manures would, under a strictly scientific protectionist Tariff, be entitled to their modicum of protection. There is no getting away from that argument. But we cannot shut our eyes to the obvious, and it is utterly unreasonable to propose that we should tax a material affecting the well-being of the country in the interests of a comparatively few. It would be absolute suicide to do so. </para>

                        <para>- Is the Treasurer prepared to express an opinion about it ? The question has been raised several times as to whether the imposition of a duty decreases the price of an article. Because the prices of some commodities have been reduced it is argued that that is the result of protection, whereas the reduction of the prices of many articles has been simply due' to the improvement of mechanical contrivances. </para>

Let the honorable member make no mistake about that. The honorable members to whom I have referred have posed as the special friends of the farmer. I challenge both of them to show that they ever did more for the farmer or have enjoyed the farmer's confidence for a longer period than I have. I have had that confidence because I have been a farmer myself. I have been the victim of a monopolistic ring which would crush out the last drop of blood in the shape of money from the producer. </para>

                        <para>- I am utterly at a loss to know what statement I have made to which the honorable member could take exception as being personal. If, in the heat of debate, I have" made a statement to which he objects I unreservedly withdraw it. No one regrets more than I do what has taken place. The honorable member for Grey, I am sure,, will admit that he seems always to throw out a challenge to other representatives of the farmers. I rose only for the purpose of doing what I conceived to be my duty. The honorable member for Grey seems to think that if a duty be imposed upon any article the farmer has to pay for it. I take an entirely different view. I have always held that, if by the imposition of a duty on any articles used by the farmer its local manufacture is stimulated and competition created the farmer is benefited. I have proved that the manufacture of superphosphates in Australia has resulted within the last five years in the farmer securing them at 35s. per ton less than he had to pay before. I feel, however, that if we allow things to remain as they are, the  800  men now engaged in the industry in Australia will be driven out of it. Over  £1,000,000  has been invested in the industry in three of the States, and last year  £100,000  was paid in wages. By penalizing the men employed in the industry we shall take money out of their pockets and put it in the pockets of the importers. The object of free-trade is to pl ace every one on even terms. It was proposed, not merely that -the Australian manufacturer should compete openly with the foreign manufacturer, but that he should be under penalties in having to pay higher rates of wages, and work under disabilities which did not affect his foreign competitor. Honorable members opposite go further, and say that the article which he requires as a package for the product he manufactures must pay a duty, whilst they are prepared to allow the "manure and the package in which it is contained to be imported free from Japan. Honorable members cannot deny that the effect of Internal competition in this instance has had. the result of reducing the price of the article to the farmer from £6 to £4 5s. per ton. </para>

My only interest in this matter is to benefit the farmer by keeping local competitors in the field against' the imports of the foreign article. I should be blind to his interests if I gave a vote which would have the effect of increasing the price of the article. When competition in the production of any article is removed, the price is increased to the consumer, and if it is maintained the price is kept at a fair level. </para>

                        <para>- And as the farmers' friend. I have represented farmers for the last twenty-three years in the Parliament of New South Wales and the Commonwealth Parliament. In spite of the efforts of honorable members opposite, with thousands of pounds behind them ito prevent my return, the farmers have remained true to me. This is not merely a matter of theory with me.   I  was' farming years ago before the establishment of the manufacturing industries, brought into being by the protective Tariff of Victoria,' and for the implements I used I had to pay  100  per cent, more than the price for which they can now be obtained in the Commonwealth. I admit the value of manures and superphosphates, and wherever I go I recommend their use to the farmers. I need not mention names, but I am aware that time after time, by analysis, farmers have discovered' that they have been imposed upon with rubbish in the shape of imported manures, and might just as well have put sand into the soil. Where the manufacture is carried out under local legislation and supervision, the farmer knows that he can get a pure article, which will increase his crop. He wishes that the Australian manufacturer of manure shall continue in existence, and if he were a member of this Committee he would' be found assisting the Australian manufacturer to continue his competition against the foreign manufacturers of manures. If honorable members have made up their minds to protect the foreigner, the responsibility is theirs, and not mine. I have pointed out the position, but honorable members opposite, true to their policy, propose to penalize the Australian farmers and protect their " brother Jap." </para>

                        <para>- Then that  10,000  tons has to come off. But, taking  30,000  tons  as the production of the  £100,000  -plant, and allowing, say,, twice as much as the value of the plant for the whole of the rest of the .production, that would give  £300,000,  and, adding  £90,000  for the works of the Mount Lyell; Company, as stated by the honorable member for Kooyong, we get a total- of  £390,000,  or, say,  £400,000.  That is giving an outside estimate. Therefore the statement that  £1,000,000  is invested in plant and buildings in this country is much beyond the mark. </para>

                        <para>- We have heard a good deal about . imports, and about the destruction that Japan was causing in this industry. The honorable member for Corio asked me if there were imports from anywhere else but Japan. In 1906, according to the Commonwealth. Statistician, we imported of superphosphates £110,722 worth from the United Kingdom, £33,070 worth from Belgium, £3 worth from France, £13,739 worth from Germany, £12,116 worth from the Netherlands, £74 worth" from the United States of America, and £790 worth from Japan. That shows that our imports' from other countries have been much larger than from Japan. </para>

                        <para>- That is a reason why no duty should be imposed. Phosphate rock is the raw material. Neither the Minister nor the honorable member for Riverina proposes a duty on it. The phosphate rock is taken from those islands not only by Australia but by Japan. It has to go up to Japan, and then to be brought back again after being manufactured. There is a tremendous natural protection in that alone, and the effect is shown by the small quantity of imports last year from Japan. It is also stated in the sworn evidence of one of the witnesses that thirty years ago he sold superphosphate at about the same rate - £4 5s. It is now a little more - I think about £4 7s. 6d. I do not wish to delay- the Committee, but the Government are forcing a discussion. I have a great deal more than this to say, but I should like to know from the Minister- </para>

As to the bags, the duty can only apply to a special sort, the great bulk of the manures being put up in ordinary bags which come in free. I pointed out at the time that it was not fair to single out manure bags for duty. However, the position is so manifest that the trouble. can easily be remedied in another place. </para>

                        <para>- I am sorry to hear that interjection from an honorable member who professes to be a protectionist. Like the honorable member for Grey, I am speaking for those I represent, and in my electorate, there are two very large manure factories, together with two or three smaller ones. In spite of the fact that the local industry has brought down prices, we have honorable members who are wedded to free-trade refusing to give a chance of employment, and doing what they can to stop the development of manufactures in Australia. If the farmers' representatives could see as far as the ends of their noses-, they would realize that if the local industry be crushed, the importers will at once raise prices. Here we have an industry that has not been fostered, at any rate, by the Commonwealth Parliament. We have been told by the honorable member for North Sydney that there is not  £1,000,000  invested in the industry, and he has supported his statement with extracts from the evidence taken before the Tariff Commission. The honorable member forgets, however, that that evidence only related to the actual factories, and that, apart from the factories themselves, there is subsidiary employment, such as is afforded in bringing the material from Tasmania and other places. I should say that in reality there is more than  £1,000,000  invested in the industry taken as a whole. I am determined to see that the honorable member for Grey, in his blindness, does not damn and starve  500  or  600  men with their families in my electorate; and I appeal to protectionists to support me. Of course, I do not expect support from honorable members who were returned in other States as protectionists, but who, when an opportunity is presented to foster industries in a way that would do the farmers no. harm, trot out all sorts of evidence they know is not correct. Never yet has an attempt been made to impose a duty on a manufactured commodity, but honorable members have voted against it because it did not in any way benefit their own electorates. I am not surprised at free-traders voting against such duties; but when we have the honorable member for Boothby, who calls himself a protectionist, but who never casts a protectionist vote except for the benefit of his own electorate </para>

                    <para>-  After the wild attack made upon me by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, may I say that I do not think that in my electorate there is a single manufacturer of any dutiable articles? When the honorable member accuses me of voting for protectionist duties only when my own electorate is interested, he is very much " at sea." May I say that some ten years ago I assisted considerably for two or three years in developing the manure industry in Australia.I took action in the direction of securing the payment of a bounty for the discovery of phosphatic rock. No reason has been assigned for the imposition of a duty upon manures. No request has been made by those interested in the industry, and the fact that they did not take the trouble to appear before the Tariff Commission is pretty conclusive evidence that it is not in need of any adventitious aid. The fact is that for some years after the introduction of mineral manures into Australia the entire trade was in the hands of the foreigner. But with the establishment of the local industry, Australian manures have superseded imported manures. </para>

                        <para>- It seems to me that when an honorable member proposes the imposition of a duty upon an article which appears in the free list, it is the business of the Treasurer to explain to the Committee the attitude of the Government towards it. Certainly such a course of action would tend to curtail debate. I see no reason why a duty should be levied upon manures. The local article is superseding the foreign article- </para>

                        <para>- One of the difficulties surrounding the present position is that the local manufacturers have to pay a duty upon their bags. When I pleaded that jute, manure; and gypsum bags were not made in Australia, and therefore ought to be admitted free what was the position taken up by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports ? Was he a supporter of this industry? Certainly not. He voted for the duty. I have no desire to labour this question. If the Government had chosen to give an early " lead " in this matter I am satisfied that the debate would have been very much curtailed. Even now, if the Treasurer will declare that they do not intend to support the proposal of the honorable member for Riverina, there will be no need to prolong discussion. </para>

                    <para>.- I asked the Treasurer, an hour and a half ago, if he intended to impose a duty on superphosphates. That is a matter of vital importance to South Australia, whose output of wheat is trebled since superphosphates came into use. The honorable member for Riverina, whose own district is suffering so much this year, should be glad that we are having a good season. He said that the honorable member for Grey did not know what the farmers want, but no man in Australia knows more about the needs of the farming community than does the honorable member for Grey. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot say everything at once. I can only utter one word at a time. Fishing nets are not made in Australia, because the demand is not sufficient to justify the cost of erecting the large machines which are essential to their manufacture. It is intended to substitute fishing net for the galvanized wire-netting which is now used to form the races to rabbit-traps. There is a patent for using fishing net for that purpose. If fishing net is made free, and it was known that it was intended to be used for rabbit trapping, the Customs officers might say that, inasmuch as it was not to be used for fishing it was dutiable. </para>

                    <para>. - I never like to be petulant. When protectionists endeavour to save an industry from being wiped out, 'honorable members on the other side get up and say that our amendment has been sprung on the Committee, and all sorts of insinuations are thrown out. My advice to the Treasurer is to beware of every suggestion which comes from the other side. When they want to alter or lower a duty, everything is supposed to be right and proper, but when we want to make an alteration, we are accused of underground engineering. We on this side, ought to give the members of the Opposition a dose of their own medicine. Whenever we endeavour to make an alteration which would be beneficial to those carrying on manufactures, we are opposed by members of the Opposition, and our actions are misconstrued. I hope that, until the Tariff is disposed of, the Treasurer will not accept any amendment from that source. </para>

                <para>I have had samples sent to me showing that there is an industry of an important character for the manufacture of cotton yarn in Queensland. I was very much surprised to find to what an extent it is being manufactured. That is why I propose to give the industry some amount of protection, without which it cannot be successfully carried on. </para>

                        <para>- A duty of  15  per cent. on cotton yarn must affect a number of industries, and before asking the Committee to impose it the Government should have satisfied themselves that cotton yarn is being spun in Australia. I feel some anxiety in this regard, because cotton yarn is one of the raw materials of the woollen mills of Victoria. During the debate on the woollen items evidence was adduced that the woollen mills, more particularly  in  this State, largely import cotton yarn. The imposition of this duty may therefore seriously affect the woollen industry. The honorable member for Fremantle mentioned that the value of our imports of cotton yarn amounted in one year to over £70,000. Nearly the whole of that  importation  was consumed in Victoria. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I am sure that the honorable member for Bass will sympathize with my object, because the Tasmanian woollen mills turn out a pure article. I should like to know how many hands are employed in spinning cotton in Queensland. The imposition of this duty may throw out of employment hundreds of men who are now engaged in the woollen industry. We cannot get away from the evidence that cotton is the principal raw material of some of the Victorian woollen mills. </para>

The manufacturers of this cotton yarn are getting improved machinery, and as we have removed the duty that was imposed under the old Tariff on cotton piece goods, they might as well close their mills if we do not give them some assistance in the production of yarn. They had invested a good deal of money, and were manufacturing calico and other cotton piece goods of that kind, and the removal of the duty on cotton piece goods hit them very hard. </para>

They are devoting their attention now particularly to the development of the manufacture of these yarns, and I think it reasonable that they should be given some support. They have arranged for the planting of  200  or  300  acres of cotton from which to draw their supplies, and 1 believe some of the land has already been planted. </para>

                    (Brisbane) [12.59 a.m.]. - I wish to assure the  deputy  leader of the Opposition that the proposed duty on cotton yarn cannot possibly affect the importation of cotton piece goods. As cotton piece goods are allowed in free, the Ipswich mill, which is the only mill of its kind in Australia, will have to be dismantled so far as the machinery for the production of cotton piece goods is concerned. These yarns, the manager of the mill has explained to me, are used, as the honorable member for Grey has said, in the production of goods which are alleged to be all wool.

                <para>Colonel FOXTON.- That is so, perhaps, and if this cotton yarn is not produced here, it must be imported for the purpose. I fail to see why, when woollens have been so highly protected, the manufacturers of woollen goods should not be asked to pay a little extra for a small proportion of the raw material they require, which is the product of another industry indigenous to the country. </para>

                    (Yarra) [1.0 a.m.).Under paragraph d, yarns n.e.i., including hose yarn, are dutiable at 5 per cent. and free. If by that means hosiery manufacturers can get their cotton yarns in free, the difficulty will be got over. But if they have to pay 15 per cent. for any yarns they import, until the. Ipswich mill is ready to supply them, they will be in a worse position than the spinners of the yarn are in. The latter will get a protection of 15 per cent. and 10 per cent., while the manufacturers of hosiery- the made-up article - will get only 25 per cent. and 20 per cent., which will mean only a 10 per cent. margin, if they start on cotton hosiery.

The Government propose to give a bounty for the production of flax, jute, hemp, and kindred plants, and we might reasonably accept what, after all, is not a high duty. I have received a circular from a number of manufacturers who, I think, should have that measure of support. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not object to the duty. I only wish to see what its incidence will be in relation to the huge import of £3,000,000 or £4,000,000 worth of cotton piece goods. If this yarn is merely to mix with wool in the woollen mills, then, as those mills have a high protective duty, they cannot well object to a small rate on the cotton yarn. </para>

                        <para>- There is a little. For certain purposes, cork's have to be cut, and this provides a certain amount of employment. It did so prior to the introduction of this Tariff. But any industry created under this sixpenny duty would be unprofitable alike to the users of the cork and to the community. It is infinitely better that the corks should be cut in the country of origin. Even if a duty be levied upon this commodity, the bulk of the corks used in Australia will be imported. The proposal of the Government simply represents an endeavour to provide employment which, will have to be paid for by the consumers. At one time, there was a considerable duty upon corks operative in Victoria, and yet the amount of cutting done locally was exceedingly small. I quite agree that cork trees can be grown within the Commonwealth. As a matter of fact, I have urged, in another Parliament, that attention should be given to the production of these trees. But I would point out that twenty-five or thirty years must elapse before their bark would be useful for cork making, and that in the interim - if we adopt the Government proposal - we should be levying a heavy tax upon the users of this article. </para>

                    <para>. - If we cannot obtain the duties proposed by the Government, I should like to see slightly decreased rates levied. I would point out that soda-water corks are imported for1s.  6d.  per gross, and that a gross would weigh about  1  lb. The corks for lemonade bottles cost from  8d.  to 10d. per lb., whilst the corks for hop beer bottles cost from  6d.  to  7d.  per lb. Ginger beer bottle corks cost from  5d.  to  6d.  per lb. It will be seen, therefore, that the duties proposed are a little too high. If the Government cannot carry the proposals in the schedule, I suggest that they should accept a duty of  6d.  per lb. upon small corks, and of  3d.  per lb. upon corks n.e.i. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member for Melbourne has quoted from a letter forwarded to him by the Aerated Waters Association of Victoria. They say that fewer than twenty persons are employed in the industry, and that they were employed when there was no duty ; whereas there are thousands connected with the manufacture of aerated water and kindred trades. I understand that the Minister desires to propose a. duty of  35  per cent., which he says is a little less than1s. per lb., which amounts to a duty of from  40  to  50  per cent. on soda-water corks, of from  60  to  70  per cent. on lemonade bottle corks, of from  70  to  90  per cent. on hop-beer bottle corks, and of from  60  to  80  per cent. on ginger beer bottle corks. We do not produce corks in this country, and, according to experts, we could not in any case produce them within less than twenty to forty years. Although they have tried to produce corks commercially in America they have not succeeded. The corks supplied to the world come from Spain and the south of France. Under these circumstances a duty on corks is absurd, and I shall vote for the amendment. </para>

Cork can be grown here, but not in commercial quantities. Therefore the proposed duty is unreasonable, and I hope that the Minister will not insist on it. </para>

                    <para>. - I should like to hear from the Treasurer some reason for his proposed departure from the recommendation of the A section of the Tariff Commission in regard to cartridges. The Commission evidently went fully into the question, because they have made a recommendation in regard to  the  preferential duty, which they have rarely done in regard to any other item in the Tariff. If the Treasurer has any reason why we should depart from that recommendation I should be glad to hear it. Otherwise I shall vote for duties of  20  per cent. and  1 5  per cent. </para>

                    <para>. - I was talking a few days ago to a cartridge manufacturer in Sydney. He told me that if duties of  20  per cent. and  15  per cent. were adopted as recommended by the A section of the Tariff Commission whilst the parts were made free he would be able to get along very well. We ought to have an explanation why the Commission's recommendation has not been adhered to. </para>

                    <para>.Under the Kingston Tariff it was originally proposed to make the duty on cartridges  20  per cent., but Parliament made them free. There was no preference idea in those days. Now, however, the Government profess to be anxious to grant a preference to the United Kingdom. I am quite prepared to vote with the Government in favour of a duty of  20  per cent. against the world in general with a preference to the United Kingdom. That ought to be sufficient. </para>

                    <para>- This item constitutes another tax upon the mining community. I consider that safety fuse at all events should he free. It was free under the old Tariff. I have received a communication which indicates the position. There are only two factories in Victoria which make fuse, one at Footscray and the other at Bendigo ; and only about thirty-three people, mostly girls, are employed. The duty will mean taxation amounting to something like  £8,000  per annum, and for the sake of an industry employing thirty hands the Government propose to subject the mining industry to still another disability.

                    <para>. - This paragraph, although not of great importance, so far as the value of the industry to which it relates is concerned, is of serious consequence to those engaged in mining. There is probably no item in the Tariff to which we should give more careful consideration than one relating to fuse for underground mining. We all know of the perils of the mining industry, and, unhappily, are familiar with the fatalities associated with it. A restriction of the choice of fuses may possibly jeopardize the lives of many miners, and, for that reason, we should give special attention to this question. The evidence seems to indicate that fairly satisfactory fuse has been produced in Australia; but the imposition of this duty has enabled the local manufacturers to unduly penalize the mining industry. I would suggest to the Treasurer that he would save time by agreeing to reduce the duties to¾d. and½d. per coil. </para>

                        <para>- If the Minister has given way to the request made by the honorable member for Kalgoorlie, he is not doing justice to the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission, whose recommendations I am here to sustain. I am sorry that I agreed to help the Government to carry on late to-night if, as the result of late sittings, duties are to be reduced, without fair consideration, by the consent of the Treasurer. Quite a number of honorable members are prepared to support the recommendation of the Commission and the duties originally proposed. I protest against the action of the Treasurer in giving way as he has done. The manufacture of fuse was exhaustively inquired into by the Commission, the protectionist section of which recommended a duty of 1d. per coil. The Government went one step further, and proposed duties of1¼d. and1d. The evidence before the Commission showed that the abolition of the Victorian duty placed the production of fuse in Australia in a very precarious position, and that but for the appointment of the Commission to inquire into the condition of threatened and strangled industries, the factories in Australia would have been closed. </para>

The Commission was positively assured that the local factories had been struggling and fighting a big trust, in the shape of Nobel and Company, which has thrown down the gauntlet, and has deliberately told the Australian manufacturers that it intends to have the whole of the Australian market or nothing. They have cut prices so low that the local factories have been unable to make the business pay. </para>

                        <para>- When the old Victorian duty was abolished Messrs. Nobel and Company reduced prices to such an extent that the local factories had to sell below the cost of production. Their representatives candidly admitted that they desired a duty to enable them to carry on their business. They frankly said that if the importers raised their prices to the extent of the duty imposed they would also be forced to do so, but that otherwise they would be unable to do so. The inference is irresistible that the importing firms first raised their prices and that the local manufacturers did likewise. After all, if they did they merely brought up the price to the normal level at which the local manufacturers were able to make both ends meet, whilst the Victorian Tariff was in operation. I would remind honorable members in the Labour Party that the two factories in Victoria are carried on under the Wages Board system, and are subject to periodical inspection by factory inspectors. They provide excellent accommodation for their employes, and extend to them the very best treatment. It is stated that they recognise the eight hours' system and pay good wages. The rates of wages paid here are much higher than those prevailing in England and on the Continent. We cannot expect the production of fuse any more than the production of any other commodity in Australia under Australian conditions to be as cheap as it is in England or on the Continent. If there has been a slight increase in the price - which I do not admit - it maybe justified by the fact that the local factories have to comply with the strict conditions imposed by the State industrial laws. For the safe conduct of mining operations, there can be no doubt that it is necessary that the best fuse should be used. I have in my hand a report from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hake,</inline> the Chief Inspector of Explosives in Victoria, which was furnished to me specially, in order that I might read it to the Committee when this item came up for discussion. Amongst other things, he says - </para>

                        <para>- It is an argument in favour of its production in Victoria, where it can be transferred to other parts of the Commonwealth within a very short time after it has been manufactured, as against the importation of fuse manufactured abroad. Another argument used by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hake</inline> is that the production of fuse should be promoted as one of the elements and features of national defence, because, in all probability, on the outbreak of hostilities, fuse would be declared contraband of war, and oversea supplies would be liable to seizure. I use that as an argument to show that  we should not allow these local fuse factories to be wiped out. The Tariff Commission had the assurance of the representative of the Bendigo factory, in which over  £20,000  has been spent, that unless this duty were imposed in order to level up prices, the factory would have to be closed, and all the hands turned adrift. </para>

I shall think it very unfair if protectionist members of the Committee vote against this duty. As regards the price of fuse, I venture to say that if the local fuse factories were closed up, as I have every reason to believe they would be, as a result of the rejection of this duty, Nobel and Company, and. the continental fuse-makers, having a monopoly of the market, would charge the mining companies what they thought fit for their fuse, and the price, instead of being reduced, would go up. I say that since fuse has been manufactured in Australia the average price has gone down, and the mining community has ha9 the benefit of a better, as well as of a cheaper, fuse. </para>

                        <para>- Under the Victorian Tariff the duty was id. per coil. The Kingston Tariff when first introduced contained a proposal for the same duty. I think it would mean an increase of about  20  per cent. If this small duty is not agreed to for the protection "of an industry in which over  £20,000  has been expended on one factory at Bendigo and over  £10,000  on another at Footscray, the probability is that those factories will be closed up, and the mining companies must take the consequences. I appeal to protectionists in the Committee not to desert me on this item. I. can appeal to labour members especially to support an industry which pays the very best wages. On this subject I can quote from the report sent to me by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hake,</inline> who visited the Bendigo factory. He says - </para>

                    <para>I found on my first inspection that the factory was established on the right lines, and carefully conducted from the point of view of safety to the workpeople engaged in the factory. Improvements in the factory for the better safety of the workpeople have been gradually extended since 1890. Many of these, although not required under the Act, have been carried out by the proprietor on his own initiative and at his cost. In my opinion, the factory compares favorably with any fuse factory in the world both as regards precautions taken to prevent accidents and the general efficiency of the machinery. </para>

Since its establishment Nobel and Company have appeared in the field in competition with the local factories, and they have proclaimed their deliberate design and intention to acquire a monopoly of the market for fuse in Australia. I warn the Committee, and mining members especially, that if this duty is reduced the disaster caused by the closing up of .the local factory will overtake "them, and they will regret the day they voted against the proposal I make. </para>

I must say that I was not aware of what he has said with respect .to Nobel and Company, nor was I aware that there was a fuse factory in his own constituency. I thought that the duty proposed was rather high. I find that, as the honorable member for Bendigo has said, the duty under the Victorian Tariff was id. per coil. of 24 feet. In Queensland, New South Wales, and South Australia, fuse was free. In Tasmania there was a duty of 20 per cent, imposed, and in Western Australia the article was free. </para>

                        <para>- I had no information at all from the honorable member in regard to the matter. After looking at the duties imposed under the States Tariffs, I thought that the duty proposed was a high duty. It may be that present conditions are different from those which existed when the States Tariffs were in operation, but I do not think the honorable member for Bendigo has been quite fair in blaming me for agreeing to a proposal which seemed to me to be a reasonable one. I was informed some hours ago that there would be a fight over the duty on fuse. </para>

                    <para>. There are many sides to this question, and the honorable member for Bendigo has made a great mistake in stating the case as he has done. This duty strikes a heavy blow at the mining industry. During 1906 1,214,206 coils of fuse were imported into Australia. A duty of1d. per coil on that would have amounted to £5,000. The Tariff Commission actually recommended a duty on powder and tape, which are the principal raw materials from which fuse is made. </para>

                        <para>- There is no consistency in that attitude. If the Commission had recommended free powder to make cheap fuse, there would have been some sense in it. But I fail to see how the Commission could recommend a duty on powder and then expect the mining industry to get cheap fuse. Fuse of the very best qualify is essential for mining. The chief mining of Australia is not carried on in Victoria, but in the other States. Why should we in other States be taxed so that a little fuse can be made in Victoria? The proposition which the Treasurer has accepted is sensible, and, in the best interests of Australian mining, although, perhaps, not altogether of Victoria, but we are here to legislate for Australia, and not for any particular State. </para>

                    <para>.- This is not a South Australian industry; but I am entirely in accord with the honorable member for Bendigo. I am surprised that the Minister has agreed to such a reduction. It is strange that honorable members calling themselves protectionists should be so anxious to destroy one of the best paid industries that we have. The honorable member for Fremantle said that the duty on the total imports last year would have meant , £5,000. The object of the Tariff is to allow people to escape the duty by purchasing the local article. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Bendigo explained how that happened. The Nobel Company has only been doing what has been done in many other cases - dumping and undercutting, in order to destroy the local industry, to secure the whole field to itself, and then put the price up to a much higher figure. If any honorable member can show that it is dangerous to use the fuse made by these two Australian factories, it will be an argument for reducing the duty. </para>

                        <para>- If we are able to make good fuse, as the honorable member says, the people of Australia ought to use that and no other. This is a well-paid industry. We have had too few of that kind, a large number paying good wages only under compulsion. I am prepared to give a fair measure of protection to every well-paid industry. The Minister said that he gave way because there were no duties in the States, except in Victoria, and Tasmania. That is no argument at all. The reason that there was no duty in any of the other States except those named was that an impost would have been a handicap to the miners in those States. Under the circumstances, it was thought better to leave fuse free, so as to bring it into competition with the fuse made in the Old Country. I am prepared to support the honorable member for Bendigo; and I hope every good protectionist will do the same. I have, without any protest, agreed to reductions that I thought altogether unjustifiable, in view of  the evidence given before the Tariff Commission ; but this is a reduction to which I cannot consent. I hope the honorable member for Bendigo will adhere to the duties proposed in the Tariff. </para>

On the other hand, when the honorable member for Kalgoorlie made a request, the Treasurer, in order to save time and himself some trouble, at once agreed to reduce the duty ; and, in view of the fact that the honorable gentleman did this without knowing anything of the Victorian industry, he deserves some blame. </para>

                        <para>- In this case, I think the Minister is rightly blamed. When we ask the reason for the Minister's attitude, we find that he has ascertained that before Federation, Victoria was practically the only Colony in which there was protection in this connexion. It was because of that protection that Victoria was the only Colony in which there was a fuse factory ; and I am glad that the honorable member for Bendigo intends to divide the Committee on the question. We ought to remember that the wages paid in this industry in Victoria are double those paid in England ; and that in itself is sufficient justification for a duty. Any one who knows the methods of importers, and especially the Nobel Company, realize that, if the Victorian industry were extinguished, the mining industry, instead of gaining, would lose, because prices would be at once raised, with a view to wiping off the losses caused by the local competition. The miners of Ballarat, Bendigo, Blackwood, and other places are only too glad to have this Victorian factory in operation, because it means to them better and cheaper fuse. As a matter of fact, this Australian industry, by means of its safer product, is a protection to the Australian miner; and it is most unfortunate that the Minister should agree so readily to a suggestion which may lead to its extinction. I trust that the honorable gentleman will be convinced by the arguments of the honorable member for Bendigo, and, at least, agree to duties of 1½d. and1d. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. FRAZER</inline> (Kalgoorlie) [2.36 a.m.]. - I am surprised at the debate which has followed the attempt of the Treasurer to do what is fair in reference to this item; also at the opinion which has been expressed that the extinction of the industry will follow a reduction of the duty. When this item was discussed on the passing of the last Tariff, Parliament distinctly refused to make this article dutiable; but the result has not been the wiping out of the industry. </para>

                        <para>- If this is one of the well-paid industries of the Commonwealth, the Lord save us from the poorly-paid industries. In order to encourage the manufacture of fuse, it is proposed to levy a tax of £6,000 per annum upon the mining industry, which does , pay decent wages to men. I find that there are fifty-nine males employed in the fuse industry at an average wage of 38s. id. weekly. The wages of the females in the industry range from 9$. 6d. to 16s. 8d. Altogether, there are 171 hands engaged, at an average wage of £1 os. 8d. per week. I hold in my hand communications from the Secretary of the Miners' Union of Western Australia, and from the Chamber of Mines there, to the effect that, taking advantage of the increased duty proposed, Messrs. Bickford and Smith, of Bendigo, immediately increased the price of the locally-manufactured fuse from 4s. 6d. to 6s. per dozen coils. </para>

                        <para>- The production of fuse is a Victorian industry. It was established here in 1871, when a 20 per cent, duty was operative. Before long, however, it was found necessary to substitute a specific duty of id. per coil. What did the foreign manufacturer do? He clumped his inferior fuse into this State to such an extent that the Government found it necessary to increase the duty to rid. per coil. I should like honorable members to recall the number of accidents which resulted from the use of imported fuse at the period of which I am speaking. When the industry was first established in Victoria, the price of fuse was is. pen coil, but it has since been reduced to 7d. per coil. A little while ago, tenders were called for the supply of fuse to the Broken Hill mines. What happened? Although the price of the imported article was 8s. 6d. per dozen coils, a firm at Footscray which tendered to supply the fuse at 6s. 4d. per dozen coils was beaten by an importing firm which desired to get hold of the market. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know. In Ger.many the duty upon fuse is is. 4d. per dozen coils, and in the United States it is 30 per cent. I regret that the Treasurer should have practically agreed to take off the duty proposed the moment he was approached by a free-trader in the person of the honorable member for Nepean. The honorable member for Kalgoorlie then moved a reduction of the duty by 100 per cent., and the Treasurer consented to accept his proposal without even putting up a fight. I do not intend to allow any Australian industry to -be wiped out if I can prevent it, and if the honorable member for Bendigo divides the Committee upon- this question I shall be found supporting him. </para>

                        <para>- If he .had told us that I should not have complained. With regard to the item itself, I remember the discussion in the Victorian' Assembly in 1895, when a duty was agreed to which allowed the manufacture of fuse to be successfully carried on in this State. Until fuse was manufactured here, mining was carried on in many districts at great risk, and there are men who to-day bear the marks of wounds received from the use of faulty fuse. Those who have been associated with mining' districts, as I have been from my birth, must have been struck with the immunity from disaster of recent times compared with the frequency of accidents in the old days. Nothing gives a greater shock to the community than a large mining accident. To-day is the twenty-fifth anniversary of the greatest mining calamity that we have had in Victoria - that which took place at the Australasian Mine, Creswick. I am firmly convinced, of my own knowledge, that what has been said as to the probable effect of the reduction of the duty in closing the works, <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> which fuse is made locally is absolutely correct. As a corollary there will be an increase in the price of fuse. Those who pose as the friend of the miner, and wish to lessen the chances of accidents, will find that they have been sharpening a swore? against themselves, and placing the industry in the hands of that great monopoly, the Nobel Company. Honorable members seem disposed to give a certain amount of -encouragement to the mining industry, but in this instance they are grasping at the shadow and losing the substance. I would remind those who seem to have forgotten their protectionist principles that the way to keep down prices is to stimulate healthy competition. Without competition there must be monopolies, combinations and rings for the plundering of the consumer. Those who wish to assist the mining industry by giving a cheap fuse, and to maintain a subsidiary industry, will vote for a reasonable duty on this item. By doing so they will make the miners and timber getters of the country, who desire cheap fuse, independent of makers on the other side of the world who in the past have not been considerate of their wants. </para>

                    <para>.It is only fair to say that the Treasurer agreed to duties of fd. and Jd. because he felt that, if he did not, the item would be -made free. I am anxious that the making of safety fuses should be carried on in Australia, but as the honorable members' for Batman and Bendigo have told us something of the history of the industry here, I wish to add a little more. For the facts -which I am about to relate I am indebted to a speech made by the honorable member for Bendigo, when in the first Parliament he endeavoured to retain a duty on fuse which had been imposed by the Victorian Parliament. Under the Victorian duty a man named Perry commenced to make fuse at Bendigo, and he made a very good article. Messrs. Bickford, Smith and Company, the large English makers, offered to buy him out, but he would not sell because he was making a fair thing. Very little manual labour is employed in the making of fuses, most of the work being done by machinery. </para>

                        <para>- I am not objecting to that, but merely stating that the Bendigo factory is practically a branch of that Cornish firm. It cares very little whether we impose a duty or not, because, in those countries where a duty is imposed, it establishes a factory and secures the profit. I admit that a certain amount of labour is employed in the production of the fuse, but the profit goes to the firm. It sends out no fuse unless it is of a first-class character. I am not anxious that the factories at Bendigo and Footscray should have to " shut down," and, therefore, I am prepared to support duties of fd. and <inline font-style="italic">\d.</inline> per coil. We are told by the honorable member for Laanecoorie that if they did cease to exist, there would be no competition, because Nobel and Company enjoy a monopoly. Nobel and Company, and Bickford, Smith and Company are fighting one another, and that fight would not cease merely . because the Bendigo branch of the latter firm was closed. I am anxious to see the business carried on in Australia, especially by Perry and Company, who, I think, were treated badly by Bickford, Smith and Company. I have nothing to say against the Bendigo fuse, because, in my opinion, it is very good. If I thought that with duties of fd. and <inline font-style="italic">\d.</inline> per coil the local factories would have to close, I should be prepared to give them a little more protection ; but I do not think it is necessary. I ask the honorable member for Bendigo to say how much manual labour goes to make a coil of fuse? </para>

He has given some consideration, though not a great deal, to the mining industry. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Perry</inline> informed the Tariff Commission that 'when all his machines were in full work, he had employed twenty-three hands; but that then he had only eleven. On the question of profits, he said that he was only selling at a slight profit, and that when it turned to a loss he would shut down. Fuse was then on the free list, and, therefore, the statement that he was working at a loss is not proved. He said he was selling at only a slight profit, but he made no reference to a loss. </para>

                        <para>- At this factory, although there was not full work, they were able to sell at a profit, even without a duty on the imported article. In answer to question  99402, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Timson</inline> said that he estimated the proportion of the cost of fuse represented by labour at not more than½d. per coil, or at about  10  per cent. of the value of the finished article. In his evidence, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Perry</inline> said that the fuse was made by machinery as nearly perfect as could be, although the same kind of machines had been in use since  1870.  He stated that there was so little labour employed, that½d. per coil was estimated to cover the labour cost. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Burgess</inline> said that he was selling fuse " at very near cost " in the northern markets of Australia, and was not getting the profit there which he obtained in Victoria. That, he added, was due to the keenness of foreign competition ; the market had either to be met or lost. He could only compete in Western Australia by taking the price of the market there. Regarding the New Zealand trade, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Perry</inline> said that he got a better price in that Colony than in Victoria. These quotations show that the statement that the manufacturers will close up, and especially if we place fuse on the free list, are not substantiated. I admit that the Victorian fuse has a very good name. Some of the imported fuse is not so good ; but, generally speaking, the fuse that is used in Australia is of good quality. The reason why so many accidents do not occur in the use of fuse nowadays is not so much on account of an improvement in the article as because the supervision is better, and more responsibility is placed upon the men and the bosses. The compromise proposed is a very fair one. The protection proposed to be afforded to the makers will give them a larger market and more profit, whilst the mining industry will not be heavily burdened. </para>

                <para class="block">I think we ought to have the Prime Minister present when we come to a vote on this important matter. Probably no honorable member knows more about the subject than the honorable member for Bendigo, and he realizes how important the industry is, but we should have the Prime Minister present to express the views of the Government concerning it, especially as he represents a mining constituency. In reply to the remarks of the honorable member for Kalgoorlie, I should like to say that the wages paid in the fuse industry are not so low as he sought to convey. The report of the Victorian Factories Inspector, for the year ended  31st  December,  1906,  shows that thirty-five men employed in the industry received an average of  53s.10d.  per week. </para>

I suppose I have bought and used more fuse than any other member of this House. I always buy the best quality of fuse, and have never had an accident. The statements that have been made about the inferior quality of imported fuse are so much silly twaddle. There is no danger in using fuse, except, perhaps, when it falls into the hands of a person as inexperienced as the honorable member for Corio. Otherwise it is quite harmless.

It is a poison which is placed in the rabbit burrows, and is also used for dissolving phosphorus and other material used for the purpose of rabbit destruction.

Lantern slides of Australian subjects, which can be made here, ought to be dutiable, but lantern slides representing other places ought to be free. </para>

There are innumerable lantern slides which cannot be made here, or are not made here ; and the proposed duty seems to me an excessive tax on an amusement of the people. I ask the Treasurer to withdraw his amendment, with which I think most honorable members are in agreement, in order to permit me to include lantern slides of Australian subjects. </para>

Over 80 per cent. of the lantern slides used in Australia are now made here ; and I speak from considerable experience. The ordinary method of preparing slides of foreign pictures is to obtain a photograph from any part of the world, take a negative of it, and from that negative prepare the slide. </para>

No evidence with regard to them was given before the Tariff Commission, but since the Commission took evidence the largest manufacturers of photographic dry plates in the world have made arrangements to establish a factory in the Commonwealth. Under these circumstances, I ask the Minister to consider whether duties of 25 per cent. and 20 per cent. should not be imposed. </para>

                    <para>. - There seems to be no reason why engravers' plates should not be prepared in the Commonwealth. This is purely a city industry, and we have been taxing country industries in all directions. Surely engravers and lithographers are entitled to pay something on some of their requisites, especially as we have taxed the country printer on everything he uses except his paper. </para>

                    <para>.I think that the duty should be made1s. 6d. on the general Tariff and1s. in the second column. There is a clay pipe factory in the electorate of the honorable member for Parramatta, although he does not seem to be aware of it. About  30,000  gross are annually imported, and the competition against the local makers is very severe. We have a manufacturer of clay pipes in Parramatta, and also in Newtown, and I am assured that it is impossible for them, under existing circumstances, to continue to fight against their German competitors. On the other hand, if the duty were increased to1s. 6d. on foreign imports, and1s. per gross on imports from Great Britain, I am confident that the industry could be carried on successfully. The manufacturer at Newtown, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shaw,</inline> came from Great Britain some years ago, with the object of establishing the industry in Australia. He started operations in Victoria, and, failing to succeed, went to Sydney, where he has been struggling for some years to make a success of his business. I hope that the Treasurer will adopt my suggestion. </para>

If the local manufacturers were under a disability, they had an opportunity to appear before the Tariff Commission, and to ask for higher duties. The protectionist section of the Commission recommended a duty of1s. per gross, and that recommendation was adopted by the Government. Let the Minister stand by the duty originally proposed by him, and I shall refrain from further discussing the matter. If he adopts the suggestion of the honorable member for </para>

                        <para>- It is all very well for the honorable member, who can smoke shilling cigars, to object to clay pipes, but what about those who cannot afford to buy any others? We were led to believe that these were non-contentious items, but the Treasurer has suddenly sprung this proposal on the Committee. If it be pressed just now to a division, he may find himself in a rather awkward position; some of my honorable friends may feel inclined to leave the Chamber. That is what he must expect when he makes such a proposal at this hour of the morning. Why is this increased duty sought by the manufacturers ? </para>

                        <para>- I believe he employs five ; and that he does not want more than a duty of is. per gross. The honorable member for Cook says that the manufacturer requires the increased duty in order that he may sell a cheaper article; but if he can sell a cheaper article, he does not require an increased duty. I should not be reading the evidence, if I had been able to get from the Treasurer any explanation of the proposal which, has been made. I have been forced to look into the evidence given be'fore the Tariff Commission to see what justification, if any, there is for the proposed increase of duty. I might read the whole of this evidence, but I do not want to proceed to extremes. I warned the Treasurer that his proposal was likely to cause discussion. </para>

                        <para>- I think they will be charged the duty. In my opinion, it is most undesirable that a duty of 3d. per lb. should be. charged on coloured supplements such, as I have mentioned. Then there are a good many pictures which are imported in small parcels of twos and threes, such as <inline font-style="italic">Pears' Annual,</inline> which is a source of pleasure to many people. There is no justification whatever for the duty proposed, unless the Treasurer can arrange with the Department that illustrated pictures accompanying journals shall be admitted free. </para>

Consequently, the Department can provide that single copies of illustrated supplements, posted from Great Britain or elsewhere to Australia, shall be exempt from the duty proposed, which shall apply only to those supplements which are printed outside Australia, and which are imported in bulk. The proposal is a perfectly reasonable one in view of the fact that other matter of an almost identical character is subject to a duty of 6d. a lb. </para>

                        <para>- I have here two small celluloid boxes, which are practically identical, but, because one bears the word "trinkets,"' it has been charged duty at the rate of  35  per cent. while the other is admitted at the rate of  25  per cent. That is an anomaly. Surely the Customs officials can use their common sense in matters of this kind ? </para>

                        <para>-Both boxes are made of the same material, but that which bears the word "trinkets" is made dutiable at the same rate as is charged on the most valuable trinket boxes, some of which are worth several pounds, while the other is dutiable at  10  per cent. less. Surely they should be both charged at the same rate? This sort of thing makes it impossible for importers not to commit offences against the Customs law. </para>

                    No. At this period of the session I have little hope of carrying my amendment. At the same time, I think it is very desirable that I should state as shortly as I can some of the reasons which have prompted me to submit it. It will be observed that my amendment proposes to limit this exemption to such property of a State as is imported " for use in the public works or in the public service of such State."

I have waited here all night, as the honorable gentleman has done, and I have as much right to submit this proposal as he has to submit his. I did hope to be able to do so without any show of temper on his part. One objection constantly raised to any such exemption being given is, that a State might connive with private individuals to enable them to import goods in the name of the State. </para>

The declaration under this amendment would have to be made, either by a Minister or by a departmental officer of the State which was importing the material, to the effect that it was for public works purposes. Is it conceivable that any Minister or officer would make such a declaration for the purpose of defrauding the Commonwealth of revenue? The suggestion is preposterous. </para>

                    If the honorable member will move an amendment to that effect, I shall be prepared to give my views on it. Then we come to the question of goods which might be imported by a State for the purpose of being retailed or sold- to private individuals. Such goods would not be exempt under my amendment, because they would not be property imported for use on public works. So that there again the Commonwealth is protected. One very strong reason why it is desirable that, irrespective of what may be the rights, of the Commonwealth under the Constitution, we should adopt such an amendment as this, is that most of the imports of States Governments are on account of such works as railways, which are paid for out of loan money. Let us suppose that a large railway is in course of construction, involving the making of expensive bridges. A great deal of the material required, such as rails, &amp;c, must be imported. Let us suppose that the State pays in duty £20,000. That duty becomes, so to speak, part of the price paid for the material, and is paid out of loan money.

                    At the end of the financial year, £15,000 of that £20,000 would be paid over by the Commonwealth to the State as revenue. Therefore, that would be a means by which the State would convert part of its loan money into revenue, because the £15,000 would go into the Consolidated Revenue of the State as revenue pure and simple. As the honorable member for North Sydney says, it would be possible for the State to re-pay that revenue into its loan fund. But we know what Governments are, and how strong is the temptation to a Government to swell its revenue from every possible source. I venture to say that the circumstances would be very exceptional indeed, when any Government would repay money received from the Commonwealth into loan account by way of recoupment.

                <para>  Colonel FOXTON.  - The money would be received as revenue. I do not think that we should assist the States in doing such things as I have described. We should carry out the spirit as well as the letter of the Constitution. A great deal more could be said in favour of the amendment, but I do not wish to detain the Committee at this hour. I undertook to move this amendment and think it my duty to do so. I think that the reasons which I have given are sufficient. In my opinion- and I think my view is shared by a large number of people throughout Australia - it is desirable, whatever may be the powers conferred upon the Commonwealth by the Constitution, that there should be no attempt to strain those powers. By introducing' such a provision as this into the Tariff, this Parliament would give an indication that there is a desire, as far as possible, to settle those vexed questions which are now <inline font-style="italic">sub judice,</inline> upon a satisfactory basis, and1 would show that there is no wish on the part of the Commonwealth to take advantage of the States, or of any possible flaw which there may be in the wording of the section which I have quoted. </para>

Let me remind honorable members of what was done in New South Wales, and to a large extent led up to a very vexed case.

The Railways Commissioners, with the consent of the Government of the State, , imported a lot of material, and supplied it to one contractor to make waggons and other things required for the Department. All the other contracting firms were at once up in arms, because they were precluded from participating in this arrangement. That was the commencement of the trouble in New South Wales. </para>

                <para>Colonel FOXTON (Brisbane)  [6.16  a.m.]. - I am obliged to the honorable member for Parramatta for raising that point. But I suggest that the difficulty to which he has referred would arise under either of the forms of amendment proposed. However, the form suggested by the Treasurer might be adopted to meet the difficulty if it were preceded by the words " on and after  12th  December,  1907."  In view of the objection made by the honorable member for Parramatta,I think that, with that amendment, it would be better that the Treasurer should submit the new paragraph he has suggested. </para>

                        <para>. - I should like to say that I cordially agree with the proposal to exempt the personal importations of the Governors of the States, because they are the direct representatives of  His  Majesty. They stand in precisely the same relation to the States as the Governor-General does in relation to the Commonwealth. I think it would be only a graceful act to make this concession, and extend to the direct representatives of  His  Majesty in the States those privileges which they have enjoyed from time immemorial. It seems to me only a proper and a fitting thing to do, and I do not think the amendment should be so drawn as to cover any one but Governors of the States. </para>

There is an additional reason why Lieutenant-Governors should be given some consideration, in the fact that they receive no salary, especially when acting for a few weeks, or a few days. </para>

This is another instance of men who ask the Treasurer for the highest possible duties which they can get. and afterwards request to be exempted from the ordinary taxation which other citizens have to bear, and cheerfully pay. </para>

                        <para>- Evidently the honorable member is not aware of the fact that the Treasurer has moved to insert the words "of other material than glass" after the word "instruments." All these scientific instruments should be free. To tax them would be to do a great injustice to the scientists of Australia, and to those concerned in schools of mines and laboratories. I do not deny that some of the instruments are made in Australia, and they may be perfectly accurate so far as they go. But a scientist would not be altogether satisfied with the conditions under which they are made in Brisbane. These instruments are of no use unless they are made with the greatest delicacy. The amendment simply means that only those made of gun metal will be admitted free. I want honorable members to be seized of the facts. </para>

                    <para>. - It would be far better to give the gentleman in Brisbane who is making these instruments a bounty than to impose a duty for his benefit. Scientific men are not even satisfied with English-made instruments' in many cases. They send to Germany, or to the United States of America for particular instruments for particular purposes. They are certainly not likely to be content with Australian-made instruments when they want to make sure of obtaining the most scrupulous accuracy. It would be regrettable if every dairy in Australia was practically forced to buy a lactometer in which perfect confidence could not be put. What does the proposed duty amount to? </para>

In order that his deductions may be recognised elsewhere, a professor in Australia needs for the purposes of his scientific investigations instruments of the same high grade as those used in the Old World. If an astronomer here were to observe certain nebulae, it would be necessary that the instrument with which he made his observations should correspond with those used in other parts of the world. </para>

When invited by the Treasurer to vote for a duty of .50 per cent, for the protection of a Victorian industry, he has done so without blushing; but when he is asked to vote for a duty for the assistance of a Queensland industry, he immediately begins to talk about the Milky Way, and the standard of Paris, Berlin, and other cities, with a view of showing that the proposed protection should not be granted. When the honorable member can turn a* political somersault with such consummate ease, I am satisfied as to his consistency and his ideas of protection. </para>

                    <para>.When this question was before the Committee in another form, I voted with representatives of Queensland for the protection of this industry. It did matter to me, as a protectionist, if those honorable members voted free-trade on every other question. If men in any part of the world can make any article, there are men in Australia who can make it, if they are given encouragement. When honorable members, in dealing with industries carried on in their own States, talk of the work that Australians can do', and then refuse to protect the work of Australians in other States, they are grossly inconsistent. I am prepared to support a duty upon these articles. </para>

We have had some difficulty on this side in bringing the honorable member to reason on fiscal questions. He has supported the Government when their own supporters have left them, and this is the reward he gets. I hope it will induce the honorable member to turn over a new leaf. </para>

                <para>Mr.MALONEY (Melbourne)  [8.15  a.m.]. - I have here <inline font-style="italic">The Shipping World Year-Book,</inline> in which the principal Tariffs of the world are published. It will be seen that they contain schedules of prohibited goods. St. Vincent, for instance, prohibits the importation of plants, seeds, berries, earth, soil, and vegetable matter used for packing or covering imports from Ceylon, Natal, South India, Mauritius, and the Straits Settlements. Ceylon and Mauritius have similarly drastic prohibitions. I suggest that our prohibitions, most of which are embodied in the Customs Act, should be printed as a schedule attached to the Tariff. </para>

                    <para>. - It is quite true that this provision was in the old Tariff, but since then we have given the manufacturers of these goods very much higher protection, viz. :  -  30  and  25  per cent., and I do not quite see why we should go further and rebate to them three-fourths of that duty. Why should they not be put on the same footing as other manufacturers? Since they have got a protection of  30  and  25  per cent., it seems to me to be absurd to give a rebate of three-fourths of it. Let them be treated like other manufacturers who are subject to competition. </para>

                        <para>- But why should persons who happen to manufacture waterproof cloth get this advantage over every other kind of manufacture? It is an anomalous item to put in the Tariff. Certainly, it cannot be called a scientific Tariff, when certain manufacturers are singled out for specially favorable treatment. I should like to know the reason for this proposal, and if there is no reason why these manufacturers should be treated differently from any others, it ought not to be done, I think. </para>
