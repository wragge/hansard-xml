If so, is it his opinion that there is universal regret that the honorable member for Maribyrnong has ceased to act as Postmaster-General, since he has outstripped his Ministerial companions who had years of a start, and does the Minister intend to resign his portfolio in favour of his colleague with a view to allaying this regret? </para>

The honorable member for Maribyrnong carried out his duties in the Post Office,, as he carried out his duties in connexion with the Northern Territory trip, in a very satisfactory way, and I believe that the opinion expressed in the <inline font-style="italic">Review of Reviews</inline> is held by a good number of persons in this country. </para>

                            <para>.- I shall begin my remarks by expressing regret that up to the present stage of this debate we have not had the privilege of listening to the Prime Minister. Notwithstanding the absence of the leader of the Opposition, for reasons about which I am not called upon to express an opinion, J think that, as the Prime Minister has just returned from a visit to the old country, where he took part in a Conference with representatives from all parts of the British Empire, he had no justification for withholding from the House information as to what was done there. </para>

                            <para>- I did not know that, and I am sorry to hear it. I hope that we shall have the privilege of listening to the honorable and learned gentleman as soon as he is in health again, because it would be most reprehensible to allow to pass the earliest opportunity for informing the House of what took place at the Conference. The position of affairs in this Chamber to-day is much the same as that which existed during last Parliament. We had a general election! in December last, but on the new House reassembling,,: although the cry of many members of the Ministry had been that' a change in the Tariff was urgently necessary, we were immediately asked to consent to a prorogation for several months. According to some members, the settlement of the Tariff question was an urgent matter two years ago. </para>

                            <para>- We heard that persons would have to go without their Christmas dinner in 1904 because of the starving condition of some of the Victorian industries then, but while the Deakin Administration has been in office ever since, they have done nothing in the matter, except to announce that the Tariff Commission has presented reports from time to time. I am anxious to have the Tariff question settled, and the Ministers now in power are those who should bring forth proposals for settling it. But, while engaged on this work, to use the language of Jim in the " Squaw Man," " They should not stop to pick flowers on the way." Although most members of the Government fought their elections upon the issue of granting effective protection to our industries, at least one Minister did nothing of the kind.

I wish to say that although I believe some members of the Government are genuinely in favour of granting an increased measure of protection to Australian industries, the Treasurer is not. The sole issue upon which he fought the recent election in Western Australia was an anti-Labour one. </para>

But I propose to deal with his attitude in regard to the Tariff question.

This would give them a majority, and every single measure that was passed would have to be approved by that party. This seemed to him one of the gravest questions they had to confront. The Labour Party would then carry out their whole platform, which was against the vested interests of the community, and it meant taking from those that had, and giving to those that had not. They had no admiration for self-denial or economy, but they took the industry of others and gave it to those who had not been so industrious. </para>

To my mind it is an extraordinary circumstance that a gentleman who has had a pretty considerable public career, who has occupied a proud position in the politics of his State for many years, should in the final stages of that career be so absolutely incapable of giving effect to the opinions which he has so openly expressed. I would also remind honorable members that we have had experience of the right honorable gentleman as a constitutionalist.

Apparently the only consideration which weighs with the Treasurer is whether he is a member of the Government of the day. If he is, everything is satisfactory from his stand-point, but if not, the reverse is the case. There is another complaint which I have to urge against the right honorable gentleman, and it is certainly the most serious of all. Whilst his attitude upon the Tariff question undoubtedly  evidenced, to use sporting language, " an extraordinary reversal of form," it did not inflict any considerable injury upon the Commonwealth. But to his action in another connexion we should all give serious attention. During the progress of the recent campaign it was not an unusual thing to find the Treasurer openly coquetting with the anti-Federal movement, promoted by a small section in Western Australia. In one of his after dinner speeches at Newcastle he went so far as to assert that - </para>

                            <para>- It is where .he will be in the near future if I can get him there. Throughout Western Australia we had to contend during the recent campaign with this anti-Federal feeling, and I do say that it i; most reprehensible for a Federal Minister, who has sworn to uphold the Commonwealth Constitution, to give expression to utterances which can only tend to embitter the feeling which exists between the States and the Federation. Now, I wish to say a word or two in reference to the Conference of Premiers which was recently held in Brisbane. In my judgment, the correct title to apply to such gatherings would be "the anti-Federal conspiracy." Whenever the State Premiers have met since the establishment of Federation, they have in the main discussed questions with which this Parliament alone is competent to deal, whilst the tone of their debates has been distinctly hostile and embarrassing to the Federal authority. At the recent Conference in Brisbane, the Federal Treasurer practically gave his consent - and, I presume, that of the Government- to a continuance for a period of ten years of the financial relations between the States and the Commonwealth upon a basis somewhat similar to that underlying existing relations. Paragraph 6 of the Governor-General's Speech reads - </para>

                        <para>The subject of the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States has been further discussed with the States Premiers, and the results arrived at will be  communicated  to you. The great issues affected, including the federalization of old-age pensions, will be considered in this relation. </para>

                    <para class="block">I wish to say that if there be one question more than another upon which the attitude of the Government has brought them into popular contempt, it is that of Federal old-age pensions. Although the Treasurer, speaking at Bunbury recently, shed crocodile tears in discussing the position of the aged poor of Western Australia, he concluded his address by telling them that, under existing financial conditions, the Commonwealth had not the means to pay them the pensions that he would like them to receive; but these conditions were soon to be ended. Despite this declaration, which was evidently made for the purpose of misleading the old mer. and women of that State, he attended the Conference of Premiers at Brisbane, and actually agreed to a proposal to continue the existing financial relations between the States and the Commonwealth for a period of ten years on nearly the present basis. In my opinion, the arrangement which he made with the States Premiers would hamper the Commonwealth to such an extent that its sphere of usefulness must be very seriously reduced. Although I am not opposed to a reasonable return being made' by the Commonwealth to the States, I certainly object to the continuance of the system prevailing under the Braddon section, whilst I consider that, from the Commonwealth point of view, the new scheme proposed by the Federal Treasurer would be infinitely worse. As to the taking over of the States debts, I think that the Government, if they wish to settle the question, must either exercise their right under the Constitution to take over the debts existing at the time of the establishment of the Federation, or seek further constitutional powers. Judging by the attitude of the States Premiers, I do not think there is a possibility of our securing from the States anything to which we are not entitled under the Constitution. That being so, if we desire to effect the savings that we are told must result from the taking over of the debts of the States, we should either make up our minds to exercise our present powers, or seek from the people an extension of our constitutional authority 'enabling us to take over the whole of the debts. I am sure that such an extension would be readily granted. I sincerely hope that, in the near future, arrangements will be made to place the finances of the Commonwealth on such a basis that an end may be put to the dreary repetition of the statement in speech after speech by the Governor-General that the Government intend to establish a system of old-age pensions. Instead of such promises, let us have the announcement that a scheme so beneficial has actually been carried into effect. Having regard to public opinion, a Government that is not prepared to face! the necessities of the situation in this regard has no right to remain in office. There are other matters which indicate that the Treasurer's Federal spirit is a doubtful quantity, but since the right honorable gentleman has left the Chamber I shall not refer to them. Turning from the financial problem to other considerations, may I say that I trust that in any new agreement for the carriage of our oversea mails we shall achieve something better than we had under the mail contract recently cancelled. It was apparent months ago to any one familiar with the methods of financial speculators and syndicate hawkers, that the contract was in the hands of such men, and the Government, by allowing them to trifle with them, and failing earlier to take decisive action, have held themselves up to the contempt of the people of Australia. I trust that in any new agreement that may be entered into, provision will be made for a substantial deposit being lodged with the Government as a guarantee of good faith. For some months prior to the cancellation of the contract, it was pointed out again, and again that the contractors were not making such progress with the building of the ships and the other arrangements necessary for the carrying out of their agreement as might reasonably be expected ; and I sincerely trust that we shall take care that the Federation henceforth is not used by syndicators for money-making purposes. The transfer of the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth is another question of great importance. From the meagre information that I have been able to secure from the Government since my return to Melbourne, I am forced to the conclusion that the agreement which the Prime Minister entered into with the Premier of South Australia was made without careful consideration ;as to the possibility of the undertaking being made a profitable and satisfactory one. I am at one with those who say that it is absolutely essential to people the Northern Territory. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. Another point to which I desire to refer relates to the alleged labour necessities of Queensland. The attitude adopted by the Government in regard to this matter shows that they are far from being in sympathy with the aspirations of the people of Australia. They are permitting agreements to be made for the importation of foreign labour - so Jong as it is white labour - to be employed in the cane-fields. Representatives of Queensland who were resident in that State a few years ago know that, although foreign labour is imported for a particular purpose, it invariably drifts from the sugar fields into other employments. </para>

                            <para>- And so do I, and I wish to see the industry continued as successfully as it is at present ; but I think that the honorable member for Oxley will admit that the attitude of this Parliament towards the sugar industry has been pretty generous throughout. The Government ought, however, to insist on an effort being made to obtain labour in the British Dominions before the representatives of those engaged in the sugar industry are permitted to seek it in foreign countries. I have been in communication with several of the immigrants who lately arrived in New South Wales under the conditions offered by the Government of that State, and amongst these were notably some Scotchmen, who assured me that if the conditions of labour in the Queensland sugar industry had been made known in many parts of Scotland and the North of England, they were certain there would have been no necessity to go to foreign countries for labour. In my opinion the agents of the sugar planters in Queensland have made no serious effort up to the present time to get British labour. </para>

                            <para>- That is unfortunate, if so, and there ought to be a provision in any agreement made for contract labour in this industry that there shall be efforts to secure men in Great Britain before foreigners may be engaged. In this connexion there is certainly room for an alteration in the attitude adopted by the Government, who, I hope, will do all that is possible to encourage the immigration of Britishers in preference to foreigners. The speech of the Governor-General mentions another matter about which honorable members of previous Parliaments have already heard much. This is an assurance that a Bill relating to the site of the seat of Government will be submitted. Although I place the chief blame, and nearly all the blame, for the delay which has occurred upon the present New South Wales Premier, I think this Government have not done quite as much as they might have done to reach finality. There is no necessity for us, who are conversant with the facts, to have the history of these negotiations repeated. We know, however, that in the opinion of the members of this Parliament the settlement of the site of the Federal Capital is constitutionally in the hands of the Commonwealth ; further, that certain sites, including Dalgety, were offered by a previous New South Wales Premier, and that both Houses of this Parliament agreed on the site I have just mentioned. </para>

                            <para>- The Dalgety site was amongst those offered by the then Premier of New South Wales, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> See, and I am sure that the honorable member who interjects will admit that it is only a quibble to say that this site was not offered, but that Bombala was. The Federal Parliament carried out its portion of the contract, and settled on a site which, in our opinion, would be acceptable to the people of Australia. That decision was arrived at by a majority vote of both Houses j but New South Wales got a new Premier, in the person of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers,</inline> who deliberately withdrew the offer, and broke the agreement entered into by the previous Premier. Personally, I desire to see this question of the Federal Capital Site settled, and New South Wales given that to which she is entitled under the bond. This I am prepared to grant to New South Wales at the earliest possible moment, but when that State has deliberately broken the promise she gave to the Commonwealth I refuse to reverse the vote I previously gave for what, in my opinion, is the best possible site. Of course I do not know what are the provisions of the promised Bill, or how it will advance the settlement of the question, but there is no doubt that we shall have to face the inevitable. The Commonwealth Parliament must take one of two courses - we must bow to the New South Wales Parliament, and let the latter choose the site, or we must assert our constitutional rights, and make ourselves possessors of the territory on which we have decided. </para>

In my opinion there is no truth in the cry raised by the Premier and the newspapers of New South Wales, in order to embitter the feeling against Federation, that the people of Victoria are anxious to retain the Seat of Government within their borders. </para>

                            <para>- That is so, I believe; at any rate, I have never heard any desire or opinion expressed to that effect while I have been resident in Victoria. However, all that does not affect my position ; I desire to see the question settled quickly. The Commonwealth ought not to bow down to the State of New South Wales in view of the fact that a site has already been constitutionally agreed upon. My opinion is that provision should be made to permit the highest legal tribunal in the Commonwealth to decide once and for all whether the Commonwealth or the State of New South Wales has the power to fix the Capital Site, and I hope the Government will take steps to that end with all reasonable despatch. In the last paragraph of  His  Excellency's speech mention is made of the proposed Transcontinental Railway Survey Bill. </para>

                            <para>- There is absolutely no analogy between the two positions. In the case of the Federal Capital site, there was a written promise given - a promise which, in my opinion, the Federal Parliament is desirous to carry out. In the other case, there was a verbal or implied promise by the leaders of the Federal movement, and there now seems to be a disposition on the part of a section of the Federal Parliament to repudiate that promise. As I say, Parliament is desirous to settle the question of the Federal site, whereas the majority in another place do not seem to approve of the construction of the transcontinental railway. If there be any analogy between the positions, Parliament is doing what it can to settle the question of the Capital Site, but has not done all it can to settle the question of the railway. I am pleased to see in  His  Excellency's speech a reference to the granting of bounties for the encouragement of industries. The great natural resources of Australia - which might have been exploited years  ago - have, owing to the absence of a little assistance, been allowed to remain undeveloped. That position will, I believe, be overcome by the granting of a bounty. Although we have the squealing Premier of New, South Wales stating that he is opposed to any action on the part of the Federal Government in connexion with the iron industry, I believe that that industry will require further assistance than has been granted by the State Government, and, personally, I am prepared, as a member of this House, to give that assistance. The pearling industry is another that could be benefited by the application of the bounty system. That industry at present is entirely in the hands of coloured people, although white people are as competent and successful divers as the men now engaged. The only difficulty is the absence of any assistance or <inline font-style="italic">encouragement,</inline> and I think it would be possible to grant a bounty Cn a well-matured system, which would lead to the encouragement of white labourers and the displacement of foreigners. </para>

                            <para>- I have no desire to undertake such an impossible task, but I &lt;lo desire to encourage the (employment of white Australians and Britishers in preference to coloured people. There are no other points in  His  Excellency's speech to which I desire to refer. In conclusion, I may say that if the Government show any desire to so amend the Tariff as to make it thoroughly effective, and, if the member, of the Government to whom I made particular allusion this morning is still prepared to swallow everything and remain in his present position, I shall still be prepared to assist in getting the Tariff out of the way. As to other matters, I shall take a later opportunity to express ray views more fully. I hope the consideration of the Tariff will be proceeded with almost immediately. I am sorry that the natural companion to the Tariff is not mentioned <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> conjunction with that measure in His Excellency's speech. When we talk of immigration and of the necessity for population, we seem to forget that the land monopolist is the greatest bar to progress in this connexion, and, although we are always hearing the expression of opinions in favour of attracting immigration to our shores, and of providing employment in Australian industries - at the expense of the Commonwealth revenue - no effort has been made, by the imposition of an equitable land tax, to cause land to be available for our people, and to obtain revenue for a humane system of old-age pensions. This is a deficiency for which the Prime. Minister may be able to give us a reason, and I hope to. have an opportunity of listening to him in the near future. </para>

I was present at the Queen's Hall in Perth when <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Thurston</inline> was asked if he was a protectionist or a free-trader, and I heard him say that, while in the past his sympathies had been with free-trade, he was now sure that protection is the proper thing for Australia, and came before the constituency as a protectionist. Therefore nothing could be said against the Treasurer for supporting <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Thurston,</inline> supposing that he did so. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Thurston</inline> was opposing a freetrader in the honorable member who represents Perth. I can understand a professional man being a free-trader, but I do not know why a Labour man should be one. In my opinion all Labour men should be protectionists. The remarks of the honorable member for Kalgoorlie about the Treasurer were quite uncalled for. I wish that there were more men who had done as much for Australia as the Treasurer has done, and, although I am not a follower of the right honorable gentleman, I shall not allow him to be abused in his absence.

                                <para>- The members of the Labour Party do not know enough about the old-age pensions question. If they knew more, a practical scheme might emanate from them. In my opinion, provision for the establishment of an old-age pensions fund might be made in a manner similar to that in which insurance premiums are collected in regard to the men employed on large railway contracts and by mining companies, all of whom are insured. The money so collected might very well pass into the hands of the Government, instead of going to the insurance companies, and be used to establish a fund both for the relief of cases of distress and for the payment of pensions. I would not confine these pensions wholly to old persons; because many young men are as much incapacitated by injury or sickness from earning a living as are old people by their age. The present mode of collecting premiums is a very simple one, based on the analysis of the pay sheets ; but I should like to make it necessary for all employers of labour, including those who have only one domestic, to act as collectors for the Government for the establishment and maintenance of a pensions and relief fund. I think that this could be done by requiring all employers to affix to their pay sheets stamps, procurable at any post office, of a value proportionate to the wages paid. </para>

                                <para>- I do not feel at liberty now to deal with the subject in great detail. The present compensation law does not always work quite satisfactorily, because,, occasionally, injured men to whom compensation is due get into the hands of unscrupulous persons, who take care that nearly the whole amount is eaten up in professional costs. The members of the Labour Party are always calling upon others to do something for the establishment of a pensions fund, but I should like them to give attention to the formulation of a practicable scheme. I think that if my suggestion were adopted, it could be put into working order within a month, and it would provide a simple and effective means of collecting money. I trust that it will be considered when the question of pensions is before the House. At the same time I should like the term " old-age pensions " system to be abolished, and something better put in its place. </para>

                                <para>- It is the employers. We have been sent here to study the best interests of Australia, and we should try to justify our existence by satisfying our constituents that we are working earnestly for their good. This we cannot do if personal matters are constantly being imported into the debates. I hope that all the matters mentioned in the GovernorGeneral's speech will be dealt with in due course, and that consideration will be given at the proper time to the suggestions which I have made. I believe that money for a pension system can be collected without harassing any industry, and without calling upon the public to pay more than is now being paid. </para>

                            <para>. - I have read the address of  His  Excellency the Governor-General very carefully. The honorable member for Gippsland congratulated us upon the departure from precedent shown in its form ; but, to my mind, there is nothing commendable in that. In the first place we find that it is addressed to nobody in particular, but to the world at large or to anybody who may choose to take it to himself. Further, it contains no reference to the question of granting Supply. Whether the statement be true, which was published in the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> that this omission was made in order to placate the Senate, I cannot say, but I very much question the right of the other branch of the Legislature to have .an equal voice with this House in the granting of Supply. I am of opinion that the speech should have contained a reference to the question of voting Supply, and that such reference should have been addressed to members of this House only. Then I should like to protest against a third omission from the speech. I observe that all reference to Divine Providence has been omitted from it - even the customary prayer at the end of it. The statement which commends itself most to my judgment is contained in paragraph 10, which relates to the cancellation of the mail contract. So ends what is perhaps the greatest piece of muddling with which the present Government has been associated. Personally I regret that the contract was not cancelled months ago. The long-drawn-out negotiations have brought, only ridicule upon the Commonwealth and discredit upon the Ministry. As soon as it was seen that the <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> of the syndicate were open, to question, that it had merely secured a speculative option for the purpose of exploiting the London money market, action should have been taken to cancel the contract. It was not sufficient for the Postmaster-General to adopt his usual attitude of admitting nothing and denying everything. I hope that the new specifications will be so drawn that there will be no room for a repetition of such muddling, and that the Commonwealth Government will insist upon a substantial cash deposit being made as an evidence of the <inline font-style="italic">bond fides</inline> of tenderers. To my mind it is one of the most serious indictments which can be levelled against Federal administration that after six years' experience of it there is a feeling of antagonism to it throughout all the States. We have bitter complaints concerning Federal administration, not only from New South Wales, but from Queensland and Western Australia. </para>

                                <para>- The reason under: lying these complaints is that Federation has not fulfilled the great predictions which were made at the time it was inaugurated. At that period we had streams of oratory, which were intended to show the absolute necessity of enacting uniform laws throughout the States. We were assured that we needed uniform banking, company, and bankruptcy laws. But nothing has been done by Parliament in that' direction, and after six years' experience of Federation we merely find a reference to them at the fag end of the Governor-General's speech. I say that it behoves us to do our best to redeem the promises which were made when the Federation was established. Even in connexion with the transferred Departments we have not had any judicious administration. In the Post Office, which was one of the first Departments taken over, we have found that the last state is worse than the first. Even now we have no uniform administration in connexion with the Department. We have not a uniform stamp for the Commonwealth. The stamps sold in one State by the Commonwealth Government are dishonoured by the Federal authorities in an adjoining State. Similarly we have no uniform telegraph forms, and we have different postal notes. I was recently informed that a gentleman handed in at the Brisbane Post Office a telegram which was written upon a New South Wales telegraph form, and the officer in charge refused to accept it until it was written upon a Queensland form. So much for Federal administration. Then we have a constant concentration of Federal business in Melbourne. It is very difficult to ascertain whether certain matters are being dealt with in Sydney or in Melbourne. Just before I came to this city I had occasion to call at the General Post Office in Sydney to make an inquiry about a long-promised site for a new post office at Lithgow. I was informed that the matter was in the hands of the Department of Home Affairs, and that I would need to make inquiries here. </para>

The Telephone Department does not evidence any better administration, though the Postmaster-General has only told us that when he obtains new telephones we may expect ;a better state of affairs. A good deal has been said during the course of the debate upon the question of the Federal Capital. So far as New South Wales is concerned, nothing h,as created such a bitter anti-Federal spirit as has the unsatisfactory position which exists to-day in regard to this matter The honorable member for New England deprecated what he called the parochial spirit of the honorable member for Lang. But, to my mind, it is not a question of parochialism, but of adhering to a bargain which has been made. In a reply which he made to the honorable member for Maranoa, he stated that the cry in reference to the Federal Capital in New South Wales was merely a political one, which was raised by a few Sydney merchants. In making th,at statement he showed that he is in absolute ignorance of the real state of affairs there. In my own electorate, which is not a metropolitan one, but which is, of course, the most important in New South Wales- </para>

                                <para>- No. It is within the hundred mile radius, so that it has no special interest in the selection of the Seat of Government. But wherever I went during my campaign, whether it was amongst the ironworkers of Lithgow, the railway employes of Penrith, the farmers of Castlereagh and Campbelltown, the workers of Granville, or the residents of the various tourist resorts in the mountains, I found that this feeling of irritation at what they deemed to be the unfair treatment of New South Wales was rampant. Whenever I omitted to refer to the question of the Capital site, I was in variably asked whether I would do all in my power to expedite its settlement. The position of New South Wales prior to Federation was very different from that of any of the other States. This House must always recollect that in New South Wales there was a very strong minority against Federation from the beginning to the end of the fight. If I remember rightly, there were over 83,000 electors who voted against the Constitution Bill upon the referendum. One of the strongest arguments used by the opponents of that measure, particularly by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pilcher</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. McLaurin,</inline> was that the clause which gave the Seat of Government to New South Wales was merely a bogy, that the Federal Capital would be located in Melbourne, and would remain there for an indefinite period. That statement was broadcasted throughout New South Wales. It was repeated so frequently that the champions of Federation there deemed it necessary to secure personal letters from the Premiers of the other States indignantly repudiating the -suggestion. These letters were published at the time. Now those who fought for Federation are continually being met with the very irritating statement, " I told you so. What I said h,as come absolutely true." I admit that it has come true, inasmuch as the Seat of Government is still in Melbourne, and is, apparently, likely to remain there for some time. The bargain which was ni,ade with New South Wales was that the Capital should be within its borders, but not within 100 miles of Sydney. I do not forget that that limit was agreed to as a compromise between two proposals. The feeling in New South Wales is that the Federal Capital ought to be somewhere on the line of the 100-mile limit. The honorable member for Kalgoorlie was very insistent that there was an unwritten promise that we should have a transcontinental railway connecting Western Australia with the eastern States. </para>

                                <para>- That" is so. The honorable member for Kalgoorlie appeals to the House to observe the spirit of a promise which he says was made during the Federal campaign in Western Australia. I, for one, am willing to go with him in making that appeal ; but I ask in turn that the Parliament shall observe the spirit of the promise made to New South Wales that the Federal Capital would be established somewhere about the 100-mile 'limit which represents the compromise of contending interests, and is provided for in the Constitution. A good deal has been said as to the taking over of the Northern Territory, and those honorable members who visited the Territory returned impressed, at any rate, with the necessity for the transfer. The question of the agreement entered into, however, stands altogether apart from the general proposition that the Commonwealth should take over and administer the Territory.  I, for one, cannot indorse the agreement that has been made. To my mind, the bargain is wholly one-sided. South Australia, over and over again, wishes to dictate what we should do. She desires to make a bargain as to the point to which the transcontinental railway should run, whilst, at the same time, she eases herself of an annual deficiency variously estimated at from £180,000 to ^250, 000. If the Federation is going to relieve South Australia of so heavy a burden, surely we ought to have much better terms than are to be found in the provisional agreement to be brought before us. I agree with the honorable member who has said that we do not desire the construction of a railway either in South Australia or any other part of the Commonwealth upon the land grant principle. We do not wish to have repeated here the experience of Canada, where the . Canadian Pacific Railway Company has practically dominated politics for the last fifteen or twenty years. I regret that the speech contains no reference to the intentions of the Government with respect to the establishment of a small-arms factory. We were led to believe that the Minister was very strongly impressed with the urgent necessity of such an establishment, and I had hoped to see some reference to the project in  His  Excellency's speech; but we find that what is, to my mind, one of the most important matters relating to defence has been absolutely ignored. We also fail to discover any reference to the Naval Agreement. I was aghast when I read the statement reputed to have been made by thf Prime Minister that, conditionally upon his securing the consent of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Ward, he would ask Australia to terminate the Naval Agreement with Great Britain. If such a statement was made by the Prime Minister he absolutely misunderstood the sentiment of the Commonwealth. We re cognise that the very existence of Australia, from the time of its birth, has been dependent upon the British Navy. We know that it was only the breaking up of the navies of other European nations during the Napoleonic wars that made it possible for Lord John Russell to make his famous declaration, when, about 1830, in reply to a question from the French Minister as to what portion of Australia England claimed, he said, " We claim the whole." It was only because for seventy, years after Waterloo Britain held uninterrupted and unquestioned sway over the oceans of the world that we were able to claim and keep Australia. We have, in the division of Papua, an illustration of what might have happened to Australia but for the British Navy. We know that the Island of New Guinea has been divided amongst three different nationalities, and but for the British Navy the same fate might have befallen this Continent. I am glad that the Prime Minister admits that it is because of the power of the British Navy that we have been able to hold, and still hold, the Northern Territory. I go further, however, and say that it is because of the power of that navy, and the fear of the British flag, that we are able to hold, and still hold, not merely the Northern Territory, but the whole of Australia. I, for one, shall not be a party to anything that will lessen the great influence of that" navy upon Australia. The annual payment made by the Commonwealth under the Naval Agreement should, in my opinion, be increased rather than decreased. I am willing that Australia should build more ships provided that we have but one undivided control of the navy, and it seems to me that the question to be determined is trending more and more in the direction of whether we should have here a divided control or one control of the whole navy throughout the length and breadth of the Empire. Our true aim should be not so much to secure an independent Australian Navy as to maintain the undivided control of the whole fleet of the Empire. I. welcome the reference in the speech to the administration of Papua, and hope that we shall do something which will make our administration an object-lesson to the whole world, showing what the Federation is able to accomplish. But until we can implant in the hearts of our own people absolute confidence in the Commonwealth, I have not much hope of our being able to take over more (powers with any reasonable prospect of popular approval. I trust that the promise made in the last paragraph of the speech will soon be realized, and that we may soon be able to take in hand the proper lighting of the coasts of this great Continent. There is much force in the assertion made by the honorable member for Capricornia, that it i3 unfair that Queensland should be asked to light the whole of her extensive coastline, since such a work is practically of greater benefit to other States than to that part of the Continent. Any one who has travelled along the Inner Passage cannot but realize the absolute necessity for a more efficient system of lighting than at present exists between Cooktown and Port Darwin, and I hope the time will soon come when we shall have from this House an expression of opinion upon these and other matters of vast importance to Australia. </para>

                            <para>. - I listened attentively to the speech made by the honorable member for Gippsland, who by his matter, and the method of his delivery, made it plain to the veriest tyro that although he is new to this Parliament he is not unaccustomed to public speaking. I take exception, however, to the remark made by him that we should depart from the ancient usage of bringing forward an Address-in-Reply to the Speech from the Throne. In my view, the debate on the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply at the opening of Parliament affords a valuable opportunity for criticising the actions of the Government during, recess. The acts of the present Administration certainly lend themselves to criticism on the part of the Opposition, and there are many matters in  His  Excellency's Speech to which I take exception. In the first place, I notice that the reference which it makes to the Imperial Conference is so guarded that it is exceedingly difficult to take exception to it. Nothing is said about the success or otherwise of the Conference; but, having read the reports of its proceedings as published in the Home journals, I am forced to the- conclusion that the Prime Minister1, who left Australia somewhat under a cloud, and received on his return the plaudits of the multitude, must himself admit that he has not succeeded to the degree that the Commonwealth expected. I take exception to the selection which the Government made of representatives of the Commonwealth at the two recent Conferences in England. Why was the </para>
                        </talk.start>
                        <para class="block">Minister of Trade and Customs selected to&gt; represent Australia? He certainly went to England without any mandate from Parliament. I recognise, of course, that the Ministry had the power to appoint whom it pleased, and have no doubt that they found it very convenient to send the Minister to the Navigation Conference, since such a man as the Treasurer was to be Acting Prime Minister during the absence of the leader of the Government. The position reminds one of the story of the individual who had to cross a river in a boat, taking with him a fox and a goose, and who found it very undesirable to leave both of them together on the land. Had he left the Treasurer and the Minister of Trade and Customs behind, goodness knows what might have happened ! As it was, he took away the Minister of Trade and Customs ; and thus was able without fear of trouble, to leave behind him the late Acting Prime Minister. The Minister of Trade and Customs, when in England, acted in a way which I do not think met with the approval of the people of Australia. The honorable member called down on his head what was really a reflection on us as a people. It was pointed out to him that he must remember that while in England he was the guest of the nation, and should conduct himself in the manner that guests are expected to observe. That I consider a reflection on us as a nation, and  1  regret very much that such a criticism should have been called forth. So far, this debate has been of a very quiet and desultory nature, for what reason I do not know. I suppose it is because no one quite knows, in the present state of parties, what the next turn of the political kaleidoscope may bring forth. We are very much like men about to engage in a contest on the mat. We shake hands and look at each other across the floor, waiting to see what sort of hold we may get an opportunity to take. I can see quite well that this little simile appeals to the Postmaster-General. </para>

                                <para>- It would appear that we are all afraid to open our mouths and say what we think. Later, perhaps, when the fight begins, matters may alter. Just at this present juncture, I should have liked to hear something from the Prime Minister as to the attitude of the present Government. When matters of the kind now under discussion are before the House, we  do not expect members of the Government to sit still and say nothing, but we look to them to lead the House. Nothing, however, has been said by the Prime Minister, nor have we heard anything from the leader of the Labour Party. I further regret to say that the leader of the Opposition is not present, though we know there are certain circumstances in his case which preclude his attendance. What are the facts in regard to the offers made by the Commonwealth Government to the Imperial Government in the matter of preferential trade? It was very easy, indeed, for astute statesmen like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Churchill</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Asquith</inline> to at once see through the offer which the Australian Prime Minister presented. What did the Australian representative offer? The Imperial Government asked for bread and the Prime Minister offered a stone; all the preference he could offer was to raise the Tariff of Australia against the foreigner, and to maintain the present Tariff as against the mother country. That was not preference; it was simply another method of taking the bread out of the mouths of the British working men. In order to show what the opinion of the British working men and the Labour Party in the old country is on this matter, I shall take the liberty to quote from a report which appeared in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of the 2nd of this month as follows :  - </para>

                            <para>Twenty-two Labour members of the House of Common's, belonging to the trade union group, have issued a manifesto headed " The Colonial Conference and Preferential Trade." </para>
                            <para>In this document the declaration is made that it is time the British working man protested against the absurdities of the contentions of some of the colonial Premiers. </para>
                            <para>This shows exactly the feeling of the British working man, whatever may be the feeling of the working man in Australia. </para>
                            <para>Although New Zealand's white population only equalled that of the Birmingham district, and Australia's half of London's, their Premiers assumed to treat with Great Britain with 40,000,000, as nation with nation, using threats if we refused their demand. Yet Canada, which had made the most advance in national importance, being represented by a statesman, dissociated herself from these demands. New Zealand demanded preference for her products and manufactures - not foodstuffs or raw materials only - though knowing perfectly well that this could not be given unless we altered our whole fiscal system,  and  taxed all  foreign  imports. Even with a liberal estimate of the value of colonial preference, the advocates of the principle were  unable  to show  that  the increase  of  the present trade with the colonies would be beyond from 10 to 15 per cent., affecting about a quarter of 1 per cent. of the total British trade. In return for this magnificent result, securing¼ per cent. fewer unemployed, the cost of every necessary article consumed by the British ' workman would be increased. </para>
                            <para>The manifesto ridicules the Premiers who supported the foolish proposition that a small rise in the price of wheat would not affect the price of bread, and quotes approvkingly Professor Marshall's declaration that free-trade was never more essential to Great Britain's prosperity than now. " Needless to say," the manifesto sneeringly remarks, "one of the chief objects of the Premiers is the welfare of the British workman. Their anxiety is only equalled by that of the tariff-reform ing capitalist at home, who never speaks and never thinks of his share of the plunder." </para>
                            <para class="block">Thosemen were able to see very clearly the object of the Commonwealth Ministry in offering preference to England under such conditions. </para>
                            <para>In testing the disinterestedness of the colonies by a concrete instance, the manifesto refers to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin's</inline> ingenious proposal - </para>

              <inline font-style="italic">The Times</inline>condemns " the utterly parochial point of view displayed by this amazing manifesto, its entire failure to realize the stand-point of the working classes in other parts of the Empire, and the cheap sneers against the <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> of the colonies and the spokesmen Premiers." It would probably be realized that the signatories of the manifesto represented a very small fraction of their countrymen. </para>
                            <para>That, of course, has been the attitude of the English people throughout in reference to the Conference. The Prime Minister himself has told us that he was received in a magnificent manner. We hear how our representatives' were banqueted all over the country, and how they were carried about in royal carriages and motor-cars, and so forth. But that is an old trick which Great Britain has found very useful in connexion with the Indian Empire. Many times when in England I have seen Indian princes loaded with favours. I have seen examples of the way in which English statesmen practically get round men they wish to conciliate. I have known statesmen even go so fax as to give the coveted title of M.D. to a coloured prince who studied for only two years at a university, when the recognised course for any of our own people is not less than five years. That, I think, is the sort of way in which our delegates have been treated. So far as our getting what we desired is concerned, I consider that this Conference has been simply an absolute failure. We put forward a proposal that there should be preferential trade ; and with what result? Cold water was thrown upon our offer. From the first it was seen that our proposals would be declined, and all we obtained was an admission that, if we chose, we could have preferential trade with the other dependencies of Great Britain, but that, so far as Great Britain herself was concerned, the idea could not be considered for a moment. Then it was hoped by our representatives that, instead of doing business with the Colonial Office, a special department or secretariat would be organized for the purposes of the Commonwealth and other self-governing Colonies. The suggestion to that effect was also negatived, and all that the Prime Minister obtained was the grudging admission that, so far as the Colonial Office was concerned, a distinction might be made in the future between self-governing Colonies and Crown Colonies. That, in my  opinion, was a very small gain. Another proposal was that the Commonwealth should have representation on the Imperial Defence Committee. What were we offered instead? Our representatives were told that if in regard to local matters Australia required advice, and chose to send a delegate to ask for it, the Imperial Defence Committee would be very glad to give us the benefit of their knowledge; but representation on the Committee was regarded as entirely out of the question. I am perfectly justified in saying that the Prime Minister cannot congratulate himself on the result of his mission. Furthermore, I object to the political propagandist work which was carried on by certain of the Australian delegates. Did we send those delegates Home and pay their expenses in order that they might talk politics? In my opinion their action amounted to an abuse of hospitality. At any rate, I object to some of the remarks which were made by the Minister of Trade and Customs. During his visit to England he said he had not the slightest hesitation in declaring that the Labour Party was the most patriotic in Australia, while another member of the Navigation Conference said that the Labour Party was the pet of all the other parties in the Commonwealth. Yes, the Labour Party is a young tiger pet, no doubt; but, at the same time, I do not think that our delegates had any right to utilize their visit to the Home country for political propagandist work. Another statement I object to was that it is entirely owing to the efforts of the Labour Party that Australia has been kept a white man's country. We know well that the opinion of all parties in Australia is that Australia should be a white man's country ; and the remarks to which I take exception were altogether misleading to the people of the old country. The Prime Minister, before he left London, admitted that the Conference had practically been a failure ; and I shall quote from the remarks he made on that occasion. He was asked whether the results of the Conference had come up to his expectations, and he replied in these words: - </para>
                            <para>If you mean by results the resolutions which have been unanimously passed at the Conference, I. should be obliged to say no, because on several of the most important subjects we not only failed to induce an acceptance of our proposals, but even to receive a definite approach towards them. Something, it is true, was done in nearly every case ; but that something could have been accomplished by correspondence, and that is why I say that if we judge the Conference by its official resolutions we cannot claim cause for congratulations. </para>
                            <para class="block">As a matter of fact the result of all the trouble and expense that has been caused, and the delay of nearly seven months in the progress of parliamentary work, is that the Conference has proved abortive. </para>

                        <para>A  progressive scheme for the improvement of harbour and coastal defences is under consideration ; our fixed defences are receiving special attention ; the number of members of our Military Forces proceeding abroad for instruction and training has been increased ; provision for a further increase of naval and military cadets will be made ; the progress of the rifle clubs is still satisfactory ; the local production of the munitions of war will be provided for. </para>
                        <para>I would emphasize the necessity for immediately strengthening our coastal defences and properly equipping our forces. There are on the coasts of Australia numerous harbors which naturally lend themselves to the purposes of defence, and it is most important, in the interest of our commerce, that they should be protected. We must provide secure ports of refuge in which our shipping can shelter in time of war, fortifying these ports so that they may be readily defended against the attacks of an enemy. I understand, however, that the condition of our existing fortifications is unsatisfactory. Members of the Instructional Staff are told off to look after our guns and defences generally ; but they are so few in number, and the means placed at their disposal so limited, that it is extremely difficult for them to perform their duties properly. In my opinion, too, our Forces are inadequately equipped. We have been told that should war break out at any time, we could easilv make the saddles, bridles, and ammunition waggons that would be required. But it is a very dangerous thing to be short in equipment, and I therefore urge the Ministry to pay attention to this matter at once. No reference is made in the Governor-General's speech to the proposal to terminate the Naval Agreement. In New South Wales the subject is being discussed by everyone, and surprise is being expressed that it should be proposed to take such action. The Prime Minister must have been astonished at the ready manner in which his suggestion was received by the Admiralty authorities. As a matter of fact, our contribution towards the upkeep of thu Imperial Navy is a mere drop in the bucket. The sum we pay is not sufficient to commission a single man-of-war. I believe that the mother country would be glad to be rid of the agreement, because it compels her to keep more war vessels in Australian waters than her experts consider necessary here. If it were not for the Naval Agreement we should have fewer British warships in our waters. The first object of the British authorities is to make the North Sea safe, and to thoroughly fortify the coasts of Great Britain and Ireland. To improve the home defences, the Admiralty are building docks at Dover, and it is proposed to build docks on the Forth. In the far eastern waters the head-quarters of the Navy is at Singapore, and no doubt Great Britain would be glad to keep there some of the vessels that are now attached to the Australian Squadron. Therefore, it behoves us to deal with the Naval Agreement only after much consideration. The Governor-General has informed us that - </para>

Each State has its scheme of immigration, differing from the Commonwealth scheme. I understand that the New South Wales Government, which is very active in this matter, is advertising largely in Canada and in the United States of America, countries to which there is a flow of immigrants from other lands, and where, I think, our advertisements have been practically wasted. We should advertise where our efforts will produce good results. </para>

                                <para>- I am coming to that point. Great care should be taken in selecting immigrants. I was told the other day that numbers of men wearing sandals have been seen in our streets, men coming from Spain, who have been imported by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company to work in the Queensland cane fields, and that probably they will be followed by 400 or 500 others. Care should be taken to see that we get only the proper class of immigrants. All immigrants should have to pass through some office abroad where their desirability could be tested. At the present time there is a risk of importing undesirable immigrants.' One of the conditions which should be enforced is the passing of a medical examination. The Commonwealth should have a Minister of Health. America has such a Minister, and employs in every part of the world medical officers whose duty it is to examine and report on intending emigrants to America. Those upon whom they report unfavorably are refused admission to that country. The whole subject, it seems to me, should be dealt with in connexion with the establishment of Federal quarantine. That, I am sorry to say, has again been placed last but one in the list of measures for the coming session. t do not see what strong relation there is between the appointment of a High Commissioner and the proper control of immigration. In my opinion, the control of immigration is largely a matter for health authorities, and I hope we shall soon hear that a Minister of Health has been appointed. At the same time, I think that the sooner we appoint a High Commissioner the better. Whoever fills that office should not be merely a commercial agent. We should be represented in the motherland by men who will reflect credit upon' the Commonwealth. Other countries have their ambassadors, and we should choose a m,an who is eminently suited to fill the office of High Commissioner. He should be an individual with a large private income, in order that he mav be able to supplement the official salary which he will receive from the Commonwealth. He should be a m.an of good appearance and address - one who would shine in the courts of Europe. I am sure that the Minister of Trade and Customs will agree with my remarks in this connexion. He has recently had an opportunity of mixing with dukes and duchesses, and he must be aw.are of the importance which attaches to a good appearance. </para>

                                <para>- Nobody regrets that fact more than I do. I am sure that nobody is more fitted to fill it. But there are other members of this Parliament who would adequately fill the bill, and the sooner the appointment is made the better. The High Commissioner would be in a position to see th,at the Commonwealth offices in London were properly administered - a very important circumstance in itself. One matter to which I take exception in connexion with the administration of the Government during the recess has reference to the repatriation of certain Australians who were stranded in South Africa. I am given to understand that a great many of the unfortunates who have reached our shores are not Australians ,at all. I think that some inquiry should be instituted as to why these men were allowed to come here under the auspices of the Government, and to have their passages paid. Further, I fear that many of the returned Australians are not exactly what we might call " desirable " immigrants. However, I have no fault to find with the Government upon that score, because the mere fact of a man being ,an Australian was quite sufficient to arouse popular sympathy, and even if a few undesirables were introduced, the vast majority will undoubtedly prove an acquisition to the country.

                        <para class="block">I feel, as a humble member of this Parliament, although I do not see why I should call myself a humble member in view of the fact that I represent some 20,000 electors, that the Government do not take honorable members sufficiently into their confidence. We know very well that the condition of affairs in Papua recently has not given satisfaction. We .are aware that a Royal Commission was appointed to inquire into the administration of that Territory, The report of that body has been placed in our hands, and the Ministry have undertaken to give effect to many of its recommendations. Personally, I do not agree with all of those recommendations. In my opinion one of the Commissioners was totally unfitted for the work which he was called upon to perform. </para>

                                <para>- In reference to the Administrator. The Commission, after being duly constituted, visited New Guinea. It started from Port Moresby, and proceeded on an expedition from point to point until it returned to its starting place. Throughout that tour the members of the Commission met  with  no person who expressed dissatisfaction with the administration of the Territory, notwithstanding that it examined representatives of the settlers and of the miners. But upon its return to Port Moresby the administration was subjected to all sorts of unfavorable criticism. The chief objections which Judge Murray appeared to entertain to the Administrator were that he was a friend of the natives, that to a, certain extent he was opposed to the introduction of a large mining population, that he was entirely opposed to Australian sentiment, and objected to the colonization of the country by the white man. In reply, the Administrator has declared that he is not opposed to the population of the country by colonists, that he is in favour of extending its agricultural capabilities, but that he does not favour the introduction of a mining population because experience has taught him that it is not the most desirable form of population to encourage in such a country as Papua. </para>

                                <para>- No. He was an officer who two years ago was appointed Chief Justice of British ^ New Guinea. I take exception to the nature of his evidence. He has imported into it certain private conversations between himself arid the Administrator, and he lays great stress upon these after-dinner chats. He also draws conclusions from them which no person of a judicial mind could do. He endeavours to condemn the Administrator out of his own mouth, but in my opinion his charges have not been sustained. In the case of Surveyor Richmond, that officer was displaced from his position by the Administrator because of laxness in his work. The action of the Administrator was perfectly justified ; but notwithstanding that fact, Surveyor Richmond was given an opportunity of communicating with headquarters in Melbourne, and was informed that when the opportunity occurred, if he chose to revive the subject it would be inquired into. As a result, of the reply to his private communication - a communication which should have been transmitted through the Administrator to the Prime Minister -  Surveyor  Richmond was distinctly insubordinate, (and refused to comply with the orders which had been issued by his superior officer. The condition of affairs revealed by the inquiry in connexion with the Land Office was not entirely due to Captain Barton. He says that it was largely due to the action of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Richmond.</inline> Only one or two cases were disclosed in which delay had occurred owing to negligence in the Lands Department. I do not regard that as a very serious offence. I have been agitating without success for nearly four years to get a piece of land set apart for a rifle range at Singleton. How, then, can we blame an official in New Guinea if small land matters are not attended to more expeditiously ? What I object to is that the Commission recommend taking away from the natives the lands which they hold. </para>

                                <para>- The Commission recommend it in their report, and I do not know whether the Government intend to adopt their recommendation. When the Territory was taken over by the Commonwealth the natives were distinctly given to understand that the lands which they owned would be left in their possession, and that if any portion of those lands were required by the Commonwealth they would be fully compensated for them. If the Government adopt the recommendation of the Commission they will be practically saying, "We will be the judges as to what lands the natives shall utilize, and any areas in excess will become Crown lands." We all recognise that the success of Great Britain as a colonizing power has been largely due to the fact that the native tribes under her control believe implicitly in the uprightness of her rulers. A distinct pledge has been given to the natives that the land which they own shall  continue to be theirs, but if the Government act upon the recommendation of the Commission that land will be taken from them, irrespective of whether or not they are willing to part with it. I believe that the Administrator of this Territory has not received justice. When we reflect that he superseded a man who naturally expected to be appointed to that office himself, we cannot wonder that Captain Barton found it very difficult to work with him. </para>

                                <para>- Before the adjournment for luncheon, I was endeavouring to show that Captain Barton had not received justice at the hands of the present Administration. It is generally understood that Captain Barton has practically been retired from his position as Administrator of Papua, and I shall endeavour to substantiate all that I have said in regard to his treatment. I propose now to quote from the report of the Royal Commission appointed to inquire into the present conditions, including the methods of government of Papua, and the best means for their improvement. The Commission reported that, after carefully inquiring into the subject, they had come to the conclusion that they could not recommend Captain Barton's permanent retention in his present office. They further reported that it was not until their return to Port Moresby in November last that-  they were for the first time met with the long array of charges and recriminations, which will be fecund in the evidence. </para>

                        <para class="block">This goes to prove my statement that it was not until the Commission returned to Port Moresby, a hot-bed of disloyalty to the Administrator, on the part of public servants appointed to assist him, that any evidence was found against him. Since the Minister of Trade and Customs appeared to have some doubts as to the identity of the <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Murray</inline> to whom I referred, I must explain that the gentleman in question is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Hubert Plunkett Murray, who, in reply to an inquiry by the Commission, stated that he was the Chief Judicial Officer of the Territory of Papua, and had held office for two years and two months. After reading the evidence, I have not much respect for his judgment, nor can I understand how a man reared, as he must have been, in a judicial atmosphere, could have given such biased evidence as he did. </para>

                        <para>It is largely also due to a lack of sympathy with democratic ideas. I do not wish to give you to understand that he sits down and says deliberately, " I will oppose white settlement," or that he acts dishonorably, but I think that fear on the one side and sympathy on the other have led him into a position which appears to me impossible. </para>
                        <para class="block">Later on, a question arose as to the shooting of some natives who had committed depredations on a far-out white settlement. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Murray</inline> said, in his evidence - </para>

                        <para>If the statements in the letters which have been submitted to the Commissioners on this matter may be relied upon, the delay was caused in some measure owing to the insubordinate conduct of the Chief Government Surveyor, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Richmond,</inline> and his relations with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Matthews.</inline></para>

                        <para>The witness continues by saying that there has been a change since the arrival of the Commission, and " since they started talking down south in Parliament."

                        <para class="block">When such a charge is made it should not be difficult to substantiate. I shall conclude my quotations from this report by reading an extract from the evidence of the Administrator in which he vindicates his conduct. He says: - </para>
                        <para>It was not until I had read <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Murray's</inline> evidence that I became convinced of his disloyalty. I can see now that he has been disloyal from the very first. It is true that I have had doubts sometimes, but I have always succeeded in brushing them aside. Instead of doing his best to help my administration, it is evident to me now that he has seized opportunities to weaken it. I have not the least idea why he should have taken a dislike to me. I have not, as far as I know, given him cause. Judging from his social attitude, I have had every reason to suppose that his disposition towards me was friendly. He has scarcely ever failed to accept my hospitality, and I have talked to him and before h'im without reserve, and with the result that I now find that he has been carefully noting things I have said in friendly, unguarded conversation, with a view of using them to my disadvantage. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Murray</inline> has betrayed my confidence, and in the face of this he has the effrontery to say that I am not a fair-minded man. I do not like to introduce more personal reflections into this matter than I can with justice to myself avoid, but one instance goes to show that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Murray</inline> has deceived me. When the Liquor Bill was passed in Executive Council, in Port Moresby, a liquor licence-fee of <inline font-style="italic">£25</inline> was approved. I clearly recollect the conversation which then took place relating to possible amendments being moved by the non-official members to the several Bills, and as to how long it would probably take to put the Bills through. I said I did not suppose there would be any amendment proposed to the Liquor Bill, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Murray</inline> replied that he did not think it likely, unless <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Whitten,</inline> who holds several licences, tried to get the licence-fee reduced. I replied that I did not think it too high j did he? And <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Murray</inline> then, in a reassuring manner, said he did not think it any too high, and even a higher fee would not be too much. When the Bill came before the Legislative Council at Samarai, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Whitten</inline> proposed that it should be reduced to <inline font-style="italic">£15.</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Murray,</inline> without demur, supported the amendment, and it was carried. I maintain that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Murray's</inline> action in this case was due either to his inclination to hamper the Administration, or to gain popularity with a section of the public. A general review of his evidence reveals, in my opinion, a personal bias against me, and against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ballantyne.</inline> He has mixed up truth and fabrication with ingenious care, but I urge that, where spite and betrayal are two such notable features of the evidence throughout, the evidence, in my opinion, canner be considered to carry weight. The only thing which lends importance to the evidence is that it was given by the Chief Judicial Officer. Had it been given by any other person, I should not have troubled to answer it. That is all. </para>
                        <para class="block">The evidence referred to no man would expect from the lips of one who had been trained in the study and practice of the law. Had the evidence been given by any other person I should not have troubled to draw attention to it. I suppose that no good can. be done now, because the officer in question has practically left the service, on the usual terms, I suppose, of six months' leave of absence. It is only right, however, that I should1 take the opportunity to,, if possible, vindicate the character of one of the best and most useful Administrators who has ever had control of this Territory. I have nothing further to say, except to congratulate the Prime Minister on his return to his native land, and on the magnificent speeches he delivered in the old! country. </para>

                            <para>, - The House would, in my opinion have been infinitely better employed in dealing, with reform of the Tariff ; but the old, time-honoured custom of an Address-in-Reply, which I should be very pleased to see abandoned, enables us to refer to questions- for the consideration of which another opportunity might not occur. I regret that the health of the Prime Minister has not enabled him to give the House a <inline font-style="italic">resume</inline> of what took place in the old country. Under the circumstances, I am confined for my information as to the proceedings of the great Imperial Conference, to what is contained in the speech of the Governor-General, which states that, in consequence of the gathering, a much better understanding has been arrived at. If that means that the people of the old country have a better understanding of the great resources, the power, and the future of the Commonwealth, I am quite satisfied. But if it means that a better understanding has been arrived at between the Colonial Prime Ministers and the Colonial Office, the representatives of which seemed to dominate the Conference, as to the creation of a new body, I am entirely with the  deputy  leader of the Opposition in trusting that we shall not allow any of the autonomous powers we possess to be curtailed. I give the Prime Minister every praise for the way in which he endeavoured to make the resources of Australia known, and I am pleased also to think that the Minister of Trade and Customs seems to have impressed on the people of the old country that Australia is a  power in the Empire, and that he would not play a secondary part, but claimed an equal footing with all the other representatives invited to the Conference. I find that in regard to the Navigation Conference also a good understanding was arrived at. If that means that the Imperial Government now recognises that we have the right to deal with out own coastal trade in what manner we think best I  am  satisfied that the Minister of Trade and Customs has done good work. That honorable gentleman talks about providing regulations to deal with oversea shipping which engages in our coastal trade. But I contend now as I have contended before, that this matter will never be effectively dealt with until we follow the splendid example of America, in seeing that not a single passenger or pound of cargo is carried from one Australian port to another except in Australian ships. I am delighted to see the Treasurer in his place, because I have something to say of importance, not only to the House, but to him. According to the Governor-General's Speech it is recognised that there is urgent necessity for an amendment of our Electoral Act, and I am sure every honorable member will agree as to the correctness of that view. I was rather astonished two days after the last Commonwealth elections to find the Acting Minister of Home Affairs congratulating the Chief Electoral Officers of the Commonwealth on the efficiency they had displayed in the organization and conduct of the huge electoral machine. </para>

                                <para>- I have no cause of complaint personally, because the electoral machine did not have to operate in my case, and I hope it never will. If the electoral machine had been operated honestly as it ought to have been, I am quite sure that I should have had at least one other Labour colleague in this Parliament ; but I am in hopes now that his place will be satisfactorily filled. If we are to have an amending Electoral Bill, I trust the Government will make all in,quiry that is possible as regards the defects in existing legislation, and see that these defects are remedied. I hope the Government will go further and ascertain whether some of the blunders which were made were not criminal; because, so far as my experience goes, I am quite prepared to say that some were criminal. In the case of the vacancy which has been declared by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Barton, I am quite satisfied, after my experience in connexion with the election, that something radically wrong, if not criminal, occurred ; and the case ought to be inquired into. I acted as scrutineer in the recount, and dealt with all the votes in my own district ; and in not one single instance did the recount tally with the first count. There were differences of twenty-one votes, nineteen votes, eight votes, and so on, and there was the enormous discrepancy in Hindmarsh at one polling-booth of ninety-six votes. </para>

                                <para>- And I am satisfied that thousands of votes were lost in South Australia through the same blunder. The chief blunder was actually a blunder, but, at the same time, we must take care to provide that no such blunder is possible in the future. I have before me the results of the first and second counts at the Senate elections in South Australia, and, as I have already indicated, I find that the differences were very considerable. In the Angas district, in not one single instance did the second count tally with the first, and the  same  condition of affairs prevailed in nearly all the other districts. In Hindmarsh, the difference represented ninety-six votes lost bv <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crosbie</inline> and 101 votes gained by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Playford,</inline> and other differences were thirteen, eight, and fourteen. The South Australian electoral system is so simple that I am glad to say we have never had a protest in regard to the conduct of elections. </para>

There was one protest in a case of a State election, and in that instance, the returning officer had burnt the votes in the same way as occurred in the Angas district during the Commonwealth elections. </para>

                                <para>- Yes. In the ca&lt;e of the State election to which I have referred, the burning of the votes made it impossible to say how the election really stood. As to the burning of the votes in the Commonwealth election, I do not know what action the Minister of Home Affairs proposes to take. But the Minister was to blame, the Chief Electoral Officer was to blame, and those officers who received instructions from the higher officials were in some cases to blame, and in other cases were blameless. </para>

If a similar course were adopted in the appointment of returning officers as is usual in the case of the Civil Service, I am sure that not one in fifty would pass a satisfactory examination as to his duties. I may say that the Chief Electoral Officer of South Australia wrote to the Minister of Home Affairs complaining that it would be impossible to carry out the instructions; but. of course, nothing was done. , </para>

                                <para>- Because I believe the Minister himself did not understand the difficulties of carrying out a Commonwealth election. If the matter had been left to the Commonwealth Electoral Officer of South Australia there would have been no trouble in the conduct of the elections, and I ask honorable members to peruse the South Australian Electoral Act. Our State elections were open to all the abuses that have been exposed throughout the Commonwealth, but we were able to rectify these; and I have no doubt that if the Commonwealth Act had been based on the South Australian Act there would have been no ground of complaint. We find that the returning officers, about six months before the polling, were asked to send to the Chief Electoral Officer a return giving the names of the poll-clerks and of all officers who were to be engaged at the elections. Of course, that was an utterly impossible task. If the returning officers had had the conduct of the elections they «would have seen that the whole of the votes were counted at one centre, and they would have been responsible. Instead, however, the work was intrusted to postmasters throughout the length and breadth of the country, who had never conducted an election in their lives, and who really could not agree as to what was an informal or formal vote. Consequently, I, for one, am not surprised at the confusion which resulted. </para>

                                <para>- Yes. If one wants good work he must pay good wages, and should expect only bad work for low wages. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blundell</inline> was compelled to test the validity of the election, and in connexion with the case had to pay ^15 as witnesses' fees to the returning officers who were compelled to appear before the Judge to explain their blunders. Surely the Government will refund that money. I never heard of anything more unjust than that a candidate who had suffered from the blunders of the returning officers should have to pay the officers to appear in Court to explain them. As the Judge said, had the law here been the same as the English law, not only would they have had to pay the expense of attending the Court, but they might have been mulcted in the whole of the expenses of the election. Yet I have far more serious charges to make against Ministers in regard to the conduct of the elections than have been levelled against any of the departmental officers. I have here a copy of a newspaper called the <inline font-style="italic">Patriot,</inline> issued in Western Australia. </para>

The statement appears on the front page that the publication is registered at the General Post Office, Perth, for transmission by post as a newspaper. I hope that the Treasurer will explain why it was that, after thousands of copies had been transmitted through the post, an acquaintance of mine who went to Messrs. Sands and McDougall, the printers, and asked them for copies of Nos. 1, 2 and 3 - the copy which I have here is No. 3 - was informed that they knew nothing of the issue of Nos. 1 and 2, and that No. 3 could not be had. He then asked if he could buy a copy at any news agency, and the printers were not able to tell him where a copy could be bought. He tried several agencies without obtaining a copy. </para>

When my friend could not obtain a copy of the publication in Perth, he went to the General Post Office there, to ascertain if it had been registered as a newspaper, and was told that it was not so registered in Perth. This is a matter to which the Postmaster-General should give attention. On the 7 th December he made further inquiries, and two hours afterwards the publication was registered. But copies had already been distributed through the post. </para>

The candidates for this House were the present member for Fremantle and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Thurston,</inline> a free-trader who stood in opposition to my honorable colleague, the able representative for Perth, and was supported by the pretended protectionist Treasurer. These are the tactics to which the Treasurer resorted after having been kept in office by members of the Labour Party, who could not be expected to stand behind him at the election after having found him out. Four of the candidates were not returned, so perhaps the right honorable gentleman will have the pleasure and privilege of assisting them on another occasion. </para>

I wish to remind honorable members that under the Electoral Act the expenses which may be incurred by a candidate for a seat in the House of Representatives are limited to £100. As a printer I know that it must have cost a very large sum to broadcast a publication such as this, and I want the Treasurer to explain how it was possible to transmit it through the post in thousands without exceeding' the maximum expenditure to which I have referred. The Postmaster-General is bound to tell the House how it came about that the Deputy Postmaster-General of Western Australia, after declaring that the publication was not registered as a newspaper, registered it for transmission through the post a fortnight after its issue, although no later copy of it was printed. </para>

                                <para>- I think this House has a- right to know what it paid. It is a question in which the revenue of the Commonwealth is concerned. If the Treasurer asserts that it paid the full rate he is impaled upon the horns of a dilemma, because it is obvious that his expenses must have exceeded .£100. </para>

                                <para>- I will read just one or two extracts from this marvellous publication, of which the Treasurer thinks so highly, and the production of which cost him nothing. I ought to say, that if it be possible to register this newspaper, it is time we had a censor appointed to see that honest statements are put before the public. I find in it a heading which conveys the information that " <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest has been alone for six years." </para>

                                <para>- I know that the statement is thoroughly in accord with the opinions expressed by the Treasurer at various meetings, and if the right honorable gentleman himself did not write it, the reporter responsible for it wrote exactly what was in the Treasurer's mind. I wonder what the right honorable gentleman has to say in regard to his pet subject - the transcontinental railway to Western Australia. Every member of the Labour Party has fought as hard for that measure as has the Treasurer. This publication, I believe, was broadcasted at the public expense. </para>

This is the kind of literature that the Treasurer, permitted to be broadcasted throughout Western Australia, and I say that it evidences the unfair tactics which were adopted by our opponents. Had similar tactics been followed by the Labour Party, my colleagues and myself would have been found denouncing them from one end of the Commonwealth to the other.

The labour unions have already fourteen members out of thirty-six in the Senate, and during the coming elections they not only expect to retain all  their  present seats, but have been for months making desperate efforts to capture five additional seats, which will place them in a majority, and enable them to dominate and control every legislative enactment passed by the House of Representatives. </para>

We are under the domination of our electorates and of nothing else. We are selected, not by any union, but by the whole of the people who choose to sign the platform of the Labour Party. </para>

                                <para>- I do not feel annoyed in the slightest degree at interjections so long as they do not amount to interruptions. But I do think it is my duty to show honorable members - particularly those who are here for the first time - the kind of tactics which are sometimes resorted to by old and experienced politicians. I hope that whatever may be our political differences, we shall always win our seats by fair fighting. I feel that some members of the party with which I am associated have had to win their seats despite unfair fighting from quarters from which they might least be expected. As the Treasurer has retired from the Chamber, I intend to deal with only one or two more statements which are contained in the publication to which I have previously directed attention. That publication, the Deputy Postmaster-General of Western Australia declared was' not registered as a newspaper. Subsequently one of my friends instituted inquiries and found that it had been so registered. I believe that many thousand copies of it have been transmitted through the post at newspaper rates, and that consequently the revenue has been defrauded in addition to an unfair advantage having been taken of certain candidates. </para>

                                <para>- Because I am conversant with the subject upon which I am talking. I do not know what obtained in Queensland, but I am sure that some of my colleagues will be able to supply the information asked for by the honorable member for Capricornia. I find in this paper, which was scattered broadcast, many statements designed to mislead the electors. Why should attempts be made to mislead them? Why is it not possible for us to place our honest views* against those honestly held by our opponents? Under the headings of "Incorrect Assertions," " Baseless Claims to Legislative Work," I find the statement that in the first Parliament the House was divided as follows: - Protectionists and supporters of the Ministry, 33 ; free-traders and supporters of the Opposition, 25 ; Labour members, 16; and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline></para>

                                <para>- We undoubtedly introduced new principles. As the Treasurer has seen fit to retire from the House, I shall refrain from making any further reference to him. I wish now to say a word or two with respect, not to the administration of the Government, but to something which the Government should inquire into. Although we have a Public Service Commissioner, with an inspector in each of the States, the greatest dissatisfaction prevails throughout the Commonwealth in regard to the administration of the Service. I am surprised and disappointed to find that men who have been charged with serious offences in different parts of the Commonwealth, and have been dismissed from the Service, have been able, with certain influence, to secure reinstatement, and even to secure promotion to high positions. I know of one case in New South Wales where an official was actually arrested for theft. </para>

                                <para>- As my information is second-hand, I shall ask the Minister to make independent inquiry. I believe that the Postmaster-General knows something about the case. I am informed that a public officer, who had been arrested for theft, and against whom there was a suspicion of other offences, was not only placed in charge of a suburban post-office, but was ultimately promoted to the position of inspector. This is only one of a number of cases that have been brought under my notice. Similar cases have occurred in South Australia. </para>

                                <para>- If the honorable member casts a glance at the map he will see that we have in South Australia more land than there is within the New South Wales borders. I am not permitted to say anything to the Public Service Commissioner as to the unrest in the Service, but he must know full well that dissatisfaction -exists when a man arrested for theft is promoted over the heads of honest officers. Reference has been made during the debate to the Northern Territory, and, whilst I do not propose to discuss in detail the agreement for its transfer to the Commonwealth, since it will be submitted to us later on, I feel it necessary to deal with some of the criticism that has been levelled at the Government. The honorable member for Kalgoorlie was very much- concerned because of a statement in one of a series of excellent articles in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> dealing with the Northern Territory. I think that the writer of those articles takes too pessimistic a view of the position in regard to the locked-up lands. It is true that .86,295 square miles have been leased for a period of forty-two years, but I would remind honorable members that  the  area of the </para>

                        <para class="block">Territory is 526,620 square miles, or 335,116,800 acres. It will thus be seen that a comparatively small part of the Territory has yet been leased. I admit that the land so held at present includes some of the best to be found there; but when honorable members say that  the  whole of it has been locked up for forty-two years, they, like the writer of the articles to which I have referred, are labouring under a misapprehension. The position is that, on notice being given and compensation paid, agricultural lands may be resumed at any time after the expiration of ten years from the date of the issue of the lease. We are not going within a year or two to settle hundreds of thousands of people in the Territory, and I would draw attention to the fact that four or five years hence much of the land that has been leased by the Government of South Australia can be resumed. The position, therefore, is not nearly so bad as it would appear at first sight. If the lands locked up are really suitable, as I believe they are, for closer settlement - for the growth of tropical products - they are of value, and in the event of their not being used, it would be only right to impose a reasonable amount of taxation in respect of their unimproved value. If that course were adopted, the bulk of the land would soon fall back into the hands of the Government. I have no desire to prolong the debate, but wish to refer briefly to the necessity of appointing a High Commissioner. In view of what has been said as to some of the Commonwealth delegates at the recent Conferences in London, I sincerely trust that the Prime Minister was misrepresented in regard to his utterances with respect to the Labour Party. It has been mentioned, both in the House and out of it, that the Treasurer is likely to be appointed as High Commissioner of the Commonwealth. I hope, however, that no appointment will be made until the Government have submitted to Parliament the name of the gentleman whom they propose to nominate. I am anxious to see, not only that the Labour Party is not misrepresented by the High Commissioner, but that such an appointment will be made as will insure fair treatment to every section in the Parliament. If a selection were made from some whose fitness for the office has been suggested, we should not secure that fair play to which we are entitled. Every member of this House has declared his approval of the principle of old-age pensions, and I  am disappointed to find that in His Excellency's Speech the subject is dismissed in a mere phrase - </para>

                        <para class="block">As a member of the dominant party - the party uppermost, both in regard to its numbers and its position - I feel that it will be our duty to consider how long we shall support the smaller party unless it is prepared to take action towards the establishment of a Federal system of pensions. If the Government are in earnest in their oft-repeated expressions of approval of certain principles included in the programme of the Labour Party, they must give us some proof. </para>

                                <para>- I am sorry to say that we have been unable to squeeze much out of them. The Opposition have said that, although there is not much of a socialistic character in the proposals of the Ministry itself, the Labour Party can secure its support for any socialistic measure. No one has been able, however, to point to one socialistic measure introduced by a Labour member and carried with the assistance of the Government. Those who think that much can be done by private members will find, on placing their notices of motion on the business-paper, that they are lamentably mistaken'. It is high time the Government took a stand, and gave a tangible0 expression of their sympathy, not only with the aged poor, but with the sick poor. We all know how funds devoted to charity are wasted. On an average the object of charity receives <inline font-style="italic">j£i,</inline> while the distribution costs about <inline font-style="italic">£5 ;</inline> at any rate, that is how the system worked out in connexion with the Victorian Humane Society. That being so, charity organisations should be relieved of a great deal of the work they now perform, and some relief should also be afforded to those generous-hearted citizens who do not make full inquiry into the charities to which they contribute. For those reasons I am prepared to go as far as possible towards compelling the Government to carry out what every section of the House is in favour of, namely, a Commonwealth system of old-age pensions. I desire to say one word in regard to the Federal Capital site. I have no preference, or, rather, I had no preference, for one site over another in New South Wales when  I  entered this Parliament. But having, viewed the several sites, I believe I honestly did my duty, not only to this Parliament but to New, South Wales, when I voted in favour of Dalgety. I did not cast that vote because I considered Dalgety to be the best site, but the site I preferred having been rejected, I regarded the territory now favoured by me as the second best. On looking into the matter I find that Dalgety, which has been accepted by this Parliament, was the very site offered by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers,</inline> the Premier of New South Wales. It is the duty of honorable members opposite, and also of members on this side, who are now opposed to Dalgety, to tell us what we have not been told up to the present, namely, what has led them to change their opinions on this question. The site of Dalgety, it appears, was offered by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers</inline> some time ago, when the matter was under discussion. </para>

                                <para>- Both the honorable member for Parramatta and the honorable member for Lang, when the question was put to them, failed to explain which site the Premier of New South Wales now desires to have chosen. It is of no use appealing to me on this question, unless I am told something definite. I am satisfied, so far, with Dalgety, although, as I said before, I voted for it simply as the second best site. </para>

                                <para>- No ; but I contend that we should not have anything less than 900 square miles. The honorable member for Fawkner wishes to save the Commonwealth some millions of money by postponing the selection of the site for ten years, and, in the meantime, have the Seat of Government removed to Sydney. But the sooner we fix the Capital the sooner we shall save money to the taxpayers ; that is, if we carry out the idea favoured by the majority of the members of the last Parliament, and I trust by a majority of the members of this. Parliament, that none of the Commonwealth lands shall be alienated. If that policy be carried out there will result a revenue sufficient to relieve the country of the entire cost of the Commonwealth Government. </para>

The people of New South Wales would reap the greatest benefit from the trade which would result, and, at the same time, the revenue derived would be sufficient to cover the cost of government. I do not desire to prolong the debate, because I shall have an opportunity later <inline font-style="italic">tn</inline> deal with the other subjects mentioned in His Excellency's Speech. I trust that very soon we shall be actively engaged in a work which is of the greatest importance to Australia, namely, the reform of the Federal Tariff. </para>

                            <para>.- Honorable members, who have already spoken, have set a good example in making their remarks brief ; and that example I intend to follow, because I have no desire to unduly trespass on the valuable time of the House. In the first place, if I am not considered too presumptuous, or as lecturing honorable members, I should like to say that, in my opinion, we have arrived at a critical period in our Federal history. Seven years have not passed since Federation was inaugurated, and, unfortunately - whether justifiably or not I am not arguing - a feeling of grave dissatisfaction has spread over more than one State. In fact, it is freely declared that if the question were again put to the people of New South Wales and other States at the present time, there would be an overwhelming majority against Federation. </para>

                                <para>- I am afraid I cannot agree with that view. If such a feeling exists it is our duty to recognise it, and, acting in sympathy with the States, to endeavour to observe in every particular the spirit of what we are - a Federation. We have also to recognise that the last general election was fought, not on the Tariff, but on the question of Socialism <inline font-style="italic">v.</inline> anti-Socialism. It appears, however, that the Tariff is in the way of other business ; and, therefore, I for one should be exceedingly glad to see the Government introduce their Tariff proposals with all expedition. I hope the House will take a reasonable view, and assist in getting the Tariff out of the way as quickly as possible so that other measures may be proceeded with. If that course he followed, it is possible that there may be then found in the House a party strong enough to form a Government with sufficient legitimate followers - and by that I mean followers who do not lend their support from any ulterior motives- </para>

                                <para>- I hope there may be found a Government with sufficient followers of its own to pass the measures which they introduce, and that those followers will be in close touch, and see eye to eye with the Administration. If we should succeed in bringing about that desirable state of affairs we shall be able to freely congratulate ourselves on reestablishing, or perhaps, establishing for the first time in our Federal history what is known as responsible government. That should be our object, and the sooner it is attained the sooner Australia will be satisfied with its Federal Government, and will confidently look for good legislative work. When the Tariff is introduced, as I hope it may te soon, I intend to take a free hand, and treat each proposal on what I consider its merits - to vote for an increase or decrease of duty, as either course may commend itself to my judgment. </para>

                        <para class="block">This paragraph refers to our present abounding prosperity. If we are prosperous, and that fact is due to remarkable expansion in local production and in the export trade, I cannot see how the Ministry can expect any great increases in the present Tariff. For myself, I think that owing to the necessities of our peculiar circumstances in Australia, the Tariff should first and foremost be one that will produce the revenue required to carry on the work of the Commonwealth. </para>

                                <para>- It is because I desire to avoid direct taxation that I am so firm on the point that we should obtain all the revenue we need from the Customs. My opinion is that the Commonwealth should riot resort to land taxation until actually forced by circumstances to do so. The spirit of the Federal bond is that only in circumstances of urgency should the land be taxed for the purpose of producing Commonwealth revenue. If the spirit of the bond be broken in this direction, then I am afraid a precedent may be formed for breaking it in many other directions. At any rate, I am opposed to the Commonwealth undertaking to tax the land except under such necessitous circumstances as I have indicated. </para>

                                <para>- Once the Tariff has been disposed of, this Parliament will be able to turn its attention to the fostering of immigration, and we may then, within a few years, expect a steady flow of immigrants only too ready to exchange the hard conditions which accompany the congestion of population in the old world for the freer life of Australia, where their energy and self-reliance will give them better opportunities to improve their position. The Governor-General made reference to the holding of " two very influential Conferences " in London. I do not know what some honorable members expected from the Imperial Conference; but I think we have got as much as we could reasonably look for. When next an Imperial Conference is held, four years hence, the delegates to it will assemble as the partners in a large firm, or the representatives of nations which are on an equality. That is a step in advance which is the natural outcome of the labours of past Conferences, and especially of the last Conference. The Prime Minister deserves the thanks of Australia for the excellent manner in which he represented the Commonwealth in London. I do not agree with the policy which he advocated for the establishment of preferential trade, or in many other matters ; but he bore himself so well as our representative, and gave us such a splendid advertisement, that we owe him our thanks. Undoubtedly he was playing a part which fitted him like a glove; but he played it so well, taking such full advantage of the opportunities presented to him, that he did admirable service. Owing to his eloquence, courtesy, and firmness, his visit has done much to restore the good relations which existed between Australia and the mother country prior to Federation. I am glad that the proposal to make the Conference an executive body was not pushed. In view of the cordial relations between Australia, the mother country, and other parts of the Empire, we should let things develop gradually and naturally. In this way alone can we strengthen the ties that bind us together. The Tariff having been dealt with, I hope that whatever Government may be in power will do its best to deal with the subjects which the people thought would be speedily settled as the outcome of Federation. At the present time the country is extremely prosperous, statistics showing that our production now is greater per head of population than that of any other country. This prosperity is not due to our legislation, but to the beneficent seasons which we have had, and the consequent bountiful harvests. Still, we should do our best to encourage the immigration of the right class of people, to further develop our territory, and to increase our production. But I do not think that the Commonwealth should be in too great a hurry to undertake large developmental or experimental works. I represent the smallest State of the Union, and I say that the interests of the smaller States should be studied when proposed Commonwealth expenditure is being considered. It is true that the Tasmanian finances show a surplus of ,£70,000 this year ; but that is a small amount compared with the Victorian surplus of £800,000 and the New South Wales surplus, which exceeds £1,000,000. The surpluses of the other States have come about more naturally than that of Tasmania, which has practically been wrung from the people. Our direct taxation is so heavy that our people cannot bear very much more. Therefore, the Commonwealth should not enter upon works whose expense will be too heavy a burden upon the smaller </para>

                        <para class="block">States. The proposed transfer of the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth is likely, if agreed upon, to cost us a vast amount of money. I admit that in its present undeveloped and undefended state the position of the Northern Territory is calculated to give the Minister of Defence great anxiety. But if the Territory were transferred from South Australia to the Commonwealth, would its development proceed at a faster rate? If only the question of defence has to be considered, some more satisfactory method of dealing with the matter than that embodied in the proposed agreement should be found. I admit that South Australia has had a heavy task, and has done good service in holding and administering the Northern Territory. But the terms of the proposed transfer are unjust to the smaller States, and I hope that better terms will be agreed upon. The Territory having been taken over, we shall have to face the serious problem of how best to develop it. There is great difference of opinion as to whether white men can work in the tropics without ruining their health. In my opinion, the balance of evidence shows that they are not able to perform work continuously there without injuring their constitutions. However, when the matter comes before us, I hope that a satisfactory arrangement will be made, whereby South Australia will be relieved of her burden, and the position of the Territory improved without unfairness to the remaining States. The mismanagement of the recent mail contract reflects discredit on Ministers, since it shows that they have not displayed the business capacity to be expected from men in their position. From what I read in the newspapers, the Minister of Trade and Customs would have liked to terminate the contract some time ago. That should have been done, and new tenders called for as soon as the Government found that the syndicate was playing a game with them. In paragraph 8 of the Governor-General's Speech it is stated that - </para>

                        <para class="block">To deal with the last-mentioned matter first, I should like to know what procedure the Government intend to adopt before expressing any opinion on the proposal to produce munitions of war locally. As to the progressive scheme of harbor and coastal defences referred to, I doubt whether the provision of a small torpedo fleet will be sufficient. It might be a good thing to provide such a fleet as an auxiliary to the Imperial squadron. That was suggested by the Government last session. The consideration of this matter opens up the question of the Naval Agreement, and of the establishment of an Australian Navy.  1  am sorry that we have not the benefit of the real opinion of the Ministry in regard to the suggested termination of the Naval Agreement. When the Imperial Conference was sitting in London, a cablegram was published in the Australian papers to the effect that the Prime Minister had practically given notice of his intention to terminate that agreement. I read that information with the greatest surprise - indeed, it came as a shock to me - because it is not many years since the honorable and learned gentleman did all that he could to induce Australia to enter into the agreement. Only last session he spoke most eloquently in favour of it, and consequently I was very much astonished to learn that he had notified the people of England that Australia would rather spend upon local defences the paltry sum which it now contributes towards the maintenance of the Imperial Squadron in these waters. If a referendum were to be taken to-morrow, I am satisfied that the Prime Minister would not find his view supported by the people of Australia. Popular feeling is decidedly in favour of the continuance of the present agreement. For my own part, I think that it forms a splendid link between the Commonwealth and the motherland, and affords us a far better protection than we could hope for from anything in the shape of an Australian Navy. </para>

                                <para>- I have already said that there may be something beneficial in the proposal of the Ministry to build small torpedo boats and vessels for our coastal defence as an auxiliary to the squadron already in our waters. In the matter of defence, the British Navy is practical I \ our sole protection. Our vast commerce throughout the Empire absolutely imposes upon us the necessity for maintaining the supremacy of the seas. I cannot see how we can insure that supremacy unless we keep up an extensive Navy - a Navy that shall at least be equal to the combined navies of any other two powers. If we do that, we can protect our trade routes and insure the safe passage of our great ocean carriers. If Australia wishes to do more in the way of naval defence, let her increase the subsidy which is at present payable under the Naval Agreement. Our contribution is a mere pittance compared with the benefits which we derive from that agreement. It represents only about is. per head of our population as against a tax of 18s. per head on the people of the motherland. ' Without the Navy, our Empire would soon crumble to pieces. We have now the greatest Empire that the world has known, and it is not only our privilege but our bounden dutv to uphold it. </para>

Paragraph 13 of  His  Excellency's Speech refers to the payment of income tax by Federal officers. I do not pretend to know exactly what is meant by it, but I do hope the Government intend to see that Federal officers shall ,pay State income tax. I cannot see why the individual who has the good luck to hold a Federal position should be above the law in this or any other respect. Paragraph 19 commands my approbation, inasmuch as it promises the introduction of a system of preferential voting. If the Government can submit an effective measure in that direction they will be doing a good work. Every honorable member who represents a constituency should represent a majority of the electors in it. If the Ministry address themselves seriously to the task, I think they will be able to devise a scheme of preferential voting which will insure the rule of the majority. If they do so I shall be very glad to give it support. I shall not detain the House at any greater length, but, before I resume my seat, I must thank honorable members for the very patient hearing which they have extended to me. Of course, I do not expect such mild treatment upon future occasions. </para>

                            <para>- I quite agree with the honorable member. I suppose that when I become a thorough protectionist I shall expect a clause in the agreement providing that the ships must be built in Australia, but I have not yet come quite as far as that. I trust the Postmaster-General will be lynx-eyed on this occasion, and will see that it is one of the terms of the new agreement that the ships shall be docked in Australia. </para>
