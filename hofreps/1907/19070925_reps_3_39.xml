            <para>- I wish to know from the Prime Minister if he will cause inquiries to be made into the boycotting of Western Australian stock by South Australia and some of the other States. Camels were imported into Western Australia from India which were supposed to be infected with the disease known as surrah, and as the authorities of South Australia, Tasmania, and, I think, other States, seem to be under the impression that that disease is communicable to horses, the importations into those States not only of Western Australian live stock, but even of hides and  skins, including &#39;kangaroo skins, has been prohibited. As a result of the prohibition, Western Australian racehorses will be unable to compete .in forthcoming races in the eastern States, such as the Melbourne Cup. As Western Australia has a substantial grievance in connexion with this &#34;treatment, and the Commonwealth will shortly have control of quarantine, I ask the Prime Minister to ascertain whether there is. any justification for the prohibition? </para>

It is for honorable members to say whether the Tariff schedule shall or shall not be discussed earlier than next week. So much time has hitherto been occupied in talk that the Government are not responsible for the delay which has occurred. I assure the honorable member for Wimmera that it is not the desire of the Government to delay the consideration of the Tariff.

            <para>.-I am very sorry that my remarks were cut short last night, because I did not intend to occupy any length of time, and, indeed, I do not wish to make any prolonged remarks to-day. I know that honorable members, are anxious to reach the Tariff, and in that anxiety I share. As to the item before us, I am sure honorable members in all parts of the House will agree with the proposal of the Government. I have never heard a word said in opposition to the establishment . of a small arms and ammunition factory within these walls when a project of the kind has been advocated during the time devoted to private members&#39; business. Ever since I entered the Federal Parliament I have been convinced that one of the first steps that should have been taken by the Commonwealth was . towaxds the establishment of a factory of this kind. My anxiety that we should manufacture our own small arms, including bayonets, and also our own ammunition, was caused by the fact that during the South African War, Great Britain, when it was found that she could not herself supply all the rifles required, appealed in vain to France and Germany for assistance in this connexion. Although their arsenals were in full swing no war materiel whatever could be procured fron either of the two countries I have mentione 3. Both positively refused to supply Great Britain ; in fact these countries declined to have any dealings of the kind so long as the South African War lasted. Thisjshould be sufficient to show honorable members the necessity far setting, our house in order and making arrangements for our own Jupply of small arms and ammunition. One day last week we agreed to a vote inorder to secure 25,000 bayonets ;but Ipoint out . that the officer, who was sent bythe British Government to watch events in Japan, has recommended that bayonets be dispensed with in the Imperial Army Before any expenditure isentered upon in reference to bayonets, the Government ought to fully investigate the matter; because it will be of no use our incurring liabilities for the supply of bayonetsunless the Imperial Forces arearmed with the same weapon. The Minister of Defence told us last night that this, item of&#163;32,000, which involves an ultimate expenditure of &#163;65,000, is only for the purppe of securing machinery. Why did thegovernment not tell honorable membersthat this item was for machinery, and not for a small arms factory? How can wi have a factory without a building? </para>

              <para>- I do not think that  &#163;10,000  would be sufficient to provide a building, seeing that much of the machinery will have to be placed, on solid concrete blocks, which will mean a heavy expenditure. The Minister seems to have in his mind a cheap building of galvanized iron ; but I hope that a proper structure will be provided. I have no hesitation in expressing the opinion that the best place for a small arms and ammunition&#187;factory is Lithgow, in New South Wales. In this matter, there ought to be no provincialism ; and I, as a Queenslander, suggest Lithgow as the proper place, because all the material necessary is at hand, and the existing railway communication will make distribution throughout the Commonwealth possible at little expense. In my opinion, the Minister ought to make a statement to the House, telling us definitely the class of building it is intended to erect, and what the estimated expenditure is. I dp not think that a galyanized-iron building would be good enough, especially if we undertake to manufacture ammunition. </para>

              <para>- As the Minister says, that is by the way. But itill I am of opinion that honorable mlmbers ought to be given some  information,  seeing that we are embarking ona thoroughly new enterprise. We oughtto.benefit from the experience of older countries, and avoid defects that are there to be found. The Minister has told us that the plant it is proposed to procure willbe capable of turning out fifty rifles a day of eight hours, or  150  rifles in a day of three shifts ; and for a peace establishment I should think that thatwas quite sufficient. If not, however, theplant may be duplicated or extended. One of the strongest points in favour of theestablishment of a factory is that the rifts can be made cheaper here than they can be imported. </para>

              <para>- I do not see why our rifles should not be as effective if . we have proper machinery. As to the interjection by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, some people in this city seem to have an idea that nothing imported is good. The fact . that rifles can be made more cheaply in Australia is sufficient argument to insure the acceptance of this item. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton once described Australia as a &#34; brand new nation.&#34; But I found that if a rifle required any repairs, even though it were only a new sight, it had to be sent either to England or America. Fancy a &#34; nation &#34; that could not put a sight on a rifle, or re-rifle a barrel ! Notwithstanding that the . Government have stolen my thunder by placing this proposal before us, I feel as proud as any man could to think that the agitation I started when I first entered the Chamber has borne such good fruit in so short a time. </para>

            <para>. - With the idea of establishing a small arms factory, honorable members on all sides of the House are in accord. It is very desirable that we should have establishments in our midst where war materiel of the kind can be made, because it is obvious that in time of trouble we should run serious risks if we had to depend entirely on over-sea supplies. When we are told that rifles can be manufactured locally, and more cheaply than imported rifles can be purchased, I presume consideration has been given to the fact that the most approved weapons are subject to patent rights. </para>

There is only one other point that&#39; I desire to bring under the notice of the Committee. I should like to know whether the destination of this, proposed expenditure may be diverted to some other purpose not specifically mentioned in the Estimates. The item reads &#34; Small Arms Factory, &#163;32,000,&#34; and I understand that the total of &#163;65,000, of which this forms a part, will be required, not for a building, but for machinery to be used in the factory. </para>

            <para>. - I propose to withdraw this item. I have already explained, in reply to the honorable member for Corio, that the question relating to the supply of cordite, although as imperative as is that regarding the establishment of a small arms factory, is infinitely more intricate. Explosives are in a transition stage. Had any one asked a military expert a year or two ago whether cordite would keep, he would have received a reply in the affirmative ; but there are now serious doubts on the point, or, at least, the reply would be made with qualifications. </para>

              <para>- We have either to store our explosives or to manufacture them, and since there is grave doubt as to the keeping qualities of cordite, we must be in a position to manufacture our own supplies. The honorable member for Newcastle has referred to one of the complexities of the situation. From time to time statements have appeared in the press regarding the use of different explosives. This is a matter relating to the work of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hake,</inline> Chief Inspector of Explosives, who is one of the ablest chemists in Australia.

            <para>.- I should like to draw attention to the difficulties that have recently arisen in regard to the supply of defective ammunition. Recent experiments made in one of the States have proved that Australian -made ammunition is very defective. I should like to know whether this item is to be confined merely to the manufacture of cordite, or whether it is intended to manufacture cartridges in the factory to be established. </para>

            <para>.- I trust that the Minister will not tie down the Department to the manufacture of cordite alone. If we are to have a small arms and ammunition factory we should be able to make not only cordite, but other explosives. In England there is  a  laboratory where the flame qualities of powder intended for use in gassy coal mines are tested, and only that which is placed on the permit list may be employed. Inspectors in Australia are now restricting mineowners to the use of powders that appear on the English permit list; but I would point out that since the legislation on the subject relates only to powder used in Great Britain, there is nothing to prevent an inferior article being supplied in the Commonwealth. I believe that the States laboratories have been undertaking some work in the direction of testing such powders, and I think that in connexion with the Commonwealth Sma.II Arms Factory we should have a laboratory where reliable tests could be made. Another point is that cordite is not the only explosive used in rifle ammunition. I believe that in the Russo-Japanese war the Japanese used an explosive known as Shimose, and no one can saw when an Australian inventor may come forward with a superior explosive. If we intend to establish, an ammunition factory, I fail to see why we should restrict this item to cordite. We should be in a position to encourage any Australian inventor of explosives. </para>

This is a matter of interest not only to coal miners, but to those engaged in mining of every description. The appalling mortality in the deep mines of Victoria is, in mv opinion, largely due to the fumes given off by the explosives now used. </para>

I have brought this matter up every year that I have been a member of this Parliament. It is more important that we should have a cordite factory than that we should have a factory for the manufacture of small arms and ammunition. I am very pleased that the Minister has promised to take action in this matter immediately upon <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hake&#39;s</inline> return to Australia.

            <para>. - I am glad that these items are being pushed forward, though I do not think there is the slightest necessity for including them in a list of works such as these. Again, I have to complain that the Government have placed the cart before the horse. I agree that these useful institutions ought to be inaugurated at the earliest possible moment consistent with the exercise of that supervision and care which are always sp necessary in the initiation of new ventures. There is no doubt for several reasons about the desirableness of the Government undertaking the establishment of these factories; Amongst these may- be mentioned our distance from the countries where these materials are manufactured - our isolation in every respect from the rest of the world, with all the possibilities of menace which surround us at the present moment. Those are sufficient reasons to give any Government pause with regard to defence matters. Further I hold very strongly that these are questions which cannot Deleft to the ordinary competition of private enterprise, but that the very fullest scrutiny and the best care should be brought to bear upon them, seeing that they affect the nation&#39;s supreme concern so vitally. I remember that a little while ago a great commotion was created in the House of Commons on account of some cordite which had been supplied to the War Office having been proved to be thoroughly defective. The moment that the War Office became aware of this fact, it struck off its list the contractors responsible for the supply of that cordite. It did so without the slightest hesitation ; it forbade them from tendering for any further supplies, and altogether it dealt in the most drastic and minatory way with all concerned in that transaction. Very properly so. I am glad to see that the Government are addressing themselves seriously to the problem of making Australia self-contained in the production of these war  materiels.  Having said that, may I suggest that they should proceed with this matter in the proper way ? Why, for instance, have no steps been taken to secure suitable sites where these works may be located? When the matter was mentioned last night by v/ay of interjection, the honorable member for Wide Bay immediately began to chide honorable members with their provincialism. I hold that to talk about the selection of sites in connexion with such important! undertakings does not evidence provincialism. I venture to say that the fixing of these sites may make a difference of from ^5,000 to ^10,000 in the construction of the works. </para>

              <para>- I do not know anything about votes. I decline to have anything to do with matters of a provincial character in considering the question of the nation&#39;s efficiency. If better sites for these undertakings can be found in any State than are available in New South Wales, by all means let us establish them there. Upon the other hand, if New South Wales is found to offer the best sites by reason of her resources, in the shape of coal and iron, the works should be located there. This is the one matter upon which we cannot afford to be provinical. Consequently, I do not propose even to indicate where the sites should be. </para>

            <para>- I am inclined to think that they should not. There is no connexion between them that I know of. I imagine that it would be all the better if the cordite factory were situated at a. little distance from the small arms factory, and for very obvious reasons. My point is that before now a selection of sites for the location of these works should have been made. That is the very beginning of the enterprise. But instead of that having been done, the Minister tells us that if this vote is authorized by Parliament, he hopes that a Committee of the House will be appointed to advise him- </para>

              <para>- There can be no doubt that Parliament will vote the necessary money for the purpose. If it is only an affirmation of principle which is required, that might have been obtained at any time by submitting a simple motion to the House, instead of asking it to vote the sum of  &#163;10,000.  Before this money is voted, I think that it ought to be allocated to specific purposes. Those purposes should include the selection of the sites, plans and specifications of the buildings, their output, and probable developments in the future. All these things ought to be known before a vote of this Committee is asked for. But, apparently, the Government desire to proceed in this matter as they have proceeded in other matters. </para>

              <para>- That is precisely the point. Of course, we, who have much smaller concerns to manage may put aside such trifles as responsible government. Moreover, it is very convenient for the Government to be able to throw responsibility upon the House,&#34; and to await its direction. But I venture to say that it is about time the Government &#34; plucked up&#34; its courage a little, and particularly in connexion with defence matters. Upon that question, of all others, there should be no hesitancy in shouldering the responsibility which properly attaches to them. I would very much prefer that the Minister should not now proceed with these items, but that he should proceed at once  with the projects which he has in hand, and as to which the House wishes him all the success that can possibly attend an individual occupying his position. These works ought to have been provided for long ago. There ought to be the greatest possible vigour exhibited in the prosecution of these undertakings to the point of success, so that we may be self-contained - well within ourselves and well within our resources - able to do all that is necessary to make our Army well found in every respect, so that it. may meet the foes which may descend upon us at any time. These are urgent matters, and because they are of supreme importance the Minister ought before to-day to have instituted inquiries as to the sites, their equipment, and every other detail connected with them.  I should like to know whether the honorable gentleman contemplates the appointment of a Committee to assist in the speedy selection of sites? It is of the utmost importance that we shall know where this money is to be expended, and where the works are to be located. The selection of sites may make a great difference in the cost of construction. Above all things, I hope that no provincialism will be allowed to creep into this matter. It should be far above all our party warfare - far above our ideas of what is due to any particular State. I decline to discuss it from any other stand-point, and I hope that the Minister will carry out his suggestion to the Committee so that the necessary sites may be speedily chosen, and these urgent works proceeded with, with the utmost despatch. </para>

I do not think that the Committee desires information as to where each gun will be placed. Rather too much publicity has been given in the past to our defence preparations. The officers of the Department have gone into this matter thoroughly, and, in my opinion, the money will be spent wisely. </para>

            <para>.- While the explanation of the Minister is satisfactory, so far as it goes, there is much information which ought to be supplied. We were told not long ago that the condition of our forts and equipment was of a most unsatisfactory character, and it would be interesting to know how far .&#163;50,000 will go towards remedying defects other than those connected with the lights. </para>

            <para>Quite certainly we have no vessels belonging to the&#39; Commonwealth which could be used, even to attempt to protect our coastal trade. The forts, for instance, about our principal cities are.&#39; in the first place, most of them of antiquated design, and very dangerous to the garrisons who would hold them under the fire of modern missiles. Then the guns in these forts are, many of them, old in type, and some quite obsolete. The <inline font-style="italic">Cerberus</inline> is merely a floating fort, without speed. The <inline font-style="italic">Protector</inline> and the other gunboats have all become very much out of date in respect of their armament.

              <para>- I think that we can. It is proposed to introduce a Bill to sanction the expenditure of &#163;250,000 on torpedo destroyers and torpedo boats for the defence of our harbors and rivers, although, in the opinion of naval and military authorities, much more effective defence could be provided by spending a smaller sum on fixed defences. I am not at liberty to mention names, but, in the opinion of gentlemen of considerable military and naval experience, well versed in these matters, our harbors and rivers could be more efficiently protected by fixed land batteries than by torpedo boats and destroyers, or even submarines. In a closed harbor torpedo boats, being able to dash suddenly from cover, against cruisers unable to manoeuvre freely in confined waters, have a much superior chance than on the high sea. Take it then that for the defence of such a harbor as that of Sydney two torpedo craft would be sufficient. At &#163;50,000 each these two craft would entail a capital expenditure of &#163;100,000 and a comparatively large annual outlay for crews and upkeep of ships. Yet six or eight 12-pounder Q.F. guns, mounted in proper positions, would be at least equally effective for defence of the harbor, and their capital cost inclusive of positions would be only from &#163;20,000 to &#163;25,000 and the annual upkeep would be insignificant compared with that of two destroyers. </para>

              <para>- No doubt that is so; but, in reply to the objection that we ^cannot afford to spend more than &#163;50,000 in one vear, I am pointing out that it is proposed to expend an additional &#163;250,600 in constructing a flotilla of torpedo destroyers, whereas the money, in the opinion of the best authorities, could be much more economically and effectively spent upon the erection of fixed batteries. At the same time, the question of employing submarines is worth consideration. I recognise the need for spending money liberally on our defences, but we must see that it is applied in the most effective way, and not wasted upon extravagant experiments, which, in the opinion of the best informed naval authorities, will not give satisfactory results. I put the matter before the Minister, hoping that when he isconsidering how. our forts can best be improved, he will see that a sufficient sum is expended to do what is necessary to make them as up-to-date and effective as possible. I hope that in dealing with this matter he will give attention to the points which I have put before him, and will weigh the relative merits of land batteries and torpedo and submarine defences, having regard both to effectiveness and eco:nomy in initial expense and maintenance. It is better to spend a small sum to obtain good results than to spend a large sum without achieving the end desired. </para>

              <para>- I shall remember all I have said ; and I declare fearlessly that I do not care how much we spend on defence so long as we secure efficiency. I do not desire to see any cheese-paring policy, in reference to defence, but we must have value for our money. If I see that we are not likely to get value, I shall oppose the expenditure as strongly as would the honorable member himself. The-  honorable member for Lang has contended that the forts are by no means up-to-date in regard to either construction or armament ; but I remind him that Rome was not built in a day, and that we cannot spend millions on forts in a week or a year. But there has been a policy of drift ; and as a result these forts are inefficient. We have it on the authority of the British Government that the submarine is to revolutionize the whole of the coastal and harbor defences of the old country. </para>

              <para>- If there were four submarines outside the heads of Port Phillip, would they not, at least, be sufficient to keep vessels, even of the <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> type, far enough from the coast to render them harmless to the forts or the city? Surely we ourfit to take the advice of the experts in the old country, who are practically devoting their lives to this particular phase of naval warfare. </para>

              <para>- That is an admission. The trouble is, however, that the officers of the British submarines are highly educated, technical experts, such as we have not within the Commonwealth. If the Commonwealth were to decide to adopt submarine defence, we should either have to train our officers on British vessels, or import British officers, and if we adopted the latter course, I can assure honorable members that those officers would not be bossed by any Captain Creswell. Personally, I have no doubt that the submarine will, in the near future, play a most important part in naval warfare. At present the radius of a submarine is 100 miles; but the French Government have in course of construction a vessel with a range of 1,000 miles. Half-a-dozen submarines of the latter type in and around, the harbors of Australia would, I think, be very effective protection. </para>

              <para>- I think the &#34;minor&#34; wouldvery soon reduce most of the &#34;major&#34; to &#34;minor.&#34; I am sure that if the honorable member were on board the <inline font-style="italic">Powerful</inline> in Sydney Harbor, and he knew that there was a submarine, of the type I have just mentioned, outside, he would not be &#34; game &#34; to proceed to sea, and tackle the submarine even though he were on a &#34;major&#34; vessel. Whatever we do in the way of providing land and naval forces, do not let us play with the matter ; even if our defence forces be small, let them be the best and most effective. We are now living practically in a fool&#39;s paradise, and we all know the fact. As I said on a previous occasion, if 50,000 or 60,000 Japanese were to land in the Northern Territory to-morrow, how could we eject them? There is a simple conundrum for honorable members to solve. I have visited the South Head fort in Sydney, and, though I was quite unknown to those in charge there, I had a look round ; and I say candidly, from what I know of fortifications - and I have seen the fortifications at Dover, which were the most up-to-date in my time - that the Port Jackson fortifications are very different from those of which I have had experience. In my judgment the forts at South Head are simply death traps, which would be perfectly untenable under the fire of howitzers. </para>

              <para>- But the fortifications are out of date. As the honorable member knows, in his own profession, the medical man of to-day is very far ahead of the medical man of a hundred years ago. I must say, however, that the forts at Sydnej were, no doubt, suitable for the purpose when they were built ; but the methods of warfare have greatly altered in recent years. I can give an instance of this from personal experience. In 1880, I went through a course of gunnery training at Shoeburyness, and was passed amongst the first six ; but when I went down to the Queenscliff forts, soon after I was ejected a member of this House, I found that every detail, even the fuses, was entirely foreign to me. That gives one an idea how progressive military science is ; and, as a matter of fact, naval warfare is even more progressive. In view of the possibilities of the submarine, I suggest that the Government should &#34; go slow &#34; in spending money in this direction. I hope that there is not going to be expenditure on frills, flummery, and  finery, or on racing torpedo boats and torpedo catchers for use in Port Phillip. I feel satisfied that the Minister of Defence is on the right track; and if honorable members desire information as to submarines, I can assure them that the honorable gentleman has in his possession some* of the most advanced and interesting books on the subject.. The work of rendering the forts efficient will have to be done gradually, but I have no doubt that it will be satisfactorily accomplished. </para>

            <para>.- We are glad to hear the honorable member for Maranoa, who is always interesting even if discursive. The Minister of Defence should be grateful to the honorable member, who has largely clouded the issue raised by this vote, his remarks being more relevant to another item, which applies to the building of an Australian Navy. The Minister of Defence, in reply to an interjection, said that, in asking the Committee to pass this vote of &#163;50,000, he was adopting a proposal of the Imperial Defence Committee. I do not think that the Minister has ever made any statement to the effect that the Government or the Department have accepted the report of the Imperial Defence Committee. It will be news to most honorable members that the adoption of these proposals will mean an absolute revolution in our big-gun practice. Hitherto we have had in Victoria 9.2 guns. </para>

In reply to a further interjection the Minister of Defence said that, with the change of guns, there would be no loss of power a,t the forts. Now, a 6-inch gun will carry only 9,050 yards. </para>

              <para>- That is the gun used by the Imperial authorities, and the comparison shows a decided lack pf power in the area controlled by the forts with 6-inch guns. The members of the Imperial Defence Committee are authorities ; but the worst of it is that we have so many authorities. When the honorable member for Maranoa indorsed the view expressed by the honorable member for Wilmot, that it would be wise to go slowly, I was reminded of the numberless authorities who have recommended changes in regard to the guns used in our fortifications. In the first instance, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Coode came to Australia and made certain recommendations, and he was followed by authorities from India. One expert recommended that we should build what&#39; is now known as the Pope&#39;s Eye fort. A sum of &#163;10,000 was expended in making an island of rubble at the point indicated, and &#39;it was then found that this work, which had been commenced on the recommendation of Imperial officers, specially introduced to advise us on these questions, would have to be abandoned. The authorities are now at a loss to know what to do with the fort. It might at any time . be turned on our defences at Port Phillip Heads, and I am sure that the military authorities would be glad to get rid of it. We have had expert after expert sent out to advise us, and their recommendations, after all, are merely passing phases of military opinion. Within ten years the whole of our guns at Queenscliff have been changed. With a desire to secure uniformity either 7.5 or 9.2 guns have been placed in position, and the guns formerly in use there have been removed either to Frankston, Swan Island, or South Channel. This alteration was made when  Colonel Bingham  was in Victoria some seven or eight years ago, and now, if we accept the recommendations of the Imperial Defence Committee, we shall placein position 6-inch guns- with a limited range of fire and a reduced control area. We are for the first time faced with a possible danger, which was not previously thought of. We have now in the Pacific the navy of a nation to which our aggressiveness in connexion with the policy of a White Australia has given some offence, and the officers of that navy, I am sorry to say, in many cases, know more about our forts than we do. It is now more than ever necessary that we should have full gun power at our forts. I can only repeat the advice tendered to the Minister, that he should go slowly, and I believe that he will proceed cautiously- I should like to know whether he intends to accept the recommendation made by the Imperial Defence Committee that we should abolish submarine mines ? </para>

            <para>Submarine mine fields at present exist at some of the Australian ports, but this form of defence is being discontinued at all ports in Imperial charge, as a result of the consideration by the Committee of Imperial defence of the general policy of submarine mining in relation to coast defence.....

              <para>- Channels which were previously protected by means of submarine mines are now, according to the Imperial Defence Committee, to be defended bv the introduction of an increased number of 6-inch guns in our forts. The Committee do not think that submarine mines are any longer necessary. The Minister has accepted the second recommendation that &#34;electric lights will be required at most forts to aid the gun defences,&#34; but he has not accepted what appears to be the necessary complement to the other recommendations - the proposal that submarine mines be abolished. </para>

The Committee is not in a position to properly discuss this proposal. The Minister has full .knowledge of the facts, and I think he ought to nave told us. in submitting this item, that the Government were adopting a definite scheme of defence, which differed from the system hitherto in force. He ought to have said, in other words, that they now contemplate  &#91;T3i&#93; 1  what means, practically, a revolution of our defence system. We ought not to be asked to agree to this vote without having before us definite proposals, which have been considered outside, and particularly by those who are experts in artillery work. We have had from the Minister only two or three casual observations as to a change of policy in regard to our garrison and fort defences. Does this proposal mean that we are to reduce the number of men in the permanent garrison a&#39;rtillery ? </para>

            <para>. - I <inline font-style="italic">do</inline> not think that the criticism indulged in by the honorable member for Corio is altogether justified since he wholly disregarded the first of these special votes. I believe that there- is on the part of the Government an intention- to alter our system of coastal defence, and I recognise that this item is an evidence of that intention. We are to have a very much larger measure of floating defences- than we have had, and it will be seen at once that, in such circumstances, the necessity of having in our forts guns of heavy metal and large carrying capacity, is not so great as it was. </para>

              <para>- Surely it is not to be said that because we do not agree with the report as a whole we are debarred from adopting any part of it which we think will be of value? I hold that the Government have done well in submitting these proposals. When the honorable member for Lang described the proposed vote as inadequate - and I agree that it is - I interjected that it would take some time to carry out the new. works. In the circumstances, it would be idle for the Government to ask Parliament to vote a greater sum than is required in respect of the expenditure for the current year. Nothing has yet been done in the direction, of carrying out these works, and I doubt whether we shall be able, before the close of the present financial year, to spend the whole of the &#163;50,000 which we are now asked to vote. When we take into account the alteration in policy which is involved in the defence scheme of the present Government, we must at once agree that they have acted wisely in providing in the Estimates now before us for only a limited expenditure. The honorable member for Maranoa described the South Head fortifications as death traps. </para>

              <para>- When I inquired, by way of interjection, whether they were not constructed under the advice and supervision of Imperial experts, the honorable member replied that they were, but urged that the officers in question should not be held blameable for the present situation, since, during the last quarter of a century, methods of warfare had materially changed. That reply, to my mind, does not meet the case.  1  agree that there have been within recent years marked changes with, respect to guns and ammunition, but, so far as fortifications are concerned, there have not been such sweeping revolutions as the honorable member&#39;s remarks would imply. In different parts of the world very many fortifications which may be described as death traps have been constructed, but surely it should be possible for those who have devoted their lives to the study of these questions to avoid such mistakes. Since we took over the defences of Australia, some six years ago, it has been found that the whole system, from top to bottom, is utterly inadequate and unsuited to our means and requirements. Surely the responsibility for that state of affairs does not rest with the Commonwealth. In making the changes which the honorable member for Corio described as amounting to a revolution of our defence sy&#39;stem, it would be well to proceed cautiously. We ought not, at the outset, to undertake too much. There may be a division of opinion in this House as to what is the right policy of defence to adopt, but I think that honorable members whose views on this question are diametrically opposed to those expressed over and over again by the present Government would be found promulgating a very similar policy if they occupied the Treasury benches. The suggestion that fixed defences are sufficient in time of need is one that will not bear a moment&#39;s consideration. Having regard to the enormous carrying power of modern ordnance, and to the&#39; fact that those whom we have most to fear will come from over sea, equipped, not so much for the acquisition of territory, as for the destruction of commerce and property, it must be recognised that we must have not only fixed land defences? but a system of defence which will at all events extend some distance from land so as to meet the enemy. In these circumstances, I hope that the Committee will approach the first of these items in the spirit in&#39; which I believe it has been submitted by the Government. I am sure that there is on the part of the Ministry only a desire to secure the most effective protection for Australia. The passing of this &#39; item will improve the present position, but, in the absence of item No. 1, it would be inadequate. Taking the system as a whole, it will be found that we have offered for our acceptance a policy &#39; of defence which should be sufficient for Australia for the next ten years. </para>

            <para>- I rise with a good&#39; deal of diffidence to discuss so highly technical a question as is that of defence, and particularly that branch of defence with which the item deals. I understood the Honorable member for Corio to object <inline font-style="italic">in toto</inline> to the report of the Imperial Defence Committee. Seeing that we have appealed to the highest court in the Empire so far as military matters are concerned, I think that we ought to pay some attention to its report. Personally, I congratulate the Minister upon his intention to give effect to at least a portion of that report. The question of the calibre, weight, and general efficiency of the guns mounted at our various forts is one upon which I do not feel competent to express an opinion. But I recollect that in regard to the advisability of mounting 6-inch mark VII. guns at Sydney Heads, those who are in authority there - it is almost an impertinence to&#39; say so - agree with the Imperial Defence Committee. When I raised the question of whether 9. 2 -inch guns ought not to be mounted there, in order that we might be in a position to meet an attack by similar guns, it was pointed out that the 6-inch mark VII. guns had almost as great a range as the 9.2-inch guns, whilst their rapidity of fire was so much greater that it added considerably to their efficacy. When we recollect that the guns of an attacking force would be required to cover a much longer range before they could reach Sydney, the fact that the 6-inch mark VII. guns have a less range than guns of a higher calibre is considerably discounted. I do not feel capable of forming a very w;eighty opinion upon this question, which is a highly technical one, but I am satisfied that the views expressed by the Imperial Defence Committee in their report, are. views which we shall do well to follow. There is nobody in the Defence Department at the present time who is capable of successfully criticising .the report of that body. For these reasons I intend to support the proposal of the Government, and I again congratulate the Minister upon having, so far, followed the opinions expressed by that Committee. There is just, one other matter to which I desire to direct attention. I refer to the very few hands who are employed in connexion with our fixed defences, and the artillery forces generally, in Sydney. We have, I understand, about sufficient men to work the guns in time of war - I am taking into consideration not only the permanent artillery, but the militia force - without making any allowance for losses caused by disablement from wounds, and  without providing reliefs and men to serve the ammunition. When this money is being expended, I think .that the Minister should bear in mind this very serious aspect of the case, with a view to seeing that this branch of&#39; the forces is considerably strengthened both in men and guns so far. as Sydney is concerned. </para>

              <para>- I wish to make my position perfectly clear. From the remarks of the honorable member for Laanecoorie, I gather that this proposal forms part of a scheme connected with the general defence policy of the Government, and that the principal items of expenditure upon coastal and harbor defence will be discussed at a later stage in connexion with proposed naval developments, presumably in the direction of providing for the construction of torpedo boats and destroyers. That is just what  1  fear, and thai; is why I think it would be well for us to have a general statement by the Minister as to the defence policy of the Government before we authorize this expenditure. </para>

We do not know whether, in voting this- money, we shall be assisting to develop a policy which will meet with the approval, or the disapproval, of Parliament. To that ex: tent, we are placed at a very great dis-&#39; advantage. If, instead of developing bar land batteries for the protection of our harbors and rivers, the Government propose, at a later stage, to expend &#163;250,000 in the construction of torpedo craft and torpedo boat destroyers, I am afraid that they will be asking us to commit ourselves to a policy which will prove a wasteful one in the end, besides being a very ineffective one. If we are going to expend money in the direction of naval equipment for the protection of our harbors and rivers,, and if we are asked to choose as between torpedo boat destroyers and submarines,- I shall unhesitatingly support the latter as being a more effective and reliable type of vessel. If the Government intend to rely upon Captain Creswell&#39;s scheme for their general system of harbor and river defence, I would point out that that scheme has been denounced by the Imperial Defence Committee in their report as one which is - </para>

              <para>- I remember that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wyndham</inline> stated some time ago that a nation might dispense with submarine mines when it had something else to take their place. Consequently, they may be dispensed with in a well-protected port, whereas it would be unwise to do away with them in a badly protected port in Australia. That is a common-sense view of the matter, and, after all, these questions must be governed by common sense. With regard- to. the 6-inch mark VII. gun, it is admittedly a good weapon. I have already instructed the officers of the Department that the worst guns are to b.e discarded first. They will not dream of discarding a 9. 2 -inch gun with a view to substituting for it a 6-inch mark VII. weapon. </para>

              <para>- The fortifications of Townsville and Albany do not enter into consideration under this vote. No expenditure upon guns  for mounting &#39; at those ports is proposed at present. &#34; My own view is that for the time being they should be allowed to remain as they are. We ( should do the more important and pressing work first, but it is probable that, as those ports are situated close to a great passing traffic, and with a long distance intervening between them and the. next protected ports, Australia will find &#39; it necessary to maintain forts at these places for all time. </para>

I desire, in the first place, to briefly outline the circumstances under which the anomaly to which I have referred became apparent.

The New South Wales Commissioner of Taxes brought an action against the Collector of Customs in Sydney; and the District Court Judge followed the decision of the Privy Council as against thedecision of the High Court. The case then came on appeal before the High Court, which held that this was one of the particular questions, which, under section 74 of the Constitution, are intrusted to the HighCourt of the Commonwealth for decision. The High Court held that they were bound to give an independent interpretation on the question submitted to them ; and they re-affirmed their previous&#39; decision in <inline font-style="italic">Deakin</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Webb.</inline> The High Court affirmed their rule of interpretation;, and I think that any one who carefully studies the principles of the Constitution,, will find that the rule of interpretation laid down by the High Court is clear and intelligible, and, in the words of Chief Justice Marshall, a rule which is both safe for the Union and safe for the States. It was a decision which recognised that, in interpreting the Constitution the grant of powers respectively to the Commonwealthand the State, necessarily implied, as a consequence, the complete sovereignty of each, within its own respective jurisdiction. That rule of interpretation was adopted in the United States case of <inline font-style="italic">McCulloch</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Maryland,</inline> 4 Wheat., 316. The rule was applied later on- in the case of <inline font-style="italic">Dobbins</inline> ;v. <inline font-style="italic">Commissioners of Erie County,</inline> 16 Peters, 435, in which it was held, as in our ownCourt, that Federal officers were not liable to State taxation. In the case of <inline font-style="italic">The Collector</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Day,</inline> 11 Wallace, 113, and in a! still later case it has been held that Congress had no power, by its legislation, tr&#62; interfere with the sovereignty of a State.  </para>

              <para>- Exactly ; he agreed with the rule of interpretation, but not with its application in this particular case. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins held a different view altogether. I was pointing out that the High Court recognised the necessity for such a rule of interpretation to safeguard the interests of the States. The point arose in the case of the <inline font-style="italic">Federated AmalgamatedGovernment Railway and Tramway Service Association</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">The New South Wales Railway Traffic Employes Association,</inline> 4 C.L.R., 488. There was a dispute between two unions in respect to registration, and the point was referred to the High Court as to whether the Commonwealth Parliament, under its power to legislate with reference to conciliation and arbitration- had power to include in that legislation railway servants employed by the States authorities. The Court held that the Commonwealth had no such power - that any such legislation would be an interference with the powers of the States. The Court applied the converse of the rule in <inline font-style="italic">D&#39;Emden</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Pedder,</inline> and held that what applied to the Commonwealth and its jurisdiction applied also to the State in its jurisdiction. The State Government in this particular instance called to. their aid the rule of interpretation, which in Baxter&#39;s case they were disputing. </para>

              <para>- Exactly ; just as&#34;, in England the Courts pay attention to the decisions of the United States Courts in the matter of insurance. In the United States, the law of insurance has been more fully developed than in any other country, and the English Courts, while not necessarily following American decisions, pay that respect which is due to a great tribunal that has had years of experience, in the interpretation of a particular branch of law, and, if the reasoning commends itself, the decisions are adopted. </para>

              <para>- And when, for instance, the United States embodied in its law the Statute of Limitations or the Statute of Frauds, it so held that of necessity all rules of interpretation which have grown up around the particular Statute should also be adopted. That is the principle which the High Court, has ap-  plied in the interpretation of the Commonwealth Constitution. The position now is that there are two co-ordinate Courts capable of giving different decisions, and each is an ultimate and final Court. In a matter in which we require above all things certainty, we have uncertainty. </para>

              <para>- The Privy Council in many respects is superior, but, as has been pointed out by an accepted authority, under the Commonwealth Constitution there has been created, for the first time in the history of an Empire, a Court with the peculiar power to give decisions of its own which are not subject to appeal to the Privy Council unless the High Court sees fit to allow an appeal. That being so, it is highly desirable that the anomaly should be removed - that a suitor should not be able to bring an action in one Court and get one decision, go to a second Court in another action and get another decision. The question is how can this anomaly&#39; be removed. Fortunately, the Constitution has been so enacted that within its terms we have power to remove the anomaly, by excluding from the State Supreme Courts, from the judgments of which an appeal lies to the Privy Council, matters of Federal jurisdiction. It was pointed out bv some of the Justices of the High Court that Ave have this power. I shall read one passage from the judgment of the majority read by Chief Justice Griffith, as it appears on page 1114 of the report in volume. 4 of the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Law Reports -</inline></para>

            <para>It is clear that by the exercise of the power conferred by section 77 the Parliament of the Commonwealth could have withdrawn the cognizance of matters arising under the Constitution, or involving its interpretation, altogether from the Courts of the State, and so have drawn them&#39; within the sole cognizance of Federal1 Courts, with a consequential appeal to the High Court, and prohibition of appeal to the Queen in Council, except in the specified cases. </para>

            <para>There are two ways of escape, quite easy and both open. One is the exercise by the Federal Parliament of its powers under section 77 (a) of the Constitution, which can be done in variousways. One way would be by making the appellate jurisdiction of this Court exclusive of the appellate jurisdiction of the State Supreme Courts in some or all of the matters which together are called Federal jurisdiction. They may exercise that power in full or limit it to any class of those matters. </para>

          <para class="block">These are the only classes of cases which, under this measure, we propose to exclude from the State Supreme Courts. I ask honorable members to remember that we are really under a Federal system of Government, and that there are three things which are essential under any Federal system. In the first place, we must have &#34; a written supreme Constitution in order to prevent disputes between the jurisdictions- of the Federal and State authorities.&#34; In the second place, there must be &#34; a distribution of powers between the Central or Federal Government arid the Governments of the several States which comprise the union, and probably, also, among the various parts of the Federal Government.&#34; Thirdly, there must be *&#39; a Supreme Court charged with the duty of interpreting the Constitution, and enforcing obedience to it by the organs both of the Federal and State Governments, and absolutely free from the influence of both.&#34; Since we are living under a Federal Constitution, by which we have powers distributed among the Commonwealth and the States, and shall have conflicts arising as to whether the Commonwealth or the States have. a particular power, it becomes absolutely essential that we should have one Court, which shall be the interpreter of the Constitution. It is absolutely necessary that there should be only one Court, because questions arising as to the respective powers of the Commonwealth and the States are not trivial or unimportant. They are fundamental questions, striking at the very foundation of our constitutional government. The position is the same in the United States of America. </para>

              <para>- I am afraid that that remark is irrelevant. Living, as we are, under a Federal Constitution, by which these powers are distributed, it is absolutely essential that there should be a Court to interpret them. The question! is what Court shall be the interpreter? Shall it be an Australian Court, or the Privy Council across the sea? At the Convention the ideal held  by the delegates was that there should be in Australia an Australian Court for the interpretation of Australian questions. It was realized that questions as to the distribution of powers of government between two different sovereign bodies created by the people were of purely Australian interest, affecting no other part of the Empire. It was realized also that Australian Judges who were accustomed to our own political system, who were familiar with the history of Australian conditions, who understood the aims and aspirations and ideals of Australian people, and who had lived through the stress and strain of our own political life, would best interpret such questions. That was the idea we believed we had carried out. It was recognised and realized that the High Court was to fulfil, under the Australian Constitution, the same functions which the Supreme Court of the United States fulfilled under the Constitution of that country, and would become, in a sense, the guardian and the interpreter of the Australian Constitution. Dicey, in the 6th edition of his .work on <inline font-style="italic">The Law of the Constitution,</inline> page 431, refers to the position of the Australian High Court as the interpreter and protector of the Constitution - </para>

            <para>Lastly the Law Courts, and especially the Federal Supreme Court are, as in the United States, the guardians of the Constitution for the Courts are called upon in any case which comes before them for decision to pass judgment, should the point be raised, upon the constitutionality, or, in other words, upon the validity, under the Constitution, of any Act passed either by the Parliament of the Commonwealth or by the Parliament of, <inline font-style="italic">e.g.,</inline> Victoria. That this duty is laid upon the Courts is not indeed expressly stated in the Constitution of the Commonwealth  any  more than in the Constitution of the United States, but no English lawyer can doubt that the Courts,, and ultimately the Federal Supreme Court, are intended to be the interpreters, and, in this sense, the protectors of the Constitution. </para>

              <para>- It is obvious, when we remember that Australia, in framing a Federal Constitution, followed, not the Canadian system, under which there is an attempt to make an exclusive distribution of powers between the Dominion Government and the Provinces, leaving the rersiduary power to the central Government, but the United States system, by which enumerated powers are delegated to the central authority, and the residuary powers are left to the States. We followed the American Constitution in establishing a High Court of Justice, and I think that every one connected with the framing df the Australian Constitution believed that the High Court was to be a truly Australian Court, destined to be the interpreter of our Constitution. </para>

Qf course it will be argued that this Constitution will have been made by the Parliament of the United Kingdom. That will be true in one sense, but not true in effect, because the provisions of thisConstitution, the principles which it &#34;embodies, and the details of enactment by which those principles are enforced, will all have been the work of Australians.

            <para>This agreement follows exactly the principles I have laid down. That is to say, it leaves Australia absolutely free to take its own course where Australian interests are solely and exclusively concerned, and it makes provision in all other cases, in which other than Australian interests are concerned, that the right of appeal shall be fully maintained. The delegates pointed out to us that their desire, and- what they believed to be the desire of the people of Australia, was that where difference arose as to the interpretation of the Constitution between two States or between any one State and the Federal Parliament, and where, therefore, Australian interests were exclusively concerned, they should have the right of dealing with such questions finally in Australia, and I at once admitted, on behalf of  Her  Majesty&#39;s Government, that that was entirely in accordance with the principle which we had constantly laid down - that if it could be shown- that in questions of that sort Australian interests were exclusively concerned, we claimed no right whatever to interfere with their decision. Accordingly, we have agreed to exclude that particular case from the clause in which an appeal lies to the Privy Council. But we asked that, inasmuch as experience had shown, in the case of Canada,, that an appeal in such cases was valued by both parties, and that experience might show in Australia that it will&#39; be in the future &#34;a desirable thing to have a Court free from all prepossession, to which both parties could appeal, words should be inserted giving this right of appeal in every case in which both parties consent. The effect &#39; of this understanding will be that clause 74 will be exactly reversed ; that whereas, in the original clause, appeal was to cease in all cases except where the public interests of some portion of  Her  Majesty&#39;s Dominions outside Australia were concerned, in the clause as we now propose to insert it an appeal will lie in every case, except in the cases where Australian, interests alone are concerned. </para>

            <para>Supposing a litigant takes his case first to the Privy Council, and succeeds, his opponent may, in another case, raising the same point, take him to the High Court to get round the difficulty, which he can do, because the proposal of the right honorable gentleman gives him a right of appeal. But that is a totally different appeal to the one in Canada, because there the Supreme Court is not a Court of final jurisdiction. As the clause makes the High Court of Australia a Court of final jurisdiction, there may well be conflicting decisions between the High Court and the Privy Council. I do not think that is an academic matter. </para>

            <para>Under the amendment the Committee is now discussing, the High Court of the Commonwealth of Australia will not be a Court of co-ordinate jurisdiction with the Privy Council, and it will be bound to follow the decision of the Privy Council. I cannot feel by any means so clear as my right honorable and learned friend on that point, because we are here makin&#34; a settled provision for a special case. From the general r\ght of appeal to the Privy Council to be granted, we are excepting by statute one particular class of cases, questions involving the construction of the Constitution of the Commonwealth. Surely it will not only be within the power of, but also the duty and the right of the High Court, to give full effect to that provision of the Australian Constitution, and to say, &#34; We are in this particular matter made a final&#34; Court of Appeal. In all other matters we&#39; are undoubtedly a subordinate Court, unless in a particular matter we are made a Court of coordinate jurisdiction.&#34; They would say, &#34; The only appeal is to lie from us where we are satisfied there is some special reason ; we are bound to carry out the intention of the people of Australia and of the Imperial Parliament in not going beyond the express provision ; they have given no appeal unless special reasons, in our opinion, exist.&#34; I think, therefore, that it will be open to the High Court in future to hold that in this matter they arc a Court not of subordinate jurisdiction, but of co-ordinate jurisdiction. I cannot assent to the argument that, because they are subject to appeal in other cases, they are subject to appeal in this case also. </para>

            <para>Clause 74 as it stands is a perfect solecism in jurisprudence, and for this reason that it creates two final co-ordinate Courts of Appeal neither of which is bound by the decision of the other. . . The Judicial Committee, of course, is not bound by the decision of the High Court, nor, as I understand, is the High Court bound to follow the decisions of the Judicial Committee in matters of this kind.

            <para>I fail to see anything in this Bill asserting directly or indirectly that where the decision of the Privy Council conflicts with the decision of the High Court the decision of the Privy Council is to prevail. I see nothing to that effect expressed certainly, and nothing I think to be implied. When I remind your Lordships that the clause expressly says that the. High Court shall be the final judge in the matter unless it chooses to give leave, surely that does lay a solid and reasonable foundation for the contention that it is thereby, as regards matters so dealt with in the clause, created the final Court, and therefore co-ordinate with the other final Court - namely, the Privy Council. </para>

          <para class="block">What was predicted has arisen, and as Ft is now seen that we have two final coordinate Courts of Appeal, the question to decide is, are we going to allow the High Court to exercise the powers undoubtedly conferred on it by the Constitution, and thus enable the ideals and aspirations of the people of Australia to be fulfilled, or are we going to permit a conflict of jurisdiction to continue, which will result in indescribable confusion, and the shattering of the hopes of the Australian people? I think that Parliament should endeavour to give effect to what was undoubtedly the intention of the Convention and the wish of Australia. The Bill does not destroy the general right of appeal to the Privy Council ; that is not disturbed in the slightest degree. But it is provided that matters of purely Australian concern, and exclusively of Australian interest, insomuch as they affect the distribution of powers, shall be left to the Australian Court. Those who read the decisions of the High Court and of the Privy Council must come to the conclusion that &#39;it would be unsatisfactory to leave questions affecting the distribution of power to any other than an Australian court. It is therefore provided in the Bill that- in matters (other than trials of indictable offences) involving any question, however arising, as to the limits <inline font-style="italic">inter se</inline> of the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth and those of any State or States, or as to the limits <inline font-style="italic">inter se</inline> of the constitutional powers of any two or more States, the jurisdiction of the High Court shall be exclusive of the jurisdiction of the Supreme Courts of the States. </para>

              <para>- Yes ; in this Chamber; though their effect has been unfortunate in the interests of litigants. Their omission is provided for to enable any case in which a question arises under the Constitution, or involving its interpretation, to be taken from any State Court straight to the High Court. &#39; This will .be a simple, expeditious way of getting to the final Court without preliminary hearings and appeals, with all their attendant expense. In this respect, we propose to make the law conform with the provisions of the original Judiciary Bill as introduced into this House, whereby power was conferred on the High Court to order the removal of all cases of this kind from the State Courts. </para>

              <para>- That would raise the question whether we have power to exclude the Supreme Courts of the States from jurisdiction in this matter, and I think.it would be held that under the Constitution we clearly hive that power. Having the power to exclude, we must have the power to remove, and no appeal could lie against its proper exercise. The Bill has not been introduced out of any feeling of disrespect for the Privy Council, a tribunal which has undoubtedly rendered splendid service to the Empire. Its object .is to terminate the conflict of opinion which now exists, in a manner harmonizing with the ideals of the Australian people. </para>

              <para>- That is what I am trying to do, and I believe I am keeping within the rules of the House. I should not have submitted this motion if the circumstances had not been peculiar, or if I had thought for a moment that a majority of honorable members were against the Government on the particular question. It is because I do not believe that the majority of honorable members, who are in the city and in the vicinity of the House, are against the Government that I submit the motion, so that there may be another opportunity of taking a vote on practically the same question. Under ordinary circumstances, in view of the vote given.I should at once have moved the adjournment of the House; but, under the peculiar circumstances, I feel justified in taking mv present course. , If honorable members resort to a trick they must expect to have a rough time. I do not wish to display any heat in this matter. I happened to be out of the Chamber at the time, but I understand that the  deputy  leader of the Opposition passed a paper across the table  10  the Attorney-General while the latter was speaking, and asked him a question. </para>

              <para>- When the House adjourned for dinner I was explaining my reasons for submitting this motion. It will be remembered that we decided, in the first session of the present Parliament, that the sittings of the House should be suspended for an hour and a quarter instead of an hour for dinner, in order to suit the convenience of honorable members who wished to go home, and might not otherwise be able to be in their places if a division were taken immediately before or after the adjournment. It seems to me that the alteration has not had the effect that we anticipated, and that we shall have to consider whether it is not desirable to revert to the old practice of adjourning from 6.30 until 7.30, or to adjourn from 6 to 7 p.m. In any event, the incident which happened shortly before the sitting was suspended, and which was intended to delay business, will have the effect of delaying the consideration of the Tariff. </para>

              <para>- Then I shall withdraw the remark. I think that I am justified in drawing the deduction I have mentioned, especially when it is remembered that a certain communication passed between the&#39; Attorney-General, who was moving the second reading of the Bill, and the  deputy  leader of the Opposition. If the honorable member had any object in passing that note to the Attorney-General, surely it was &#39; to lead him to believe that there&#39; was no intention on the part of the Opposition to depart from what has been the usual course of refraining from taking a division when the dinner hour is at hand. </para>

              <para>- It has been the understanding for the last two or three years. I have submitted this motion because it is the only course open to me in my desire to expedite the business that the Government are determined to deal with in order that the consideration of the Tariff may be resumed at the earliest possible moment. I wish the House to deal with this measure, since it is of the greatest importance from the stand-point of the Commonwealth. Honorable members were aware that the Government were going to&#34; proceed with it to-day, but, unfortunately, we did not know what move the Opposition had in contemplation. If the Opposition think that the tactics to which they have resorted are right, then we shall simply have to sit still and insist upon the business being conducted in the way that the Government desire. </para>

This is anurgent measure, and when it, and one or two small Bills which I have previously mentioned have been disposed of, I shall not, so far as I. am personally concerned, allow any other business, unless it be something which suddenly crops up and needs immediate settlement, to interfere with our consideration of the Tariff. </para>

Before proceeding to offer reasons for submitting this amendment, I should like to make an explanation regarding a trifling incident which took place before the sitting was suspended, and for which every reason but the right one has been given. It is true that whilst the- AttorneyGeneral was speaking, about 6 p.m., I passed a note to him. </para>

              <para>- Very well. Why did I pass that. note across the table? It is well known that the- honorable member for Kooyong is very unwell. He desired to go home, but was willing to remain if the honorable member was likely to conclude within a short time. It was for that reason that I passed the note t&#39;o the Attorney-General. My desire was to send the honorable member for Kooyong home, as soon as he had secured a pair,  if the Minister would not shortly conclude. The moment the AttorneyGeneral told me that he would not conclude until the dinner-hour, a pair was arranged with the honorable member for Melbourne, and the honorable member for Kooyong left. So much for the mysterious, missive. I am asked why I should have desired any information concerning the time likely to be occupied by the AttorneyGeneral. </para>

              <para>- I do not know that I could have gone about this matter in any better way with a view to saving the time of the country. May I offer my congratulations to the Government for an opportunity, such as seldom occurs, of furnishing an explanation after the event. Thanks to the brilliant strategy of the Government I am permitted to make such an explanation. But I now wish to give my reasons for taking the course which I &#39; pursued this afternoon. Whilst the AttorneyGeneral was moving the second reading of the Judiciary Bill I asked him upon three occasions to explain the supreme urgency of that measure. He declined to answer my question beyond saying that it was an irrelevant interjection. During the whole of his long speech he did not utter a single sentence which was calculated . to show that any urgency whatever attaches to that Bill. The only suggestion of urgency is the mysterious one which is now made by the Acting Prime Minister as to certain pending litigation. If that be the only reason for its urgency it is the reason of all others why the measure should not be passed at present. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member has a perfect right to take possession of the House it seems to me. I wish to give the reasons which induced me to take the course which I have adopted upon the present occasion. I observe tonight that the Acting Prime Minister intends to proceed not only with the Judiciary Bill, but with one or two other &#34; minor &#34; measures before he invites us to resume the consideration of the Tariff. It is clear, therefore, that he has in view the passing of a programme of general legislation before proceeding with the Tariff discussion. I wish to enter my strong protest against the interpolation of this legislation while the Tariff remains unsettled.It seems to me that the Tariff is of the very first .importance. It is first in its farreaching and profound effect upon the trading community of Australia, and it is easily entitled to first consideration when, compared with any measures that may be brought before this Chamber.. Honorable members know that from day to day we are being deluged with the plaintive appeals of men who are being injured by the present duties. </para>

              <para>- Let us get to them- at once, and let us deal in their proper order with these measures which have no particular urgency. Will it be contended for a moment that the question of whether or not we shall take away from the Supreme Courts of the States powers which have already been conferred upon them either by &#39;the Constitution or by prior legislation, transcends in importance the Tariff proposals of the Government? Is the question of whether our Commonwealth officers shall pay income tax in the various States more urgent than consideration of the Tariff? Then there is the Parliamentary Witnesses Bill. I imagine that the Commonwealth will not go to pieces if that measure is never passed. </para>

              <para>- I have yet to learn that it is required for any purpose. The only thing contemplated by that Bill is that a- witness who does not say what he ought to say in giving evidence before a Committee of this Parliament, may be sent to gaol for two years. Certainly the measure is not of sufficient importance to warrant it being proceeded with before the Tariff. I have no desire to labour this question. I do not know that I can do better than recite some of the reasons why the consideration of the Tariff should be immediately resumed, which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of Monday last. I shall be glad if honorable members, will listen to this simple recital of reasons why the Tariff should take precedence- over all other legislation. </para>

            <para>People are very naturally becoming impatient about the dawdling over the Tariff. No pro,gress has been made in it for weeks, and yet of all things -before Parliament it is just the very measure about which most expedition was necessary. All business men are agreed that in theinterval between the submission and enactment, of a Customs Tariff commerce is embarrassed.. Sellers cannot fix prices ; buyers do not knowhow to make contracts; building operations are often suspended pending the settlement of certain doubtful duties ; tenderers have to cover their risks by the charging of maximum prices: importers hold their orders in abeyance, and the holders of stocks charge extreme rates upon merchandise which has never paid duty. All&#39; these things are within the common knowledge of everybody as the concomitants of Tariffchanges. And each one of them forms a separate and distinct reason why there should not be one day&#39;s unnecessary delay between the submission of a Tariff schedule and its inscription on the statute book. </para>

            <para>A feeling akin to  exasperation  is being manifested in commerical circles over the protracted  delay  of Parliament in dealing with the Tariff schedule. Since the promulgation of the new duties on  9th  August there has been an amount of unrest that will not be allayeduntil the various items have been passed bv Parliament. Rightly or wrongly, there is a. belief that alterations will take place - such trades as those of leather making, timber cut-&#39; ting and dressing, boot making and metal machine making are particularly unsettled - and in: the meantime wholesale and retail merchants, are completing only those purchases that are absolutely necessary. As for the public at. large, it is &#39;still very much in the dark. The prevailing uncertainty means, in some instances,, a virtual paralysis of business. And every day of inaction makes matters worse. It was hoped that &#34;the Tariff in Committee&#34; would be the first item on the bill of fare for the meetingof the House of Representatives this afternoon, and there was, to put it mildly, a feeling the reverse of pleasurable among the mercantile community at the announcement made yesterday that the Public Works Bill, the Judiciary Bill&#34; and the Income Tax Bill were all to be discussed before the Tariff was considered. </para>

              <para>- There is no need to apologize to the members&#39; of the Opposition. They know whether what&#39; occurred, was or was not pre-arranged. If it was - not, I withdraw what I have said.. Why&#39; do honorable members wish to postpone the consideration of the Judiciary Bill ? The  deputy  leader of the Opposition took action very suddenly in regard to the matter. As a rule, when the leader of the Opposition desires that a debate shall not be proceeded with immediately the mover of a motion for the second reading of a Bill has concluded his speech, he asks if there will be any objection to the moving of the adjournment. </para>

But, for reasons best known to the Opposition, action was taken to prevent us from proceeding with it. The measure is a most important one, and should he proceeded with immediately. </para>

              <para>- The Tariff is a must important measure, and I hope that honorable members, when they come to if, will despatch it quickly, dealing with it in a business-like method&#39;, instead of making speeches of live or six hours&#39;&#39; duration, and quoting long extracts from books, newspapers, and periodicals. By insinuation-, the members on the Ministerial side of the House have been charged with not being eager to proceed, with the Tarin*. But where have the speeches which we have heard recently come from? </para>

Is it because they are opposed to the national interests underlying this measure that honorable members attack it in this way ? The Australian people believed that in accepting the Constitution they were creating an Australian tribunal for its interpretation. It is because it has been found that their intention has not been carried out, and that we have power to give effect to it, that we are pressing forward the Judiciary Bill at the present time. </para>

              <para>- It is an exceedingly urgent matter that the Bill should be passed. Honorable members opposite prate about the necessity of passing the Tariff, but- they are raising all sorts of objections to the consideration of this measure, which must be dealt with before the Tariff can be proceeded with. They are trying to create all kinds of difficulties to postpone the consideration of the Tariff.. If they think that the Judiciary Bill is not an important measure, why do they not help us to get rid of it, and to proceed with the Tariff? The deputy leader of the Opposition supported his action by quotations from the <inline font-style="italic">Age.</inline> T am glad that he is beginning to read the articles which are published in that newspaper. If he continues to do so, we may hope for his fiscal conversion. We know that several Victorian free-traders were converted to protection by articles published in the <inline font-style="italic">Age.</inline> We believe that if the honorable member  for Parramatta will continue to read the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> we shall see also his conversion. If the honorable member will only interpret in the spirit in which it was written the article from which he has quoted, he will see that it is really an attack on himself and his colleagues for delaying the Tariff. </para>

              <para>- I should rather say* it has rebounded on the Opposition. Surely the measure dealing with the income tax question is an important one, seeing that the delay in its passage has been a cause of complaint in each of the States. The Prime Minister, at the Premiers&#39; Conference, &#39; promised that this measure would be introduced at the earliest possible date ; and, in fulfilment of that promise, it has received the sanction of the Senate, and now awaits the decision of honorable members of this House. </para>

            <para>.- I see no necessity for long speeches or for the display of any heat in regard to this matter. There is a difference of opinion between honorable members on this side and the Government and their supporters, :is to which measures are the most important. We on this side of the House regard the Tariff as the most urgent matter, seeing that it is the main business in the Government programme, and has times out of number been described as the great work of the session. It- is now nearly three months since we met, but we have not yet really reached the consideration of the Tariff, although, from one end of Australia to the other, the people are adversely criticising the character of the fiscal proposals. </para>

              <para>- I am not prepared to subscribe to that statement. The real question before us; as I have said, is, which is the more urgent business - the Tariff or the Judiciary Bill, and the other measures which have been mentioned. We on this side, who regard the Tariff as the more urgent, feel quite justified in taking the first opportunity to express that opinion to the country at large. I do not think the Government have any right to complain because the  deputy  leader of the Opposition took the means he thought best to indicate that, in the opinion of honorable members on this side, the Government are not acting in the best interests of the country in postponing the consideration of the Tariff in order to deal with the Judiciary and other Bills. The Judiciary and the other Bills, important though they may be, are not, in our opinion, nearly so pressing as the Tariff, which we &#39;urge should be disposed of as soon as possible. As for the statements that caucuses have taken place and tricks resorted to, all I can say is that I know nothing of them. I know the views of honorable members who sit in the Opposition corner, and I hope that the day is far distant when we shall resort to any tricks. If we cannot act straightforwardly and honorably, I hope we shall not act at all. Of course, it is not necessary that we should go about telling every one what we propose to do at all times ; but any underhand business, or any subterfuge or trickery will not be tolerated by any of us. How the Government can make themselves believe that the course they are taking is in the best interests of the country, I cannot understand. It would almost appear that the Government are indifferent as to the Tariff - that they are satisfied now that they are collecting the higher duties, and do not seem eager to give the House an opportunity to deal with the matter. If the Government are in earnest, how can they stand in their places and contend that the Judiciary Bill and the other measures are so urgent that the Tariff, which vitally affects the people throughout the length and breadth of Australia, must be postponed to a more convenient season until they are dealt with? </para>

              <para>-But after five years of loyal support, during which I sat up all night many a time, and, at his instigation, applied the gag to the Government&#39;s opponents whenever necessary, all the thanks I get is an accusation of continued inconsistency. Perhaps I deserve some such treatment - I should have discerned earlier that the honorable member did not deserve support. </para>

              <para>- The right honorable member for Swan is not following my example. When I discontinued supporting the Government of which the honorable member for Parramatta was a member, I went into direct opposition, and stated, in so many words, what I intended to do. On the other hand, the right honorable member for Swan, as I understood him some time ago, said he would continue to be a supporter of the Government. Perhaps the right honorable member meant th&#39;at he would be a discriminating supporter of the Government. </para>

              <para>- That is not a fact. The honorable member for Parramatta has spoken about the Government&#39;s strategy on this occasion ; but it appears to me that any strategy there may be is on the part of the Opposition. The care with which honorable members opposite kept the knowledge from other members of the House that they were going to take action this evening, and the evident success with which they retained members who are usually conspicuous by their absence, certainly points to strategy, successful as far as it goes. But, to my way of thinking, such strategy is scarcely worth the effort. </para>

            <para>-l&#39; shall do so. I desire to show that the vote arrived at before the dinner hour was distinctly a snap vote; and tactics of the sort do not reflect credit on those who resort to them, even if thev are temporarily successful. Even when I was in opposition I never lent myself to any attempt to procure a snap vote. I have never believed in such tactics, and do not think they are proper. I do not doubt that honorable members are within their rights in resorting to such a procedure,- hut, to my mind, although at the time it mav appear to be eminently successful, it is of no real advantage to an Opposition. </para>

              <para>- As the honorable member&#39;s remarks in this &#34;rarer atmosphere&#34; usually are. If the Opposition were really anxious to get the Tariff out of the way, it seems to me that they would assist in clearing the decks of necessary legislation of this kind, in order that we might reach it. But they have for days in this Chamber, exhibited an anxiety merely to delay business - an anxiety to fill up the time at any cost. </para>

              <para>- Probably, .as my opinion has been indorsed by the honorable member, thev will accept it. I admit the urgency of the Tariff, but so far as Australia is concerned, the settlement of the constitutional question dealt with in the Judiciary Bill is of greater urgency. The delay in dealing with the Tariff creates, at the worst, but a temporary dislocation, but the future liberties of Australia may depend on our having our own tribunal to decide questions- arising under the Constitution. There is no comparison, so far as the future of this continent is concerned, between the urgency of an ephemeral mea-; sure like the Tariff and a Bill affecting the Constitution and its interpretation. If the honorable member for Parkes were on this side of the House he would raise his ponderous bulk and equally ponderous voice, and tell us how highly important it was that these great constitutional questions should be settled before anything else. But as he happens to be in opposition the position is different. </para>

              <para>- Having regard to the interjection made by the honorable member for Parramatta. one would think that the Opposition were never guilty of rudeness. I was under the impression that a good deal of rudeness had emanated from that side of the House, and some from the honorable member, and that therefore I might be excused for imitating them to some extent. The honorable member for Parramatta concluded his remarks a few moments ago by quoting with great gusto and approval from leading articles published in the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> in which the House was urged not to dawdle over the Tariff. The honorable member did not tell us that the leading article which he quoted, admirable as it was, was directed mainly at the Opposition for their delaying tactics. </para>

              <para>- I  was hopeful, sir, that its veracity would have atoned for its being slightly out of order. It does not seem to me that it should take long to deal with this Bill, if we approach its consideration with an honest desire to make it as workable as possible. It was before the Senate for some time; and received there very careful consideration, particularly from the legal members. There is, after all, not a wealth of detail in it. It is mainly an assertion of a principle regarding the interpretation of our Consti- . tution.  I  should be sorry to hear that any proportion of honorable members of this House was out of sympathy - with the object at which this measure aims, and I do not think much time should be consumed in its discussion. There can be no doubt as to the desirableness of having only one Court to interpret the Consitutionunder which we have our political being, and there should be no doubt as to the necessity of having the matter determined af the earliest possible moment. </para>

              <para>- I would have it apply even to such cases. It is most unfortunate that we should have two different Courts interpreting the Constitution of Australia. I do not care at what stage we intervene, but I hold that we ought certainly to intervene, in order to do away with such a position. What harm can result from the passing of this Bill ? Has not an1 individual, a State, or a corporation as great a chance of obtaining justice from our own Court as from the Privy Council ? If any other contention can be put forward in opposition to the Bill, I shall be glad to hear it; but, personally, I would take actioni at the earliest possible moment to insure that our own Court should be the interpreter of the Constitution, and that no tribunal which may be out of harmony with us, or ignorant of our laws or the atmosphere surrounding them, shall be allowed to deal with constitutional questions. I hope that the House will retrace its steps. The snap vote taken before dinner is no criterion of the feeling of honorable members. A great many wee absent at the time, believing that the debate would proceed until the usual hour for the adjournment, and, in view of these facts, I think that we ought to reverse the vote, and to pass this Bill as soon as possible. </para>

            <para>. -In  the few words I propose to utter. I do not intend to add to the heatwhich has been already generated . by continuing or replying to personal recriminations, although the temptation to do so is very great. Nor do I intend to quote articles from leading newspapers. The one question now before the Chair, on the amendment moved by the  deputy  leader of the Opposition, is whether the Judiciary Bill is so urgent that we should deal with it before proceeding with the Tariff, for the settlement of which the whole country is waiting. The Acting Prime Minister, some weeks ago, surprised the House, and, I think, his friends outside, by intimating that, notwithstanding the urgency which had been claimed bv his leader and by his party for dealing with the Tariff, he proposed to interpose at this stage, for some reason which was not definitely stated, the consideration of this Bill, as well as of one or two others. At that time he was told most distinctly, on behalf of the direct Opposition aind of all honorable members in the Opposition corner, that that course was not onlyobjected to, but would be strenuously resisted. Honorable members, like the honorable member for South Sydney, may talk about partytactics and snap votes, but is it not the hypocrisy of party tactics to accuse us of taking anything but a perfectly legitimate step in availing ourselves, as we did, of the first opportunity to resist what we consider an utterly gross mismanagement of parliamentary business? A warning was absolutely given that the step -proposed to be taiken by the Government was, in our opinion, entirely inconsistent with the view they had expressed, not only during the present session, but before, that the -main business to be dealt with during the present session was the Tariff. And now, when the whole of the commercial interests of Australia are in a state of absolute embarrassment, owing to the delay in dealing tVJth the Tariff, this measure has been introduced. We have sought, over and ever again, prior to and during this debate, for any palpable reason, or for the slightest shadow of foundation for the statement that there is any urgency in regard to the passing of this Bill. I have listened to the speech made by the Attorney-General, and must say that he rather amused me, and I think several others. There is not a more good-natured, kindly gentleman in theHouse than is the honorable member, and the spectacle of his trying to lash himself into a fury was one of the most amusing I have witnessed since I have been in this House. There is a French expression, which I may be pardoned for using in this connexion - <inline font-style="italic">un mouton enrage</inline> - an angry sheep. A sheep is one of the mildest and most useful of animals, and when it tries to lash itself into a fury it becomes one of the most ridiculous. I . ventured to ask my kindly friend the Attorney-General, whilst he was indulging in one of his flights of indignant oratory, to define the particular urgency of this measure. His reply was that there are two Courts at present dealing with appeals under the Constitution. But I would point out that there have been two Courts dealing with those appeals ever since our Constitution was inaugurated. There were two Courts dealing with them at the time the Prime Minister declared that the Tariff would be the first measure brought forward this session. </para>

              <para>- Does the AttorneyGeneral mean the Privy Council decision in the case of <inline font-style="italic">Webb</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Outtrim ?</inline> If so, may I point out to him that this Bill does not affect that decision in the slightest degree ? It allows it to have exactly the full force that it has now. Is it not paltering with the whole question and with the interests of the people of the country, who look to us to do their business for them, to pretend that &#39;there is any urgency about this measure? I say that it. is the merest pretence. After the warning which the Government received, not merely upon the occasion mentioned by the Acting Prime Minister, when they were told on behalf of both sections of the Opposition that the interpolation of this business would be strenuously resisted, but also upon Friday last, it is simply the hypocrisy of party tactics to pretend for a moment that there is any justification for the attacks which have been made to-night upon member&#39;s on this side of the House. Great as the tempta- &#39; tion may be, I am not going to hurl back such epithets as were applied to us by the Acting Prime Minister. When such a speech is made as that which he delivered prior to the adjournment for dinner, the ordinary feelings of human beings are subjected to a very great strain. It is humiliating to- us all to have to listen to such language, but it would be more humiliating still if we replied to it in the same strain. </para>

            <para>.-Iquite sympathize with the desire of the Opposition to proceed with the consideration of the Tariff. Had they manifested that desire during the past five or six weeks I certainly should have supported the proposal oif the  deputy  leader of the Opposition this evening. Even if that proposal had been put forward as a business proposition instead of as a party move, I should have voted for it, but knowing that there has been a movement upon foot to&#39; defeat the Government, I shall oppose it. The Ministry, we must recollect, are the administrative and therefore responsible body, and I will not be a party to anything which is not fair, open, and above-board in dealing with them. </para>

            <para>.I think that an intense anxiety to serve one&#39;s country is being manifested at the present moment. I can only recall one measure in regard to which such a lively interest has been exhibited during the current session, that was the Bill in which we agreed to increase our own salaries. That measure appealed to me very strongly. I. was present, as we all were, in the Chamber during the whole period that it was under consideration, and I can onlyassume that a question not less important is under review just now. But, as I do not happen to be in it, I am naturally a little anxious and also a little suspicious. When I see the very lively and intelligent interest exhibited in this question by honorable members opposite - an interest which is perhaps more lively than intelligent - and when I find that for the first time in the history of this Parliament, they are all travelling in the same direction - a consummation &#34; devoutly to be wished,&#34; but which hitherto has been unattainable - I am bound to think that there must be something more in the wind than is conveyed by the simple statement that &#34; the honorable member for Parramatta rose at a convenient stage and moved that the debate upon the Judiciary Bill should be resumed after the Tariff has been disposed of.&#34; No doubt it is not the adjournment of the debate upon that measure which is desired, so much as the removal from office of the present Government. </para>

              <para>- I am very anxious to proceed with the consideration of the Tariff - indeed we are all anxious to do so. But the adoption of this motion will not bring us any nearer the attainment of that object, and I make the sporting offer to honorable members opposite that if they are prepared to make a. definite statement as to the kind of Tariff they will introduce if they should attain Ministerial office, I will consider it. Further, if it be a reasonable and workable Tariff, I will vote for it in preference to that which has been submitted by the Government, because I am perfectlyfree upon this matter. As is well known, I am in favour of something which I fear will scarcely commend itself to members of the Opposition corner, who at this particular moment have assumed an importance which heretofore thev have not possessed in the eyes of anybodv but themselves. I lielieve that it would be a good thing for the country if we had in operation a system, of land values taxation. I am very sure that no honorable member of the Opposition corner believes that. I see, sir, that vou are about to call me to order. But I think that some latitude should be extended to a man who has been mdelv snatched from his home and plunged into the middle of a discussion of the merits of which he knows nothing, and cares less. Therefore, I have a right to point out the reasons which actuate me in this matter - reasons which are common to every honorable member. I agree with those who say that we ought to proceed with the consideration of the Tariff at the earliest possible moment. But one of the reasons why we have not proceeded with it is that during the past three weeks honorable members opposite have done nothing but talk endlessly and generally irrelevantly upon every subject under the sun. I have just taken up <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> - a thing whichI rarely do, and which I would not dream of doing except under the doctor&#39;s orders - and the first name which catches my eve is that of the honorable member for Hunter, who has spread himself over quite a number of columns without any provocation whatever. He spoke at almost interminable length about something which was quite unimportant, or at any rate not urgent, and that fact so irritated the honorable member for Lang, that he immediately rose and said almost the same thing in the same words. </para>

            <para>. - I must bear my testimony to the clearness with whichthe Attorney-General introduced the measure, and the evident care which he has devoted to the subject with which it deals, which is, of course, of paramount importance. While I agree with him that the Australian High Court ought to be the final Court of appeal, I regret thatthat is not to be provided for by an amendment of the Constitution, instead of by a method which it is somewhat below the level of the relations to a very great  subject. Honorable members who were in the last Parliament will recollect that when, by the Judiciary Bill of 1 903, an attempt was made to cut down appeals to the Privy Council by declaring that the Federal jurisdiction vested by us in the Courts of the States was to be conditioned by the provision that all appeals were to be taken to the High Court, some of us described it as an attempt to cure, by a somewhat sinister procedure, a blunder made by the members of the Convention in their final division. The Attorney-General then said that the Government were trying to get back to theposition in which the matter, but for that would have been left at the Melbourne session of the Convention. &#34; Yes,&#34; I replied, &#34; but by a sinister method.&#34; There is no doubt that this is an attempt to cancel the bungling of the Convention in its last division. It was alleged then with equal certainty to that now affecting the Ministerial mind, that the method of cutting down appeals to the Privy Council, adopted in clause 39 of the Judiciary Bill, was certain of success; but we now find that it has failed. The then member for Northern Melbourne, now <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins, and myself, strongly held the view that the provision would not prove a success; but the present Prime Minister, who was then Attorney-General, and the present Attorney-General, with others, declared that it would effect what was intended. I mention these facts now because the present allegation, that this method will be a success, is to be discounted by remembering that it was asserted with equal certainty <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> 1903 that the procedure then proposed would be efficacious. On page 1203 of volume XIII. of our <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reports, the Prime Minister is made to say - </para>

That is what is sought to be done in this clause. First of all, we absorb in the High Court the whole of the Federal jurisdiction, and then invest the States Court with it, subject to certain conditions. </para>

          <para class="block">The Privy Council has now decided that it is not. Amongst other points then taken by honorable members was this : that while we could abolish by the method adopted, or by any other, the right of appeal given by Statute to a particular Court, we could not take away the appeal as of grace to the Privy Council, and that the particular appeal in question was not given by the Parliament of the &#39; Commonwealth. It was decided in a  Canadian case - <inline font-style="italic">Cushing</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Dupuy</inline> -  5 app. cases, page 409, thatthe Parliament which gives a right of appeal by Statute can take it away, but that it cannot take away appeals to the King in Council not given by it, or existing as a matter of grace. It has been pointed out in the case of the <inline font-style="italic">Commissioners of Taxation v. Baxter,</inline> 4 C.L.R., which has led to the introduction of the measure, that it was never contemplated by the Parliament which passed the Judiciary Act of 1903 to take away all leave to appeal to the Privy Council, that all that was attempted, and that all that could be accomplished, was to take away appeals as of right. During the debates in connexion with that measure, no word was uttered by any legal member or any one else, as far as I remember, as to it being intended that the scope of section 39 should be limited to the abolition or cutting down of appeals as of right. It may be a little tedious, but I should like, in order that the facts may be put on record once for all, to draw attention to the genesis of the appeal clauses. As I said on a previous occasion, during a debate on judicial matters, the trouble which has existed during the last three or fouryears, through the clashing of jurisdiction, and the adoption of sinister  methods to take away an appeal to the Privy Council given by the Constitution, is the result of a mistake made by the Convention in its last division during the Melbourne session of 1898. The appeal clauses were dealt with only in Adelaide and in Melbourne, and at the end of the Adelaide sitting the draft Bill contained an express provision abolishing direct appeals to the Privy Council from the Courts of the States, and, in fact, all appeals, with one exception. All appeals in State matters, and all appeals in Federal matters, to the Privy Council were abolished!/ except in such questions as involved the public interests of the Commonwealth, or of any State, or of  any  other part of Her Majesty&#39;s dominions. The clause read - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>No apnea 1 shall be allowed to the Queen in Council from any Court of any State or from the High Court or any Federal Court, except that the Queen may, in any matter in which the public interests of the Commonwealth, or of any State or of any other part of Her Majesty&#39;s Dominions are concerned, grant leave to appeal to the Queen in Council from the High Court. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">So that, .as settled in Adelaide, we had really attained the Australian idea of judicial independence, except in matters in which the public&#39; interests of other&#39; parts of  His  Majesty&#39;s Dominions, of the Commonwealth, or of any State, were concerned, in regard to which an appeal was left by permission to the Privy Council. But that permission, except in important cases, would not Be granted. Practically we had affirmed the principle of complete Australian control of Australian litigation. The matter cropped up again in the Convention on the nth March, 1898. After a long debate, the Convention decided to retain the appeal to the Privy Council. The original provision for the purpose was that all appeals in constitutional matters to the Privy Council, except those touching the public interests mentioned, were abolished j the clause which accomplished that was1 taken in hand by the Drafting Committee, and as it emerged from their deliberation it was changed, not only in expression, but in substance. The clause, as it passed the Convention - that is, clause 75A  - provided that, notwithstanding anything in the last section, an appeal to the Queen in Council from, any Court of ? State&#34;, or from the High Court, or from any other Federal Court, should not be allowed in a matter in which the interpretation of the Constitution, or of the Constitution of a State, was involved, unless in matters in which the public interests of any part of Her Majesty&#39;s &#39; dominions, other than the Commonwealth, or of a State, were involved. That clause expressly negatived the direct appeal, both of right and by permission, from a State Court on matters involving the interpretation of the Constitution. I may mention that many important clauses  were  re-drafted by the Drafting Committee, and were formally passed just before the Convention finally met. As that clause was re-drafted by the Drafting Committee, and formally passed it appeared in this shape - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>No appeal shall be permitted to the Queen in Council in any matter involving the interpretation of this Constitution or of the Constitution of a State unless the public interests of some part of Her Majesty&#39;s Dominions other than the Commonwealth or of a State are involved. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">And then there was a provision that an appeal might be granted by leave in other cases from the High Court. But the clause as re-drafted, unfortunately, did not expressly negative the direct appeal in constitutional matters from the Courts of the States ; and the result was that the direct appeal was left open, in the opinion of leading lawyers, as the Convention finally settled the Constitution. I made a futile attempt to cure the drafting of clause 7 5 a, for which that was substituted, and whose imperfections as to the direct appeal in State matters it retained. Honorable members will find the debate on this point reporte&#39;d on page 2516 of the Reports of the Melbourne Convention ; and at pages 2439 and 2453 I drew attention to the effect of the final draft itself. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgins,</inline> the present Justice of the High Court, who was a representative of Victoria, I think afterwards pointed out in this House that the direct appeal was left open, not only in ordinary general matters, but also in constitutional matters. <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> tabled an . amendment in the Convention, which, had it been carried, would have abolished all direct appeals from the Courts of the States, whether in State, or Federal matters.  Asthe Convention had decided to retain some appeals to the Privy Council  beyond  those in which the public interests of any part of Her Majesty&#39;s Dominions other than the Commonwealth, or a State, were concerned, the clause would have retained appeals in general matters, and in constitutional matters, from the judgment of the High Court to the Privy Council. But the effect would.  have been that all appeals must have gone from the Courts of the States and the Federal Courts to the High Court, and then from the High Court only by permission to the Privy Council. The result, judging by Canadian experience, would have been that all appeals, whether in State . or Federal constitutional  matters, would have been finally determined by the High Court. We should have had an appeal as of grace to the Privy Council, but, judging by the practice of the Privy Council as applied to appeals from the Supreme Court of Canada, an appeal would have been allowed only in very exceptional cases, so that, although, as a recognition of the Empire, there would have been an appeal, in 99 per cent, of the cases the judgment of the High Court would have been final, only exceptional cases being taken to the Privy Council. But there could have been no clashing of* jurisdiction, because there would not have been, as at present, &#39; practically two co-ordinate Courts of final appeal. Unfortunately, the position was not realized, and the amendment was lost by the small majority of three. Since then, various attempts have been made to get out of the unfortunate position in which we were landed by the double appeal being left open. The Premiers&#39; Conference of 1899 had its attention drawn to the fact that the double, appeal was open, and was asked that it should be abolished. The Parliament of New South Wales, T think, sent a request to that Premiers&#39; Conference, that appeals from the Supreme Courts of the States should be made uniform, namely, that appeals should be either to the Privy Council or to the High Court, and not, as at present, indiscriminately to either. However, the matter was ignored; in fact, the Premiers did not realize the fact that the double appeal still existed. Therefore, as the Constitution Bill was adopted at the referendum, it contains the provision for an appeal direct from a. State Court in all State matters not of Federal jurisdiction. There was an appeal also from the High Court to the Privy Council, except in certain constitutional matters ; but the direct appeal in constitutional matters was still open, from the Courts of the States. The amendments made by the Imperial Parliament in the Constitution directly declared the retention of appeals from the Courts of the States, not only in general matters, which need not have been, and were not, touched, as they were beyond all dispute, but in constitutional matters, and also granted an appeal in constitutional matters from the High Court, which appeal, except where the public interest of other parts of the Empire were concerned, had been abolished by the Constitution up to that time. When the delegates went Home, there really was not a very fundamental matter involved in the amendments suggested by the Imperial Government. The public of Australia thought it was a question of the absolute independence of the Australian Judiciary, or the retention of appeal to the Privy Council. But that was not so ; and, in a letter in the <inline font-style="italic">South Australian Register,</inline> on the 19th June, 1900, after the final form had been settled, I pointed out that in all matters of constitutional interpretation, even in -cases in which the constitutionality of any State or Federal Act in relation to Imperial law was in question, the consent of the High Court was not required - that questions of mere construction, which were by far the more frequent, were open to unconditional appeal, and that all the judgments of the States Courts might be challenged bv direct appeal . Just before the clauses were finally settled at Home, there was an attempt made to come to a compromise, which, had it been accepted, would really have abolished direct constitutional appeals from the Courts of the States. </para>

          <para class="block">That clause, as I say, abolished direct appeals in constitutional matters. It left an appeal from the High Court open in <inline font-style="italic">inter se</inline> matters, but only with the consent of the Executive, and also an appeal in general constitutional matters with the permission of the Privy Council - which would very seldom be granted - and it gave Parliament the power to cut down appeals by leave from the High Court, and, practically, to eventually abolish them. The strongest objection urged against the clause was the somewhat unfortunate provision that it placed the appeal in <inline font-style="italic">inter se</inline> matters in the hands of the Executive rather than in the hands of the High Court itself. The effect of the clause was pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith in an interview which was published in the Australian press.

It is to cure the unfortunate mistakes that were made in this regard that attempts have been1 made under the Judiciary Act of  1903  and the present Bill to prevent appeals reaching the Privy Council. In the final sitting of the Convention I tabled an amendment to send all appeals from the High Court to the Privy Council &#39; by leave. There was also a provision in my amendment that the Federal Parliament should at any time have power to cut off these appeals to the Home tribunal. Look-, ing through the report of the proceedings of the Imperial Conference, I find that it adopted, on the motion of General Botha, a provision- as regards South African appeals which is practically identical with the amendment moved by me and lost in the Convention. </para>

              <para>- Yes. The provision was that the appeal by permission of the Court, or as of grace, was to be preserved . through the Court of Appeal - that all direct appeals were to be abolished. But there was implied a provision, I think, that even the right of appeal from the Supreme Court to the Privy Council could be cut down by the local Parliament. As a matter of fact, the general principle of autonomy in judicial matters was recognised in the resolution carried at the instance of General Botha. That shows what is reallypossible. The object of this Bill is to abolish in <inline font-style="italic">inter se</inline> matters appeals to the Privy Council. My opinion is that such an important change -in the relations of the Empire ought to be effected by an express amendment of the Constitution. Although we may have the- technical power to take this step - and I think it is probable we can accomplish it by the method adopted - I do not consider we ought to use a technical power existing under the Constitution to practically destroy an arrangement deliberately arrived at when the compromise was effected at Home. The Secretary of State for the Colonies cabled to the Governors of the Australian Colonies, in June, 1900, the effect of that arrangement, and honorable members will find from a perusal of the cablegram that it was understood by the Home authorities and by the delegates from Australia that the direct appeal was retained. If we had deliberately agreed to an amendment of the Constitution under which the right of direct appeal to the Privy Council in constitutional matters was retained, it would be scarcely honest to use a technical power to destroy the arrangement to which I have referred - the technical power to, by making the original jurisdiction of the High Court exclusive, cut off an approach to the Privy Council. </para>

              <para>- I do not, because, as I have already shown by quoting clause 74, which the Secretary of State for the Colonies was willing to adopt, the principle of abolishing the right of direct appeal in constitutional matters was agreed to. Unfortunately, the Premiers in Conference did not realize the effect of that clause, and remonstrances were made on behalf of various States against the abolition of the right of direct appeal. Whether rightly or wrongly, the Home Government considered it to be the deliberate opinion of the people of these States that for some time the right of direct appeal on constitutional matters should be retained.

              <para>- And the only effectual way, as  I hope later on to show. The cablegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies also set forth that the delegates unanimously adopted the resolution. If they did, they, to some extent, spoke on behalf of Australia. Unfortunately, like many others, they did not altogether apprehend the full significance of what was done. Whether we adopt the method of removal incorporated in this Bill or the other method of vesting in the High Court exclusive jurisdiction in all these matters, the objections I have offered are equally applicable. I do not wish to be technical in dealing with this question, but I should like to mention that it may be somewhat doubtful whether we can accomplish the object in view. When the Constitution was passed, the Courts  of  the States had power to decide questions arising under any laws that we passed. It they arose in the course of litigation, they were bound to give their opinions upon them.

Thus, a legal or equitable right, acquired under State laws, may be prosecuted in the State Courts, and also if the parties reside in different States, in the Federal Courts. So rights, whether legal or equitable, acquired under the laws of the United States, may be prosecuted in the United States Courts, or in the State Courts, competent to decide rights of the like character and class, subject, however, to this qualification, that where the .right arises under a law of the United States, Congress may, if it see fit, give to the Federal Courts exclusive jurisdiction. </para>

          <para>I think that this quotation has an educational bearing on the Bill before us. It clearly points out that, apart altogether from any grant by Congress - or in the case of Australia bv the Commonwealth Parliament - States Courts have jurisdic-  tion to decide matters involving the interpretation of the Federal Constitution arising under laws passed by Congress. .But the judgment lays down that, in these matters, Congress may declare the jurisdiction to be exclusive, and so far,  I  think, we have a recognition of, at all events, the technical power to accomplish what is aimed at in this Bill, by taking away from the States Courts all jurisdiction, in order to cut off an approach to the Privy Council. We have a recognition of the power, although it is not absolutely certain that such a step may be successfully taken. If we turn to the Commonwealth Constitution, we find that it is bv no means clear that the power exists to declare the jurisdiction of the High Court exclusive in relation to <inline font-style="italic">inter se</inline> matters under sections  76  and  77. </para>

But I know that opinions may be held with fair reason that the only, jurisdiction which we can touch under section 77 is the Federal jurisdiction conferred by Parliament in the exercise of the constitutional powers granted to it. That is a jurisdiction which, having been conferred by the Parliament, may equally be taken away by it. Upon thispoint, I wish to refer to the American case of <inline font-style="italic">Claflin</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Housemen,</inline> and to quote a passage, which is somewhat significant - </para>

This is true as to jurisdiction depending on United States authority : but the same jurisdiction existed (at least to a certain extent) under the authority of the States. </para>

          <para class="block">The judgment then goes on to expound the position. I merely quote this extract with a view to showing that in that judgment a distinction was drawn between jurisdiction which is inherent and jurisdiction which is conferred, though practically both have the same result. These are merely suggestions upon my part, but upon the whole I do not think that they interfere with the probability that we can, by the exercise of a technical power, cut off from litigants in some cases the approach to the Privy Council as a Court of appeal. </para>

It is a doubtful way of achieving it, and as there is no urgency in connexion with the matter, it will be far better for us to reconsider the question of appeals to the Privy Council by a direct amendment of the Constitution upon the lines foreshadowed in an amendment which I submitted to the Federal Convention, and which, according to the treatment meted out to a motion submitted by General Botha to the Imperial Conference, would now be accepted by the Imperial Government. </para>

              <para>- I think that a majority of the electors of Australia - owing to the way in which the matter was presented to them - believed that the fight between our delegates and the Imperial authorities was one between judicial independence and its opposite. The point upon which I have been dwelling is that we never did get that recognition as the result of the drafting of the Convention, though probably the people assumed that we did. Another objection which I entertain to this measure is that it really involves our going back upon the views expressed by honorable members in 1903, when the Judiciary Bill was under consideration. We then thought that the High Court ought to be a tribunal of appellate and original jurisdiction. An attempt to give it a very large measure of original jurisdiction was defeated by a substantial majority, and, as a matter of fact, original jurisdiction in constitutional mattersis still vested in the Courts of the States. This Bill does not take away original jurisdiction from those Courts in matters involving the interpretation of the Constitution so long as they are not matters <inline font-style="italic">inter se</inline> within the meaning of section 74. The policy of vesting the High Court with a large measure of original jurisdiction was strongly condemned during the debate which took place upon the Judiciary Bill in 1903. </para>

Very little was said of it as a Court of original jurisdiction. </para>

              <para>- There is no doubt about that. Nevertheless, it is bue that very strong objection was urged in 1903 to the large original jurisdiction proposed to be conferred upon the High Court by the Judiciary Bill in its original form. The general current of opinion was then in favour of making that tribunal a Court of Appeal, instead of one with large powers of original jurisdiction. Strong speeches in that direction were made by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Josiah</inline> Symon, who ought to speak with authority, seeing that he acted as  Chairman  of the Judicial Committee of the Federal Convention. This consideration, however, is quite apart from the question of the merits of the decision of the Privy Council in the case of <inline font-style="italic">Webb</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Outtrim,</inline> or of that of the High Court. It would perhaps be presumption upon my part to question the decision given by either of these tribunals. If I may venture an opinion, I think that the Privy Council was right in the conclusion at which it arrived, although, so far as the reasons advanced by Lord Halsbury for arriving at that conclusion were concerned, it was, in some respects, very much wrong. Indeed, I think that the <inline font-style="italic">Law Quarterly Review</inline> of last April expressed a very strong opinion in the same direction. &#39; To the editor &#34;of that review it seemed incomprehensible that Lord Halsbury could have come to tha. conclusion which he did: - and which the <inline font-style="italic">Review</inline> accepted as correct - upon premises which, so far as their significance &#39; could be realized did not sustain that conclusion. So far as the Privy Council sought to introduce a fundamental distinction between the American and the Australian Constitutions, as to the power to declare laws unconstitutional, I think that its position was untenable. The reasoning of the High Court upon the whole seems correct,, but some of us think with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Isaacs and, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins that the application to ,the facts of the principle laid down in <inline font-style="italic">Mcculloch</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Maryland</inline> was wrong, In the exceedingly able judgment which he delivered, in the case of <inline font-style="italic">The New.

          <para class="block">He then quotes authorities upon the point which seem to be fairly conclusive, at thesame time insisting in the words of the Earl of Selborne, that &#34; the principle must be confined within the limits of what is recognised as its assumed necessity.&#34; That is really the whole point upon which thequestion hangs. I very much &#39;question whether the High Court is not pushing the application of the principle laid down by Chief Justice Marshall in his decision in 1 81 9 under conditions which were somewhat different from our own, far beyond reasonable limits. In a very lucid article contributed to one of the American Reviews byMr. Justice Higgins when he was a member of this House - and I think that a similar, article appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Law Review</inline> - he points out that the principle laid down in that case is not applicable to our own circumstances. He expresses the opinion not only that the application of the principle embodied in that decision was unnecessary to our conditions, but also that it ought not to have been the decision of the Court in America.  It seems, to me that we are pushing that principle to absurd lengths. There is a good deal of. force in the statement that we have the political check power of disallowance which is vested in the Crownwhen Bills are reserved upon the advice of the Executive of the Privy Council. It mav be that mistakes have been made by the Privy Council in relation to our Constitution. At the same time, I think that similar mistakes were made by the High Court in dealing with a point pressed in the case of <inline font-style="italic">D&#39; Emden</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Pedder.</inline> In making an analysis of the decision at the time, I noticed&#34; that the Chief Justice referred to the point, that, when the&#39; question of necessity is considered, there is a difference between the American and Australian Constitutions, arising out of the fact that there are some checks  behind the Australian States anc?  the Commonwealth which do not exist in connexion with the relations of the. American States and the Federation, one of them being the power of disallowance. He said that - &#39; </para>
          <para>It is, however, the duty of the Court, not of the Executive Government, to determine the validity of an attempted exercise of the legislative power. </para>
          <para class="block">The validity of the exercise of legislative power need not be considered bv the body which advises the King in regard to the disallowance of Bills. It is one of the things to be considered, but no judicial decision was ever given by the Privy Council in the matter, or by the advisers of  His  Majesty. All they have to consider is whether a Bill ought, as a matter of policy, to be passed. When, according to the advice given to the Crown, there is an Interference with the rights of a State - and the principle applied to the Colonies before Federation - when one State, by passing laws of .extra territorial application, interferes with the rights of another, the question of disallowance may be considered from that point of view, although no legal decision is given in regard to it. As a matter of fact, under the instructions that were given, and I think are still given, to the Governors of the States, if not to the Governor-General, if a Bill seems to be extra-territorial in its operation it must be reserved for the Royal assent. The general question considered in connexion with disallowance is policy, from the point of view not always of local, but of extra-territorial effect. It seems to me, therefore, that there was a misapprehension when it was stated that the Executive Government is not the body that ought to determine the validity of an attempted exercise of the legislative power, as that is the necessary way of insisting that the right of disallowance is a check.

              <para>- No. It is only one of the matters which may be considered, but it is not the chief ground for disallowing or assenting to a Bill. On Sunday night I looked again through the celebrated American decision in the case of <inline font-style="italic">Mcculloch</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Maryland.</inline> It seems to me that the class of instrumentalities has been extended by that decision beyond the necessities of the case. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins, in an article to which I have referred, has expressed the opinion that those instrumentalities which are not: to be touched by the State and the Commonwealth respectively are such as are necessary to the existence of the power affected. But the decision in the case of <inline font-style="italic">McCulloch</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Maryland</inline> is that even instrumentalities that are necessary, in the sense of being convenient, but not indispensable, are protected. At the end of that decision there is a somewhat significant mention of the fact that, if a uniform law had been applied, say, to the taxation of land held by one of the Federal instrumentalities, or a State instrumentality, touching the land of the Commonwealth or the State, and others, it would not at all follow that it would not be legal. -What the scope of that qualification was I cannot clearly see, but it has been relied upon in subsequent cases in which the application of the principles of <inline font-style="italic">McCulloch</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Maryland</inline> were called in question. I do not presume to make more than a few suggestions on this  point, in connexion with the trend of Australian decisions. It may seem that we occasionally err in too pedantically following the decisions of American Courts, or adopting principles which may be vital in the case of . a Constitution like that of America, but are not absolutely necessary for the maintenance of the relations of the Australian States with&#39; the Commonwealth. I have suggested that&#39; the true method of dealing with this .matter is. by an amendment of the Constitution. &#39; That may involve delay; but there is no great hurry, and there is a second method available. Most of our appeals take place under Orders of Council passed under the Privy Council Acts, 3 and 4, William IV., chapter 41, and the amending Act, 7 and 8 Victoria, chapter 69. The first provided for appeals to the Privy Council from Courts of Error, or practically from what were Courts of final jurisdiction, and the amending Act extended them to any Courts. . The power of the Crown, might grant an appeal direct from a subordinate Court as of grace. In many cases we could cut down appeals by changing the Orders in Council under which they take place. That might not be a nice thing to ask the Imperial Government to do, but I believe that we could limit appeals from the States Courts merely in that way. </para>

              <para>- I do not deny that, nor does it arise from anything I am saying. I am with the honorable member in his aspiration to have these matters settled by the High Court; and I am endeavouring to suggest a symmetrical principle whereby that may be arranged. But we ought npt, by doing something which completely - ignores our relations with the Home Government, to cut off the appeal which was agreed to by the delegates who were sent Home. If we wish to have something done before the Constitution can be amended - and only the question of expense need be considered, because I believe that the Parliament would pass the measure necessary to sanction a referendum -we could ask the Imperial Government to alter the Orders in Council, and thus cut off all direct appeals on matters affecting the Constitution. That that would be agreed to is, I think, made pretty evident by afew considerations. I have already mentioned the opinions of &#34;such, jurists as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. &#39;</inline> Dicey. I have given the resolutions of the Imperial Conference, which practically declare for the principle of judicial autonomy. The scope of the proposed new clause  74,  which was rejected just before the final arrangement was come to at Home in  1900,  is in the same direction. Besides that, if honorable members will read the speech made by the present Prime Minister of England during a debate on the Bill in the House of Commons, they will see that the aspirations of Australia in this matter have been explicitly recognised </para>

            <para>We have heard of opinions, in favour of retaining the appeal to the Privy Council, but the question at issue is - are we prepared to allow the people of Australia to interpret the instrument which they themselves have framed ? (Hear, hear.) . . . Why should it be so dangerous to leave the interpretation of the Commonwealth Act to those best acquainted with the circumstances and the state- of feeling out of which it has arisen? (Cheers.) Surely those who have framed it, who have seen the growth of the whole question, know what was intended when the Act was passed by the Australian people, and are better able to judge of the spirit and intention than persons who, though, perhaps, more learned, have no such acquaintance with local feeling? (Hear, hear.) It is enough for me to say- in the meantime that, even if all that legal ingenuity can urge in favour of the step taken by the Government were true, there still would remain the formidable objection that even if it were a desirable thing to accomplish, and even if there were some little prospective danger to be warded off, it is not worth the consequences that may follow from the step the Government are taking. For the sake of asmall technical point - in order to overcome a difficulty that might be otherwise met - we are to break in upon a solemn instrument which represents not only the will of the Australian people, but a covenant and contract entered into by the Colonies among themselves. We are to deprive our action of  the grace attaching to a hearty reception ; we sow the seeds of complaint and dissatisfaction little favorable to lasting unity. (Hear, hear.) Therefore, as far as we on this side of the House are concerned, we will not be parties to taking the line the Government propose. </para>

          <para class="block">I said also that the present adjustment was not a misapprehension; at all events, that we relied on the terms of the cablegram to the Governors of the States from the Secretary of State for the Colonies, on the 17th June, 1900. Again, it was pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain, Mr. Haldane,</inline> and others in 1900, that we should not abolish altogether appeals to the Privy Council, because it was then in contemplation to establish a new appellate tribunal. But. so far as I can gather from the reports of the Imperial Conference, and from what has taken place during the last five or six years, that idea has been given up; and I do not think that there is the remotest likelihood of such a Court being established. The present Lord Chancellor of England is not in favour of such a tribunal ; and his speech&#34; on the  Question  ought to be quite conclusive. That proposed appellate Court was one of the great reasons given for the retention of appeals to the Privy Council ; but, as I say, the proposal has been practically shelved. Again, in 1874, when the question of abolishing appeals from the Irish Courts to the House of Lords arose, the objection came, not from the Home Government, but from the Bar of Ireland. The Home Government were prepared, in a matter of almost quite as much importance to the Empire as our relations to the Privy Council, to abolish Irish appeals to the House of Lords, but objection was taken by a strong representative meeting of the Bar. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hempbell,</inline> Q.C., one of the principal speakers, did not wish to abolish appeals, but rather that the House of Lords should contain more members representative of Irish jurisprudence, so that there might be some knowledge of local laws when appeals relating to purely Irish matters were heard. That gentleman said that the English Judges were altogether ignorant of many of the Irish questions, which, from time to time, came up for adjudication.. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Hodges, in referring to <inline font-style="italic">Marshall</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">The Colonial Bank,</inline> I think drew attention to the necessity for having one final Court of Appeal.

              <para>-  Than that the law should be right, the honorable member means. <inline font-weight="bold">&#34;Mr. GLYNN.</inline> - No; I think there was irony in the remark. The particular appeal came from a single Judge through the Supreme Court of Victoria; at all events, whether the High Court was wrong or not, what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Hodges desired was that the alternative appeal should be abolished, and that there should be only one Court of Appeal for Australian matters. I do not think, that the method now proposed will really settle the clashing of jurisdiction between the High Court and the Privy Council. All that we shall do will be to declare that whenever a decision is given by the High Court it is to be obligatory on the litigants. But the Privy Council may be called upon, in some cases, to give its opinion; and it will not be likely to alter its opinion in order to follow the decision of the High Court. A question may arise whether the case is one of <inline font-style="italic">inter se</inline> or not, and, further, a question may be raised in the English Courts. In the course of English litigation  an Australian Act ma.y come up for consideration, and Australian rights mav be affected; but the English Courts will be guided by the decision of the Privy Council, and not bv the decision of the Australian High Court.

          <para>Word  as to the decision in <inline font-style="italic">Parkin</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">James.</inline> It was decided by the High Court that there is a direct appeal, practically stereotyped by the Constitution, from the decisions of the Supreme Court&#39; -of the&#39; States in State matters, even though the jurisdiction may be exercised by a &#34;single Judge in chambers, so long as his decision is final. I think that that decision was the result of the drafting in the Convention. Under section  73  of the Constitution, and as it stood then, it was competent for the Federal Parliament to abolish appeals,  not  only in Federal matters, but in State matters, from the Supreme Courts of the States. So that when eventually appeals to the Privy Council are cut off the Federal Parliament might cut off appeals- in State matters from the States Courts, and thus leave the Courts of the States without any appellate tribunal. In other words, the appeal to the Privy Council will have gone, and the Federal Parliament could have abolished the appeals from the States Courts ; and &#39; I said that that was not a provision that ought to remain in the Constitution in view of &#39; the American authorities as to how it will oper-ate. What I asked should be done was that a provision should be made that wherever appeal lay to the Privy Council on the establishment of the Commonwealth , an appeal ought to lie to the High Court until, in State matters,&#39; the States Parliaments abolished it, and, in Federal matters the Federal Parliament, abolished it&#39;.- Honorable members will see that the question whether there should be  an  appeal beyond the Supreme Courts of the States in purely State matters ought&#39; to be decided by the Parliaments of the States, and that the question whether there should be an appeal in Federal matters from the States Courts to the High Court, or to what extent that appeal should be preserved, ought to be decided by the Federal Parliament After several efforts I succeeded in getting the Drafting Committee to take up the question, but, unfortunately, the amendment which I suggested, when it was redrafted by the&#39; Drafting Committee, emerged in another form, and with another effect. . As the provision now stands in the Constitution, it stereotypes every appeal then existing from the Supreme Court of a State to the Privy Council as an appeal to the High Court. No power is vested even iri the Federal Parliament or in any of the States Parliaments to abolish any of these appeals. That power should not be given to the Federal Parliament in State matters, but should have been given <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> State matters to the States Parliaments. The unfortunate position also in which we are landed - if it is unfortunate, and some think it is - under which a good deal of the jurisdiction of the States Courts may be taken away by the operation of thedecision in <inline font-style="italic">Parkin</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">James,</inline> is a consequence, not of deliberate intentionon the part of members of the Convention, but of an unfortunate error in drafting.! That ought to be borne in view in any attempt that may be made to alter the effect of the decision in <inline font-style="italic">Parkin</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">James.</inline> I have spoken somewhat hurriedly on a technical subject, and I will say nomore, as the hour is late, and I do not wish to leave anything I have to say to another day. At present, at all events, I cannot say that I intend to oppose the Bill. . My chief object was to impress upon the Government the greater desirableness of adopting another course, which would be more consistent with our position or. our relations to the Home Government, and quite as efficacious, in connexion with a fundamental alteration of the Constitution, and. greater in its scope. It would clearly establish the final jurisdiction of the High Court in all matters, which, of course, will not be done by simply taking away the original jurisdiction of the States Courts. But if we. do not wait, or do not wish at once to incur the expense of an amendment of the Constitution, there is another way open, which I have suggested- by asking the Imperial Government, which in this matter could then co-operate with us - and it would be a much smoother way of accomplishing what we intend - under the provisions of the Privy Council Act, to vary the Orders in Council and cut off these appeals. </para>

              <para>- The Government propose to carry the Bill through to-hight, and have the numbers. If they choose to take the responsibility &#39; on their shoulders, I am going to allow them to do so. I shall merely give a few reasons why they should not do as they propose. The idea is that this Bill is going to simplify litigation. It will do nothing of the kind. It will increase the expense of the public, and create great difficulties. Questions .such, for instance, as the rating of a civil servant for his house property may arise. Such a case may come before the &#39;States Courts, and the question will be raised by some lawyer that it is a matter of Federal jurisdiction with which the States Courts have no power to deal. That will probably mean that all the litigation that has been carried on in connexion with that case for some time will be invalid. Some question may arise as to the stamping of documents as between New South Wales and Victoria, or between Western Australia and South Australia. </para>

              <para>- That is quite true,, as my honorable friend suggests. It may be held that the State Court has no jurisdiction whatever after litigation has been pending for, perhaps, twelve months. The expenses of litigation in the High Court are much greater, and the fees and charges are much higher, than in the States Courts. </para>

          <para class="block">It is proposed to confer certain forms of jurisdiction on the Federal Court alone. Counsel&#39;s fees are higher in the Federal Court, and the delays are greater. I do not think that if the number of judges were doubled, they would be sufficient to carry out the work which the Government propose to put on their shoulders. In view&#39; of all these points, it would be wise for the Government to take a little more time to consider the question, and to give honorable members also an opportunity of considering it. </para>

              <para>- I think if he had listened to the honorable member for Angas, he would have understood it, and changed his mind as to voting for the Bill, had he intended to vote for it. He would have said that the proper way of dealing with the question is to amend the Constitution. The Bill will not do away with appeals to the Privy Council. Questions will be sure to&#39; go to that body. I doubt very much if we can take away from the States Courts, or from the States themselves, powers that are granted to them under their own Constitutions. They have their own  separate powers, with which I doubt whether the Bill will successfully interfere. But it will raise any number of difficult points that will go either to the High Court, or to the Privy Council. It will increase the work of the lawyers and the expenses of litigants, and create difficulties without improving the position at all. It is of no use to speak against the Bill, because the Government have made up their minds to force it through to-night. If they do, &#34;they must take the responsibility on their own shoulders, but I am satisfied that, &#34; before twelve or eighteen months are over their&#39; heads, curses loud and&#39; long will be uttered against them by the public, who will be the sufferers, for having introduced the Bill. </para>

            <para>. - It is a striking commentary upon parliamentary procedure in dealing with technical Bills, and also upon the peculiar attitude, taken up by the Government on this occasion, that such a speech as we have heard from the honorable member for Angas - a most carefully thought-out speech, full of erudition, that might well be carefully studied and thought over - has been delivered practically to empty benches. It is very unfortunate, and not encouraging to any of us who desire to aid the Government in arriving at a solution of the. very serious difficulty which faces us all in the working -out of the Constitution, that that should be so. </para>

              <para>- In that case, the position may be very similar to that created bv shutting the stable door after the horse has gone. I do not propose to. occupy much time, seeing that the Government has determined to force through the House, at this late hour, this extremely important measure, involving fundamental considerations in connexion with the whole constitutional fabric under which we live. In the circumstances, it would be perfectly useless for me, or any one else, to attempt to interest honorable members in a very technical discussion. I say at once that I deplore the fact that, under the Constitution, we have two Courts, whose decisions may, and do, come into conflict. Section 74 - the compromise which was ultimately effected in London - was, perhaps, the most unfortunate solution of the difficulty that could possibly have been arrived at. The fact that there is a conflict between the Privy Council and the High Court as to some of what we may call the primary principles underlying the Constitution, is a matter which ought to engage the most serious and earnest attention of the House. But are we likely now to have that attention, or to be able to deal with the question at all under this Bill ? The object of the Attorney-General in introducing the Bill is, I think, to meet the situation, but I believe that under it the difficulty will remain as great as it is at present. It will leave us with two tribunals each claiming to be the final arbiter in regard to a large portion of our constitutional law. It will leave our position absolutely uncertain. </para>

I have no doubt that the Attorney-General has devoted careful attention to the matter, but I would venture to remind him, without any breach of modesty, that it has been my fortune, or misfortune, to have been engaged recently in several cases to which the honorable member for Angas has referred, and that in connexion with those cases I, and others, had to go into this question quite as fully as he has done. Assuming that the Bill passes as it stands, it will still leave the conflict between the Privy Council and the High Court, as to what is the final law regarding these various constitutional points, in exactly the same position as at present. </para>

              <para>- this Bill does not in any way affect the authority or the standing of the Privy Council as the final and highest arbiter of our constitutional law.- It partially cuts off one channel through which certain classes of litigation may go to the Privy Council, but it does not do that in such definite or clear language that an ordinary lawyer is capable of determining to what extent it goes. Of all the difficult constitutional questions which can possibly be raised, the very meaning of this section 74 as to powers <inline font-style="italic">inter se</inline> is, perhaps,  the  most difficult. Let me give one or two. simple illustrations. As the honorable member for Angas has pointed out, a question as to the constitutional powers <inline font-style="italic">inter se</inline> of the States might or might not involve the construction or the interpretation to be put upon the Federal! Constitution. Such a question might arise in many cases which would not involve an interpretation of the Federal Constitution. Let us take a case of trespass on land within the disputed territory lying between Victoria and South Australia, and, by the way, I may say that the dispute in regard to that territory is now largely settled. Let us ass&#39;ume that a man commits a trespass, and that the person; aggrieved sues him for trespass in the Supreme Court. The defendant at once raises the reply, &#34; I only walked over your land.&#34; The rejoinder of the plaintiff is, &#34; But you did some damage.&#34; The issue is a very simple one. The defendant, however, says, &#34; This is a case which gives rise to a question as to the constitutional powers <inline font-style="italic">inter se</inline> of the States of South Australia and Victoria.&#34; The moment that defence is raised the Supreme Court has no jurisdiction. The plaintiff  might have brought his action in a County Court. That Court could deal effectively with the simple case, but the Supreme Court under this Bill would be effectually prevented from dealing with it. </para>

              <para>- Certainly. Let me show how it would arise. The man who trespassed would say to the plaintiff, &#34; You have no title to the land, and therefore you cannot complain that I have trespassed on it. Your title purports to have been granted by Victoria, whereas South Australia holds that she is the only State that can give a title to it.&#34; </para>

It is true that the man could be prosecuted in a police court, and could be convicted by that court, but if he applied, by the ordinary form of an order to review to the Supreme Court, the presiding Justice would say, &#34; Although the police court could deal with the case, I cannot.&#34; </para>

              <para>- I do not intend to occupy the attention of the House at length, because I recognise that it would be perfectly useless at this hour to attempt to seriously debate these extremely difficult questions, or to ask the attention of honorable members to them. We are really asked by the Government to do a little bit of not very effective tinkering with a &#39;very difficult subject. There is one way, and one way alone, in which we can properly tackle this great question. First of all, we have to look to the objects which we desire tq achieve. As far as I am concerned, I am entirely in accord with those who think that our High Court ought to have intrusted to it the final interpretation and construction of our Constitution. Not only am I entirely in accord with that view, but I am prepared to assist the Government in carrying it into effect. I believe that if a Federal Constitution like ours is to be worked out and developed so as to carry out the ideas in accordance with which it was instituted, that end can only be properly attained under a Court which is located in this country and familiar with our ways and with our laws. Starting from that ground, let us see whether this Bill carries us one step towards the ideal. First of all, what is the proper way in which we can attain what we desire? I will go further, and say this: I look forward to the time - it has not come yet, and may not come for a very long period- - when we may be able to trust the final determination of all legal questions to our own local Court. But I repeat that that time has not come vet. and it may not come for a long time, because of our relations in respect to commercial and other interests with the mother country. It may not be possible, for a long time, to deprive those persons who are interested in our affairs - prejudiced as they may be, but to whose good-will toward us and to whose capital we owe, and shall for a long time owe, a great deal of our commercial prosperity - of the right of appeal to the Privy Council. It might result in very serious loss to all classes of the community to do that. Therefore, I think that we must retain for a considerable time the right of appeal in ordinary matters of commercial and business law, arid of general law, to the one Court of Appeal for the whole of the British Dominions. But that is quite consistent with arranging that our own Court in Australia shall have the final say and the ultimate word, and shall be the final Court of Appeal, in regard to all questions involving the interpretation of our own Constitution. Those two principles being admitted - and I do not think that there- is any doubt about them - we come to inquire how are they to be carried into effect. Here we meet with serious difficulties. I say that there is one way of achieving our purpose, and one way only ; and that is the way that has been pointed out bv the honorable member&#39; for Angas and the honorable member for Balaclava, namely, by an amendment of the Constitution. That is the only possible way. </para>

              <para>- This Bill does not help us a bit in that direction. The effect it will have is this : First of all, it will say with regard to one of our Courts - namely, the Supreme Court - that when a certain class of questions of a character highly difficult to define, arise in that Court, its jurisdiction has been ousted. Those questions are as to the rights <inline font-style="italic">inter se</inline> of the Commonwealth and of the States. Now, suppose the defendant in any case in the Supreme Court desires to raise an issue simply for the purpose of causing delay - a kind of thing that is frequently done. It is not always the lawyers who are to blame for that. It is frequently their clients who desire that difficulties shall be raised, and the lawyers cannot be blamed for giving effect to their wishes if the law allows it. </para>

              <para>- The lawyer is not set up as a judge of morals.- He is there to do what his duty requires him to do, namely, his best for his client under the existing law. No one can blame him for doing it. What I say is that if this Bill passes, there are hundreds of such instances which might be cited. I myself could give numberless instances in which in all kinds of actions the validity of any State Act,&#34; no matter what it may be, may be called in question, because it can be said that it is in conflict with some provision of the Constitution. And that may apply to almost every action in which the question of the power of a State Parliament to pass a particular Act can be raised. It may very well be said, &#34; Oh, but the objection is not <inline font-style="italic">bond fide.&#34;</inline> Who is to determine under this measure whether it is <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> or not? As soon as the issue is raised - no matter for what purpose it is raised - the Court cannot inquire what the purpose is. The Court cannot inquire whether it is honestly raised or not. As soon as the issue is raised, ihe Supreme Court is deprived of all jurisdiction. Now, I saywithout the slightest hesitation that that will lead to two things. In the first place, it will lead to placing in the hands of unscrupulous lawyers and unscrupulous clients, a weapon which they will use to the very widest extent, and to the fullest purpose, in order to delay the ends of justice. It will do that undoubtedly. Another thing it will do is to throw upon the original jurisdiction of the High Court such a volume of litigation as will inevitably necessitate a large number of new appointments to the Bench. Those are the two consequences which will arise from this Bill. And while it will do these two things;  it will not achieve the purpose which the Attorney-General has in his mind. </para>

              <para>- Any number of them. A very large percentage of the cases that at present come before the Supreme Courts will be dealt with in that way. This measure will be used as an instrument, and a very efficient instrument, for creating delay and causing confusion. I know that it is the fashion to sneer at lawyers and their ways, but I can say, without the slightest hesitation, that as far as lawyers are concerned, this is just the sort of Bill that they want. </para>

              <para>- Yes. For my own part, I feel that it would be quite useless for me to attempt to give ,to the House any fair idea of my own views upon this Bill, except in the barest outline Which I have already given. Since the Government are determined to push this measure through, I think that, perhaps, we shall be best serving the interests of the country by allowing them to take the whole of the responsibility attaching to it. I can only voice very briefly the warning which I, as a lawyer, feel should be uttered regarding the difficulties of the situation. But I think that, perhaps, the best thing we can do under the circumstances, is to abstain from attempting to discuss the Bill. The Government have introduced it, and they must take full responsibility for it. Perhaps we shall best consult not only our own interests, but those of our constituents, by getting, not only this Bill, but the other measure&#39;s which the Government are determined to interpose in the Tariff discussion out of the way as soon as possible. </para>

              <para>- In view of the statement of the Acting Prime Minister, 1 wish to say that, although three speeches upon the Bill have been delivered by honorable members upon this side of the House, no honorable member upon the opposite side has deemed it necessary to say a word. The speeches which have been &#39; made have merely touched the fringe of the subject, but they have been sufficient to show the grave and far-reaching character of the measure now under consideration. I think it is most unreasonable to begin to apply methods of brute force to a Judiciary Bill. I shall not be a party to the application of such methods to measures of far-reaching importance and of a nonparty character. We should address ourselves to their consideration when our faculties are most alert - not when members are in the tired and jaded condition in which they are now. For these reasons I shall decline to discuss the Bill at all. T shall do - as the honorable member for Flinders has suggested - throw the entire  responsibility upon the Government, and allow them to take their own course. </para>

            <para>.- I regret exceedingly the tone of extreme petulance exhibited by the last two speakers. It seems to me particularly childish that they should complain that &#34;the numbers are up,&#34; seeing that the action of the Government is the result  of  an attempt by the Opposition to use their numbers in an extremely improper manner. To my mind, this Bill represents an attempt to restore to the Australian people certain rights of which they were deprived by the action of the Imperial Parliament in inserting certain amendments in the Commonwealth Constitution Bill. There  is no doubt that the people were under the impression that that measure limited very largely the right of appeal to the Privy Council. I am very glad that it is proposed to confirm the High Court in its position as the final arbiter upon questions involving the interpretation of our Constitution. The honorable member for Flinders quoted two cases in this connexion. He cited the case of a man who brought an action for trespass in the &#34; no man&#39;s land &#34; lying between Victoria and South Australia. He instanced that as a case in which the individual might no longer have his remedy in the Supreme Court, but in the County Court. Personally, I do not think he would have any remedy in the County Court. The honorable member further cited the case of a man who had certain Customs rights which had been infringed. These very cases, it seems to me, should be decided, not by a State Court, but by the High Court. I want to know what provision is made in this -Bill for a poor man who Kas rights similar to those which may arise in the case of the disputed territory between Victoria and South Australia. The Supreme Court of the State could not act. Unfortunately, the County Court could not act, because the jurisdiction of the County Court of Victoria is limited to the State, and the Police Court could not act. The consequence would be that in a small dispute a man would have to avail himself of the original jurisdiction of the High Court. I wish to know if the AttorneyGeneral proposes that in a small case there should be only the High Court open to a litigant? </para>

              <para>- The defendant in a certain case might raise the question that the authority relied on was outside the jurisdiction of the County Court of Victoria, and consequently a man who previously had a right to take a small case to the Supreme Court would have only the High Court to go to, and might have to wait for months before his case could be dealt with. These are practical difficulties in the way. In the splendid and exhaustive&#39; speech of the honorable and learned member for Angas, for which I feel the &#39; House must be grateful, we had the admission that even the honorable member, looking at the Bill from a strictly critical stand-point, be,lieves that we can proceed in this way . under the Constitution, although he would , prefer that we should adopt the procedure of an amendment of the Constitution or an Order in Council by the Privy Council. I am very glad to be able to say that if the Prime Minister at the Imperial Conference took one stand &#39; - more firmly, than another it was that we want no outside interference with our Australian Constitution. If possible, we wish to work out our own constitutional reform by ourselves. I would far rather adopt the cumbrous method provided for amending the Constitution to making   an appeal to the Imperial Parliament or any outside authority to define our powers in any way. I should not approve of the procedure of an appeal for an Order of the Privy Council ; to amend the Constitution would be to adopt a cumbrous procedure, to which effect could not be given for three years, and consequently I feel that we should adopt the course now proposed, and which the honorable and learned member for Angas admits is a constitutional procedure. It is, at all event&#39;s, in accord with the views of the Australian people, and I am therefore glad that the matter can be settled in the way proposed, and that this measure has been brought forward promptly. </para>

              <para>- Well, I hope that the Committee apprehends what is being done. It only shows what this piecemeal legislation amounts to. Under this Bill, while we have absolutely emasculated the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Courts of Victoria, South Australia, and New South Wales, the District Courts, in important <inline font-style="italic">inter se</inline> matters, the County Courts, and the Police Courts, can still entertain these questions; and an appeal may go from them to the Privy Council by leave. I may tell honorable members that this was one of my reasons for quoting the Act 7 and 8 Victoria, ch. 69, which was deliberately passed to give the right of appeal from these subordinate Courts over the Supreme Court of the State direct to the Privy Council. Such appeals are frequently entertained. </para>

The Supreme Courts have, been denuded of jurisdiction. The result under this Bill will be that, if in a case before any of these inferiorCourts, the litigant wishes to go to the Privy Council, the Privy Council will entertain his appeal. The rule in Canada and the rule laid down in Australia in <inline font-style="italic">Prince</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Gagnon,</inline> is that where the litigant does not go in the first instance to the Court of Appeal, which is our High Court, or in the case of the States to the State Supreme &#39;Courts, the Pa-ivy Council will &#39; entertain- an appeal, not merely in important matters, but in ordinary matters. </para>

            <para>.- I desire to refer to the recent case of <inline font-style="italic">Robinson .</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Webb,</inline> in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Arthur</inline> Robinson applied to the Privy Council for leave to appeal thereto. It was a reserved case to the case of <inline font-style="italic">Outtrim</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Webb.</inline> He was appealing against the taxation of his parliamentary allowance under the Income Tax Act of Victoria. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Isaacs,</inline> who was then at the bar, advised him that he had an absolute right to appeal from the Court of Petty Sessions to the Privy Council, because, at that time, that Court was-, by Victorian legislation, made the final Court of Appeal in income tax cases. The Privy Council always takes up the position that if a person cannot get redress from the courts of his country he has the right to apply to it for leave to appeal. Seeing that under Victorian law he could get no further redress in Victoria, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Arthur</inline> Robinson had the right to ask the Privy Council, as a matter of grace, to allow him to appeal thereto. I think that the honorable member for Angas is quite right. In closing one avenue to the Privy Council, we do not wish to leave the way open to a person to appeal, not from the Supreme Court of a State, but from its most inferior Court. </para>

          <para class="block">The point I had in view in circulating the amendment was whether we ought to deny the right which now exists to cases such as that initiated by the Government of New South Wales within the last few weeks or so. I do not think that any legislation ought to be made practically retrospective. This Bill is not quite retrospective in the ordinary sense. If is not applied to cancel rights which have been granted prior to its introduction, but it certainly does take away from a litigant the right of going to the Privy Council which he had when heinstituted proceedings. New South Wales had, I think, begun proceedings, and the&#34; Commonwealth had taken proceedings against that State before the Bill was introduced. I think the State authorities are under the impression that as the proceedings had been begun an appeal may go to the Privy Council. I am not prepared to say at the present time that they can get to the Privy Council, because I do not know exactly what has been done. If they have gone to the State Court I do not think it is likely that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers</inline> will get to the Privy Council, because he would obtain a decision in his favour, and it would then be for the other party to say whether he should go.

            <para>. - I acknowledge that the honorable member for Angas has directed only the fairest criticisms against the Bill. As regards some of his criticisms, I was inclined to agree with him. Had it not been for the pressure which is put upon us by the necessity to deal with the Tariff, I would have assisted him in closing some of the loopholes which the Bill appears to me to allow to remain open. But, as regards his amendment, I regret that I cannot see eye to eye with him. In the first place, as he admits, it is rather improbable that one large case that is pending is likely to reach the Privy Council. It is the right of the loser to select the tribunal to which he will appeal, as a Court of final jurisdiction from a judgment of the Supreme Court. Therefore, it does not seem to me that there is much probability of an appeal to the Privy Council taking place. Leaving aside such cases, I do not see what real injury can be done to any litigant by the action which we are taking. I am inclined to believe that the interests of litigants will be better served by limiting the number of Courts to which an appeal can be made. Early finality is desirable in their interests, even in cases where abstract justice is not always administered. If we can reduce the number of Courts to which litigants can go, it would be a gain. But I do not think that there can be any two opinions as to the desirability of having only one interpreter of the Constitution. What injury can result to any State or party interested in a constitutional case by our limiting the right of appeal to the High Court? Surely we have confidence in the constitutional knowledge of the Court which we have created, and its desire to interpret the Constitution in a fair spirit, as between litigants I .Although I do not agree with some of its decisions, still, I recognise that it has been actuated by the highest motives, and by an earnest anxiety to hold the balance evenly between the Commonwealth and the States, and to&#39; interpret the Constitution in the spirit of legal maxims and understandings. That, coupled with the high ability of the . Judges, should, I think, inspire -us with confidence that the Court will see that no harm shall accrue to any litigant. While I agree with the honorable member that in ordinary cases retrospective legislation is undesirable, I do not think that we can do any harm in this particular instance, even though the measure may involve actions already pending. </para>

            <para>. - I -would point out to the Committee that the Bill was not in- .troduced because the Government had in view any particular case, and, as for cases instituted since its introduction, thev were commenced with the knowledge that it was before Parliament, and that the Government intended .to pass it. Whether it will affect any case will depend upon the defences and pleadings which are raised, and I am not prepared to express a dogmatic opinion on the point. The Bill has been introduced to put an end to conflicts of interpretation in regard to the fundamental principles of the Constitution. One such conflict of a serious nature has already arisen, and we do not wish for others, because they are most disturbing factors, and the Constitution deals, not with trivial but with important matters, affecting the welfare of the Commonwealth and the States, and their harmonious relations. What is desired is to have one final Court of Appeal. </para>

            <para>.- I regard the proposal of the honorable member for Angas as- fair and reasonable, and  1  should like to see it passed in the interests of fair play. Last vear. I had to give advice in an income-tax case, and if the Premier of Victoria had had the power to force me to the Privy Council, and had exercised it, T should have considered that I was being very unfairly treated. I am sorry that the case of the Premier of New South Wales has been brought into the dis cussion; but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers,</inline> and any other man who has already commenced ah action, will have a real grievance if we do anything to interfere with or prejudice any right which he had at the time of its commencement. It may be true that in-&#39; tending litigants knew that the Bill had been introduced, but no one can say in advance that a Bill will pass. Those who have already commenced actions should be allowed to retain the privileges which the existing law gives to them, among which is the right to appeal to either the High Court or the Privy Council. We shall .do an injustice to litigants and to ourselves if we took away that right. </para>
