                        <para>No such list is in use bv the Customs officers or known to the Department. The so-called Tariff Guide which was issued under the old Tariff was merely an indication that as regards any articles mentioned therein certain duty would be charged by the Customs. Thai Guide if circulated now would be misleading to a certain extent inasmuch as the grouping of articles is not the same under the present Tariff as in the former one. Copies, however, of the old Guide have been placed in the Library, &#38;c, and any member desiring it will be supplied with a copy. </para>

                            <para>A circular wire was sent in August to all official Postmasters and Postal Inspectors, asking them for a return of overtime worked during June, July, and August. No request was made in such wire for a return as to offices undermanned, but in March last the then Acting Senior Inspector, in order to ascertain what additional staff should be provided on the draft Estimates then under preparation, asked Postmasters in the Metropolitan district whether their staffs were inadequate, and if so to state what additional staff would be required and the reasons therefor, having due regard to economy. Following upon a special report by the accountant as to the excessive rate of expenditure on the vote for temporary assistance, the postmasters were informed, on the 21st instant, that the expenditure on the item was far too large, and that special endeavours must at once be made to reduce it, and they were requested to take action to curtail such expenditure and informed that they would be held personally responsible for any <inline font-style="italic">unnecessary</inline> temporary assistance found to be or to have been engaged at their offices. District inspectors were informed on the19th idem of the position of the Temporary Assistance Vote, and instructed that when visiting offices, or at any other opportunity, they are to inquire closely into the question generally of &#34; Temporary Assistance &#34; employed at offices in their districts, and if any unnecessary use is found to be or to have been made of such assistance to report such with any recommendation in regard thereto. </para>

The information was utilized to decide what additional staff should be provided on the draft. Estimates then being prepared. No doubt, the Country Inspectors asked for somewhat similar information in connexion with the reports they had to furnish as to staff required to be provided on draft Estimates then in course of preparation. </para>

                        <para>. - I am very pleased indeed that we have reached the stage when we can consider the Tariff in detail, but I hope that you, sir, will extend to me a little latitude on this occasion, as I desire to refer to two or three matters which are connected with the general question. In reply to the many statements which have been made as to the long time which has been occupied in arriving at this item, I would point out that, so far as one can judge, there has not been inordinate delay. If, however, there has been any delay, I think that the honorable member for Hunter, who is smiling at my remark, has contributed his share towards it. On the 8th August, the Tariff was laid on the Table, and the Budget delivered. The debate was postponed at the request of honorable members opposite until the 21st August, when it was resumed, and it ended on the 13th September. Honorable members can easily compute how long the debate lasted. It. covered not only the Tariff, but also the Budget. I have not complained, nor do I complain now, of the fact that it extended to a period of three weeks. The  deputy  leader of the Opposition desired to have a separate debate on the Tariff, as well. as a debate on the Budget; but, in order to conserve time, rather than for any other purpose, I asked the Committee to be content with one debate. I venture to say that, had there been two debates, the discussion, instead of occupying about three weeks, would have occupied almost twice that time. </para>

                            <para>- I do not intend to speak at length. I desire to point out to the Committee, and especially to the public, some of whom have complained of what they call the undue delay which has taken place, that really there has not been very much delay. In introducing the Budget, I said that when the debate on my speech had terminated, I would introduce the Works Estimates. Honorable members know that if the Works Estimates had not been introduced and passed before the completion of the Tariff, all the works and buildings of the Commonwealth would have been suspended. That I think is a very good answer to those who seem to think that there has been undue delay. From the very first I said that there were certain measures which the Government intended to take prior to the consideration of the Tariff. I venture to think that the consideration of those measures which have passed through the Chamber did not occupy much time. The debate on the Works Estimates commenced on the 14th and terminated on the 25th September, so that it cannot be said that in that regard there has been undue delay. We have now arrived at the stage when we can consider the Tariff in detail. As I have said more than once when acting for the Prime Minister, unless some event of very great importance occurs, there will be no interference with the consideration of the Tariff until such time as it may be completed. Of course, if any matter should crop up suddenly, or if some measure in reference to the amendment of anti-trust legislation, such as the one to which the Prime Minister has referred to-day, and which I think is one of considerable urgency, should be required, it may be necessary to ask honorable members to deal at once with that business. But, with that exception, I trust that the idea which the Government has entertained from the start will &#39;be carried out, and that the Tariff will be considered with the greatest expedition. There is no doubt that after the introduction of any Tariff there is an unrest amongst the commercial community, and undue charges are made to all classes of purchasers. That is one of the reasons - the chief reason I may say- why it is necessary to act with expedition. I have no doubt that the distributors have availed themselves of their opportunity to a great extent, though, I hope I may be permitted to show shortly that the general statements regarding extra charges to the community are not borne out by the inquiries which I have had made. I shall instance a few examples presently. </para>

                            <para>- In view of the fact that a duty has been imposed on tinned kerosene only, it is an unfair charge. The object of that duty is to insure that the oil shall be tinned in the Commonwealth. The bulk oil is allowed to come in free, and therefore the increased price on the tinned oil up to the present time is unfair to the community. I&#34; think I may say that all or nearly all the oil which has been sold since the introduction of the Tariff has not paid duty. </para>

                            <para>- I have no doubt of that. I hope we shall very shortly reach the consideration of the item of tobacco, seeing that it is second on the list, after spirits ; and I hope that we shall deal with it in such a way as to prevent the imposition of any&#39; further extra charge on the community. While the public may have suffered in some directions, the time has now arrived when they are to receive consideration, and when any undue extra charge, which may have been made since the imposition of the Tariff, will be stopped. I do not desire to deal with individual items - I do not think it wise to do so - though there are some which stand out rather prominently, and will doubtless require amendment. Anomalies will occur in every Tariff. For instance, chairs have been mentioned as one item out of a large number, and then there is wire netting, together with a variety of other items. But the Government must conduct their business in regard to the Tariff in a certain way, which, I hope, will recommend itself to the Committee. We cannot afford to jump from one item to another, with a view of selecting any particular commodity for special treatment, because, if that were done, there would be great complaints from those interested in other items not so favorably considered. It is the desire of the Government, therefore, to, as far as possible, deal with the items in the order in which they are presented. The Tariff Commission sat a long time and did much arduous work. </para>

The members of that Commission devoted themselves assiduously to their work; but I do not care how earnestly or faithfully a Commission of this kind perform their duties, it is utterly impossible for them to formulate a Tariff which will absolutely meet the wishes of the Government or of Parliament. The Tariff Commission, who were appointed at the instance of the leader of &#39;the Opposition, was not given power to formulate a Tariff. </para>

                            <para>- In the mind of the leader of the Opposition, who was then Prime Minister, and in the minds of most others concerned, the duty of the Commission was to investigate and ascertain anomalies in the Tariff - to find where the Tariff was weak, in so far as it was not high enough or low enough, and then report&#39; through the proper channel, leaving it to the .Government, as representing the Commonwealth and this Parliament, to submit to the House what they conceive to be a proper Tariff. That has been done. I repeat that it is quite a mistake to imagine that the Commission were asked to frame a Tariff though they did partially frame or attempted to partially frame one. </para>

                            <para>- Well, we shall call them suggestions, though I have never heard that view put before by- any member of the Tariff Commission. I take it that it was the duty of the Government to accept as many suggestions as they deemed advisable, and then, if they desired, to vary or alter the suggested duties, that was their responsibility. In one or two cases, the Commission recommended preference, but not to the extent the Government desired j arid, therefore, the Government have extended the preference as shown in the Tariff submitted to honorable members. In recognising the time and thought devoted by the Tariff Commission to their duties, I am not referring particularly to one section or other of the Commission ; T give both sections A and B every credit for doing what they thought to .be right. But the duty of the Government was to consider the recommendations of the Commission, and to submit such a Tariff as they thought the circumstances demanded. I have a document in my hand which shows that the recommendations df section A of the Tariff Commission have been followed by the Government in  329  cases. I regard that as a very large proportion, in view of the considerations which occurred to me in looking through the reports. I have, as far as I reasonably could, examined the reports, and I have certainly examined the recommendations ; and it appears to me that sometimes the evidence on which recommendations were made was rather meagre. In some cases, only one or two witnesses were examined, and it was quite impossible for the Commission to obtain all the evidence they desired on which to base their recommendations. They had to accept such witnesses as came before them. </para>

I have picked out a few items in order to direct the attention of the Committee to our position in regard to these matters. The quantity of manufactured tobacco we annually import amounts to 1,926,002 lbs., and of unmanufactured tobacco to 7,538,241 lbs. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, but the industry is a struggling industry at the present time. When I was in Mildura, some time ago, I was told that unless the industry were given some assistance, the growers there would have to cease producing currants. It is not the same with raisins. I suppose that we can produce hops in the Commonwealth as well as they can be produced anywhere in the world, and yet we have an annual importation amounting to 1,412,569 lbs. of hops; of malt, we import 68,973 centals ; and of soap, 2,038,603 lbs. We also import apparel and attire to the value of . &#163;1,636,764 ; piece-goods, woollen, or containing wool, to the value of &#163;1,993,312, and iron, corrugated and galvanized. 1,245,211 cwt. </para>

Those who know something of Melbourne will be aware that the people who own the largest mansions and live in the best style in this city are importers who add nothing to the wealth of the country&#39;. They import goods at a certain rate, and, adding from 25 per cent, to 40 per cent, to their cost price, impose that as a burden on the shoulders of the people. </para>

The importers, with their rings, were charging <inline font-style="italic">6\6.</inline> to 7jd. per lb. to the coal miners for the best class of candle. I think that the duty imposed was 3d. per lb., and within twelve months from its imposition the competition of Australian manufacturers with the importers brought the price of candles down to 4jd. per lb. </para>

                            <para>- I intend to do so ; but surely I am entitled to make a few prefatory remarks. There are in the Tariff a number of anomalies with which we shall deal when we reach the items to which they relate. But as one who has been a protectionist throughout his political life I do not intend to speak of protection with bated breath. I am not going to talk of a so-called protection which means no protection at all. When we have such an opportunity as now presents itself to deal with the fiscal policy I think that we should speak our minds in regard to it, and that we should frame a Tariff which will represent not a half-and-half class of protection such as we have had, but genuine sturdy protection. That is the object I have in view, and I shall do all that I can to secure a Tariff that will afford protection to our industries. I do not intend to favour a mere revenue Tariff, and I trust that those who have been returned to this House as protectionists will not be satisfied with such a Tariff. Let them now declare themselves; let them say at once that they are either protectionists or freetraders, and not be prepared as protectionists to drag down the scale of duties to a point at which we should have a mere revenue Tariff which is only incidentally protective. I do not wish our young and true Australians to remain as in the past in the employ of importers and indent agents with their feet under the legs of the foreigner&#39;s table.I wish to see our young men and pur young women in a position to earn their own livings, and to see the number of our unemployed largely reduced. The woman who, having a family of boys and girls, is prepared to let them cling to the money of the importers rather than to make an effort to increase the field of labour in Australia is not a true mother, and the man or woman who is prepared to rest content under the old order of things is not a true Australian. </para>

                            <para>- In this House as well as in the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales I have often seen the right honorable member at the pump and trying to work up a fury. I never attempt anything of the kind ; all that I endeavour to do is to put the clear, bare facts before the House. I said just now, in reply to the honorable member for North Sydney, that I should place before honorable members a comparison of the present Commonwealth Tariff with the old one, as well as with those of other countries. Under . the heading of &#34; Total Imports, excluding coin and bullion,&#34; I find that the percentages of Customs duty collected to values of goods imported into the Commonwealth, Victoria, and other countries, was. as follows : - The old Federal Tariff, 1906, 17.15; the new Tariff, 21; Victorian Tariff, 12.6; Canadian Tariff, 16.25; New Zealand Tariff, 18.55; and the United States Tariff of 1904-5, 23.12. </para>

                            <para>- I have not, but I daresay I shall be able to get the information. . Quite a different result is arrived at if one takes only the principal protected items. So far as I can gather, the average rate of duty under the old Tariff was 19.5 per cent., and in the present Tariff is 30.8 per cent., on the protected items in the foreign or general list, showing an increase of over 10 per cent. in the average. I desire honorable members to understand that I have given these figures to show what the total amount of taxation comes to, and to prove that this is a protective Tariff, whilst the other was not. </para>

                            <para>- No, but I did work out some of them, and had them corrected. In answer to the honorable member  for North Sydney, I wish to say that I sent an officer to Prahran, one of the principal suburbs of Melbourne; to ascertain from some of the principal stores and shops the prices before and after the Tariff. I took this action in order to provide an answer to those who say that people who deal with reputable houses are being fleeced. If people are being made to pay more, the list that I am about to read is a very great stigma on the smaller shopkeepers. Four or five reputable houses in Prahran were selected. I think that honorable members will agree that that is a suburb from which a very fair, estimate of prices can be obtained. I asked the officer to obtain so far as he could those articles which are used in the ordinary home. </para>

I have heard a great many people say that the price of washing blue has been very greatly increased. The facts given here are that the price of laundry blue before the Tariff was 7d. per lb., and the price since the. Tariff is 7d. per lb. The increase is <inline font-style="italic">nil,</inline> and there is an increased duty of1d. per lb. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that in the ordinary home gloves are taken home to fry for supper. I want these figures to be well known to the public in order that they may see that if there have been extra charges, they are not made by  reputable houses. Candles, Electrine, price before the Tariff, 61/2d., price since the Tariff, 7d. The increase is1/2d. per lb. That is the increase in the duty, and no more. A good many people have told me that there has been an immense increase in the price of candles. If that is so, it must have been charged by the smaller distributing shopkeepers. Liquorice in sticks, price before the Tariff,11/2d. an ounce; since the Tariff,11/2d. an ounce. The increase of duty is11/2d. per lb., and yet there has been no increase in the price. In the case of currants, which are to be found in nearly every small home, the price before the Tariff was 61/2d. per lb., and the price since is 7d. The increase in price is1/2d., and the increase of duty is1d.per lb. There has been no undue increase in price in that case. </para>

Dried herbs were1d. a packet before the Tariff, and are1d. a packet now. The increase of duty is  4d.  a lb. In the case of honey and jams, which are very largely used, there has been no increase, although the extra duty is1/2d. per lb. I am one of those who think that honey and jam should be produced here in much larger quantities, and very little imported. In the case of safety matches, the price was  2d.  a packet before the Tariff, and is 31/2d. now, or an increase of11/2d. a packet. The increase of duty is1s. per gross of boxes, and upwards. I am sorry that I have not got quotations for matches other than safety matches, because I understand that in some places persons are charged1d. a box extra compared with what they were charged before the Tariff. I wanted to find out if that was true. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot tell the honorable member. I have merely given the information in my possession, and I contend that it supplies an answer to a&#34; good many of the statements which have been made regarding increases in the prices of goods. I may tell honorable members that, in 1901, I obtained a more extended list than that from which I have quoted of the prices of commodities a week before and a week after the introduction of the Kingston Tariff. I obtained still another list six months later. What did I find ? A week after the Tariff had been submitted the distributors, taking advantage of their position, had increased the prices of their goods,insome cases, very materially. But in all instances in which the Tariff operated, as an incentive to production, the prices of those goods six months later were less than those charged a week prior to that Tariff being introduced. </para>

                            <para>- Upon articles, such as fruits and jams, I do not care how high the duties may be, because I maintain that we ought to produce them here. When I say that upon articles which we desire to protect the new Tariff is about 10 or 11 per cent. higher than the1901 -2 Tariff, I am speaking of commodities which we can manufacture and produce in Australia. The result will be a great impetus to the production and manufacture of these goods, which we should have made long ago. I come now to the question upon which I propose to make an important statement. When we introduced the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Bill some persons were of opinion that the Government were going to cause manufacturers a great deal of trouble, even if we did not ruin them. </para>

I do not intend to read a letter that I have in my possession which is to the effect that, in connexion with that Act, a large firm has been called upon to produce its books, and has declined to do so. Provision will be made in the Bill to which the Prime Minister referred to-day - it is only a short measure - to prevent manufacturers withholding their books, and authority will be given to examine those books anywhere. The Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act, which was passed last year, dealt only with a limited number of subjects. That measure represented the commencement of legislation upon the lines of what is known as the new protection. . It is only by experience that we find out the weak  points in legislation.

                            <para>- We have not amended them yet, but they will be amended. The proposals which the Government intend to submit, and which I hope constitute a considerable improvement upon the existing state of things, I intend to explain to the Committee presently. But before I do that I wish to emphasize the fact that, had the Excise Act which was passed in connexion with harvester machinery last year worked out properly, it would not have been injurious to the general public, but would have conduced to the well-being of all. No one would have been ruined or injured by it, but a&#39; standard wage to the employes would have been kept up. When we are proposing a Tariff which is intended to protect  manufacturers, to give increased employment to our people, and to strengthen and build up the Australian sentiment, we must not forget the motive power of all our industries, viz., the working man. </para>

                            <para>- I would go in for it to-day if it were necessary. If we are going to have protection for the manufacturers and protection for the producers, we must have a system of protection for the labouring classes. As I have pointed out, it has been very difficult to institute a system of that &#39;kind which shall not be too cumbersome. We have aimed, in the proposals I am about to submit, at devising a system which will be effective; and which, at the same time is the least cumbersome system we have been able to discover. The method by which it is. proposed to secure that manufacturers whose manufactures are protected by the new Tariff, shall only enjoy that advantage on condition that they pay a fair rate of wages, is, in outline, as follows :  - (1) An Excise duty at the rate of half the duty imposed by the Tariff on imported goods of the same class, to be imposed on all goods manufactured in Australia. (2) An exemption to be made as to all goods which are manufactured under conditions as to remuneration of labour which are fair and reasonable. As this scheme involves the imposition of taxation, it can be more conveniently carried out by two Acts, one simply imposing the duties and giving effect to  the exemptions, and the other providing the necessary machinery. This course is rendered necessary by section 5.5 of the Constitution, which provides that - </para>

                            <para>- Yes. Obviously the chief difficulty in this scheme is to determine what are fair conditions as to remuneration of labour. Some general standard of fairness is &#34;required. It is proposed to adopt, with certain alterations, that standard which now enables a manufacturer to have the Commonwealth trade mark applied to his goods. Thus goods to which the Commonwealth trade mark is applied will be exempt from the new Excise duties. </para>

At the present time the Commonwealth trade mark can be applied only with the authority of the Minister, to goods which have been manufactured under conditions as to remuneration of labour which either have been declared to be fair, and reasonable by resolutions of both Houses of the Parliament, or are in accordance with the award of a Commonwealth or State industrial tribunal or of a Wages Board, or are in accordance with an industrial agreement. So that at the present time, apart from the resolutions of both Houses, a manufacturer can obtain the right to use the Commonwealth trade mark only if he is working under an industrial award or agreement. It. is proposed to bring into existence a new tribunal to be called the Board of Excise. </para>

                            <para>- All these are matters of detail, and I am giving merely an outline of what is proposed. The powers of the Board would be exercisable by one or more members. The Board is to have power to refer any question to a State industrial authority, which means an Industrial Arbitration Court or Wages Board, or to a police or stipendiary or special magistrate, who will have power to call in assessors representing each side. This authority will report to the Board, and the Board may act on its report. The reason for this provision is that cases for investigation may arise in small country towns, to reach which the Board might have to spend a great deal of time in travelling, and it is proposed that if there is a suitable person, such as a police magistrate, he may be given the work of gathering evidence, with the assistance of two experts. That evidence will be sent to the Board to be dealt with, and if it is not considered satisfactory, the Board may cancel it, and take evidence itself. The Board will have power to enter and to inspect factories, to summon witnesses, to take evidence on oath, and to require the production of books, and witnesses giving evidence before it will be adequately protected. </para>

The Excise duty will be levied in this way : If a Commonwealth trade mark is not placed on manufactures, the manufacturer will have to purchase from the Government an Excise stamp equivalent to one-half the duty, which he must pay for not complying with conditions, compliance with which would exempt him from the payment of Excise. </para>

The second proposal is to give to officers of Customs and Excise full power of inspection of all factories and access to books, documents, wage-sheets, &#38;c, although, of course, no publicity will be given to confidential information. </para>

                            <para>- These proposals are intended to protect the workers in protected industries. But with a view of protecting the consumer from extortion it is proposed to invest the Board of Excise with further powers. The Board may possibly become an Inter- State Commission. The reason why I do not propose the creation of an Inter-State Commission now is because the Government want this policy to be brought into force soon, and it might  take a considerable time to pass an InterState Commission Bill. I have made two efforts in that direction, and I believe that the time has arrived when the House will pass a measure. If the Board is composed of suitable men they can be appointed as an Inter-State Commission. </para>

                            <para>- I am very pleased to hear that statement. Before conferring on the Board of Excise the functions especially associated with the InterState Commission, it is proposed to intrust it with the duty of inquiring into and reporting to Parliament on the general conditions surrounding production and trade, and particularly on prices or combinations to raise prices. If, on inquiry, the Board find that prices are unduly high, or that combinations to raise prices in protected trades exist, they will have power to recommend to Parliament that the duty shall be lowered or abolished. </para>

                            <para>- The Bill which will be originated in the Senate to-morrow, will do away with the trouble in connexion with getting information. That is an outline of the proposals which, as I stated at the commencement of my speech, will necessitate the amendment of two&#34; Acts of Parliament. I think that when honorable members thoroughly understand the scheme they will see that it is no. make believe, that it will have the effect which I believe is desired by nearly all the members of the Committee, and by the people of this community, and that is  to, see  that whilst we give protection to the manufacturers and increase their production, the workers will not be left out in the cold, but will get their share of that protection. Before I resume my seat, I desire to quote a few figures with reference to the Customs and Excise revenue collected in each State during September of this year and last year, and also during the quarter ending 30th September in those years. In New South Wales, the revenue has increased for the month from &#163;281,314 to &#163;377,184; and for the quarter from &#163;964,674 to &#163;1,215,982. In Victoria, the revenue has increased for the month from &#163;211,211 to &#163;2(18,938, and for the quarter- from &#163;885,802 to &#163;1,024,177. In Queensland, the revenue has increased for the month from &#163;77,727 to &#163;85,800. and for the quarter from ,&#163;262,430 to &#163;285,468. In South Australia the &#34; revenue Has increased for the month from &#163;47,847 to &#163;80,696, and for the quarter from &#163;178,852 to .&#163;236,522. In Western Australia the revenue has decreased for the month from &#163;61,957 to &#163;58,637, and for the quarter from &#163;219,800 to &#163;202,803. In Tasmania the revenue has increased for the month from .&#163;18,929 to .&#163;21,023, and for the quarter from &#163;52,610 to .&#163;5.7,768. The total increase for the month has been from &#163;698,985 to &#163;892,287, and for the quarter from &#163;2,564,168 to &#163;3,022,720.

                        <para>.- The figures that the Treasurer has just given are, I think, a very much more important fact in connexion with the Tariff than are price lists from one or two shops in Prahran. According to the lists  from one or two shops &#34;there, the effect of the Tariff is scarcely worthy of any serious consideration. According to the figures which the Treasurer has just given, there was for the one month of September, an increase, as compared with September of last year, in four States only, of  ,&#163;250,000,  or at the rate of  000, 000  on the twelve months. I am, of course, giving the round figures, and not the exact amounts. But the position as disclosed by the Minister&#39;s own figures is astonishing. In New South Wales the increase was  ,&#163;90,000  for the month, or at the rate of  &#163;1,100,000  for the year, while in Victoria the increase for the month was  ,&#163;50,000,  or at the rate of  &#163;600,000  a year. In Queensland the increase was slight, being only at the rate of  &#163;100,000  a year, but in South Australia, which has generally been rather slow in its figures, the increase was at the rate of  &#163;400,000  a year. </para>

                            <para>- As I had to immediately follow the Treasurer, I had not time to make both calculations, and I selected the figures for the month as being the more significant, seeing that they represent a  period when the rush, which took place in consequence of the Tariff, was practically over. There are no speculative imports now. As we know, the bonded warehouses&#39; are gorged with goods which would have come into the ordinary markets of commerce, but for the fact that merchants are hanging on to the bonded stocks until they know what the Tariff is to be. If reductions in the duties are made, importers do not get the benefit of those reductions, once the goods are out of bond. Although ordinary commerce is paralyzed except in so far as the absolute necessities of the people of Australia are concerned, the figures show the enormous burden not in theory - not in argument of a fiscal character - but the enormous burden which is represented by  3,000,000  sovereigns a year - taken out of the pockets of the people in the four States of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, and. South Australia. I do not desire to enter at any length into this fiscal question. The Treasurer, was. I think, perfectly justified in taking this opportunity to deliver the address to which we have just listened ; but, as I say, I shall not take up the time of the Committee at any length, even on such vastly important subjects, because I feel the pressing necessity to get to the practical- work which is before us. I hope that my friends will allow me, so far as they consistently can, to represent the general views held on this side, in the hope that we may, as soon as possible, get to the vital, practical matter which concerns the business of the whole community. But I, naturally, must make one or two observations, not so much on the old protection as on the new protection. The Treasurer is a living example of the old protection. He has lived politically on the old protection all his life, just as I might be fairly be said, in retort, to have lived on free-  trade all my life. </para>

                            <para>- I do not wish to use the expression in any offensive way. But the old protection has been the Treasurer&#39;s gospel, though he has not, perhaps, been able to understand it - there is no theory or inspiration in his case - as clearly as might some profound political economists. The honorable gentleman, However, has for many years been an earnest, whole-souled advocate of a protectionist policy. But, in the midst of all his enthusiasm and earnestness, this scheme of new protection never seems to have dawned on him. Has the honorable gentleman submitted this scheme to his friends in the Chamber - of Manufacturers? The members of that chamber have glowed over &#34; smoke night &#34; delights, which surrounded the honorable gentleman with a halo of things very much more substantial than smoke; but all those delights will disappear when the new protection is accomplished. The old protection always professed to regard the interests of the great mass of the workers in the factories; and it was on the faith of regard to those interests that .the people of Australia, and of other countries, adopted protection as a national policy. </para>

                            <para>- That was so. Of course, I have heard of such things in all political parties ; the policy of every political party has its drawbacks, and is .open to the same reproach. But there is the remarkable circumstance about protection that, although it is one of the oldest, best discussed, and best fought issues of politics in countries which have a high, state of civilization,&#39; this sort of new protection never seems, until now, to have been advocated, by any responsible Government. It would be a miracle in the Treasurer, but that we know miracles do not often occur in politics, and that he is fulfilling his vocation. The honorable gentleman is the mouthpiece of his masters. This is not his scheme; if he were in an incubator for 100 years, he could never hatch it. This scheme has no more to do with the Treasurer of today, than it has to do with him as we knew him many years ago. </para>

                            <para>- I shall deal with the merits of the scheme presently. Everything must be tested, not on the question whence it comes, but on the question whether it be good in itself. I quite admit that ; but before we begin to. discuss these matters we have to take our bearings a little. The plain English is that this scheme has been handed to the Treasurer by our friends in the Labour Party, and he has accepted it - he had to accept it. What chance had the Treasurer of putting this Tariff through unless he made terms with his masters? This is the bargain. I do not say it is a wrong bargain; that is a matter for judgment afterwards. I am not pronouncing a final opinion ; it would be presumptuous on my part to do so. I am simply taking the first impression which comes to one after the remarkable statement just made. I cannot help regarding this scheme as, I shall not say dictation, but as a bargain between the Government and the honorable members of the Labour Party,which put into words, means - &#34; You pass this scheme, and we will stand by you in this great Tariff fight.&#34; </para>

I hope I shall be ready to withdraw any observations which may seem to be unfair, but I have been long enough in politics to know that whether honorable members call it a bargain or not this proposal went on from the Caucus to the Minister, and that he has adopted it because the Caucus approves of it. That is a fair way of putting it. </para>

                            <para>- The Treasurer does know a good thing when he sees it. He knows that the good thing is the Labour Party, and he seizes it every time ; and I say more power to him, so long as its influence is properly exercised, and its effect is for the public good. I wish, before I deal with the new protection, to refer in a very few words to the honorable gentleman&#39;s observations on the fiscal question. He said he would put. the duties up as high as he could, in order to compel the manufacture locally of things which we can make in Australia. That expression is a dangerous one, coming from a responsible Minister. We can do anything in Australia if we choose to make a sufficient sacrifice in order to do it. Tropical plants could be grown in the arctic regions if people went to the expense of hot-houses. We can breed anything, and we can produce anything in Australia if we go to the necessary expense. But it is dangerous for a responsible Minister to speak in that unguarded, loose way. Let us take the case of the United States, with their high Tariff walls, behind which the Trusts of America have thriven&#39; so greatly. </para>

                            <para>- I did not propose to discuss the fiscal question at length, but merely to give the Committee some figures. I wish to point out that it is a policy of recklessness, which looks only at one object as the supreme end of statesmanship, and only at one set of industries as the industries to be regarded by Parliament. When I hear the term &#34;industry,&#34; I do not limit its range. I regard every industry of even the remotest districts of this mighty continent as just as much entitled to be studied and considered as the manufacturing industries of the great cities. It is one of the embarrassments of the situation that everything we give must come out of some pocket before we can give it, and though we may have a patriotic object in making gifts to particular industries, we should not forget that we are taking the gifts we bestow upon those industries, most of which are carried on in the large cities of the continent, from the masses of struggling men in the country districts of Australia. </para>

                            <para>-It is the sort of return of interest afterwards which does not occur with the regularity of a money-lending operation. I wish to impress upon the Committee that in the mighty United States, with their gigantic system of protection, the ordinary laws of commerce rise superior to all these obstacles. From the last figures which I was able to obtain, I find that the exports of the United States amount to  1,743  million dollars. We might expect the imports into these great States to be merely nominal, as compared with the volume of exports to which I have referred, but in spite of the enormous Tariff in the United States there are imports to that country of no less than  1,226  million dollars. These imports find their way into the United States in spite of the enormous Tariff barriers which have been set up so rigidly for so many years. </para>

                            <para>- But how do we stand if we compare the imports and exports of the Commonwealth, where the policy of protection and isolation has not been carried out to such an extent as in the United States? I find that under the old Tariff, which many protectionists look upon as a revenue Tariff, comparing our imports and exports with those of the United States, the proportion of imports to exports in the United States, with their terrific Customs duties, is  6  per cent. higher than the proportion of imports to exports in Australia. So honorable members should not be led away, and I do not think they will be, by these rash generalizations of the Minister. In spite of all our Tariffs and all our laws, the currents of commerce will continue to flow in two different directions. To attempt to make the mighty current of human energy and enterprise as embodied in commerce follow one direction is futile. We know that the law of every orb in the mighty skies as well as the law of energy is to travel, not in a straight line, but in a circle. Just as we have these vast orbs revolving in circles, so commerce revolves in circles. It cannot be run as we run railway engines - along a straight line of rails. In their earnest desire to advocate what they consider to be a national and patriotic policy, honorable members should not forget that in this mighty system of commerce, whilst the blood circulates outwards, it must come back again. I wish now to leave these references to protection and to come to a matter with which we are much more concerned. I made my position in connexion with this Tariff perfectly clear from the first. I said that I had been sent here by a constituency that believes in free-trade and a revenue Tariff. I propose to do my duty honestly and loyally to that constituency, and in accordance with the views I have enunciated during the whole of my political career. I know that honorable members who have been returned by constituencies sharing those views, will shaw equal, if not greater zeal and devotion in the matter, but <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> am also satisfied that we shall be guided by reason and political common sense. If we find we are in a hopeless minority upon some leading lines, and that it is impossible for us to impress our views upon the Committee - as indeed it might be if honorable members regarded their election pledges - I have no doubt that my honorable friends will not incessantly press the question of free-trade and protection on every line of the Tariff. </para>

                            <para>- It would be ridiculous to do so. It would do us no credit, and would do no good. I feel sure that, whilst strenuously endeavouring to carry out our views, we shall, throughout, assist those who have more moderate views than Ministers in making the duties proposed less extravagant than we think them to be. Leaving that matter now to come to the scheme of the new protection, I wish to say again that, in my opinion, this policy is infinitely sounder &#39;than the old protection. I have altogether disapproved of the policy of protection, and if the Opposition had suggested any such theories as those now submitted to us, what would have been the position? We have pointed out over and over again where protection fails ; that, instead of giving Australian labour its legitimate share of the benefits of its exactions from the great mass of the community, that share generally goes in other directions. I cannot claim any credit for originating any scheme of this sort, but what I do say is that, if we, the free-traders, had at any time until the last year or two proposed such a scheme, we should have been branded as men who, under the guise of being interested in the welfare of the working classes, were endeavouring to destroy the policy of protection. This policy of the new protection, however, has come from a quarter which is not exposed to that suspicion. So far as I can see, the credit for the idea is one to which the Labour Party is legitimately entitled. I do not know of any person not associated with them who has brought it prominently forward. The object, I think, is a thoroughly sound one. </para>

                            <para>- I endeavour to emulate the forbearance which my honorable friends of the Labour Party sometimes show towards one another. I give the Labour Parties of Australia the credit of this movement, if it be a good one. Its object is certainly a good one. What has evolved this, new protectionist policy? What has led tens of thousands who have no expectation of direct benefit from this taxation to adopt such a policy at the risk of losing by it? It has been, first of all, a desire to encourage the growth of new industries as a means of employing labour. But the main &#39;argument which has enabled protection to prevail to the extent to which it has done is that if we are ever to have manufacturing industries .of our own . we must do something to equalize the conditions obtaining  here and elsewhere, so that manufacturers in Australia can flourish under labour conditions which are congenial to Australia. The attempt to compete with labour in less fortunate conditions has been looked upon, and, I think, wisely, as hopeless, except in connexion with the great natural industries of the country. So far as those industries are concerned, we can compete night and day with all countries. The real strength of Australia has been derived,, not from the nourishment we obtain by living on one another, but from the glorious strength which has come to this country from the development of the great natural riches and resources which we possess. That has been the true source of all the greatness of Australia, including even the greatness of our manufacturing industries. But since this new scheme is to be the basis of the protection to be granted, I think Parliament is absolutely justified in endeavouring to see that Australian manufacturers who  reap the benefit . of Australian protection honestly give their employes Australian conditions and wages. </para>

                            <para>- I wish to say at once that the object aimed at by this new protection has my thorough sympathy. There are two points in connexion with it, however, which must be Carefully considered. The question as to fair and reasonable labour conditions is not a difficult one. It is not so difficult as is the question of prices, which involves many other conditions. Quality has a great deal to do with price. One manufacturer might be selling 30 per cent. below his neighbour, yet the higher-priced goods might represent more honest value to the consumer. These are troubles which I do not propose to dwell upon, since they are obvious. </para>

                            <para>- The melancholy feature of this proposal is that all those measures for the protection of industry which were passed with desperate zeal, are within twelve months confessedly failures. The Australian Industries Preservation Bill was to destroy the enemies of fair dealing. Combines and trusts were to be crushed by that magnificent measure .; yet, within twelve months of its passing, the Minister admits that it is defective in a most serious respect. I have never seen the Government make an honest attempt to bring it into operation. Then, again, let us glance at the operation of the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act. That Act, which was passed about twelve months ago, provided that from 1st January,1907, certain Excise duties should be payable on all agricultural machinery specified in the schedule. From 1 st January last, under that Act, Excise has been due on every agricultural implement manufactured in Australia and included in the schedule, but has one penny of that Excise been collected? </para>

                            <para>- I am looking at the general scope of the Act. We know what is the position when duties of Customs are imposed. From the very instant when a Customs duty is proposed, it has to be paid, and it is collected even before the Tariff itself has become law. Yet not one penny has been collected in the way of Excise under the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act, although I dare say not one-twentieth of the manufacturers engaged in the industries to which it relates have been brought, or have had even a chance of being brought, within a determination of the Court. The whole thing is an abject failure. </para>

                            <para>- I should be very sorry to look upon difficulty as an argument for stagnation. I am only pointing out that the result of the measure in question has been a little discouraging. Do honorable members remember the exact title of the Anti-Trust. Bill? The Australian Industries Preservation Bill ! That is a beautiful rhetorical expression ; a sort of name which suggested that the moment the Act was passed fresh oxygen would be supplied to every industry in Australia. That supply has not yet come; so far we have had nothing but nitrogen. The policy enunciated by the Treasurer has only one delightful feature. I refer to the fact that it provides for the appointment of another Board. That is, at least, one charm about it. </para>

But I am heartily in accord with the project of insuring that the manufacturers shall pay fair wages under these duties, and I should like to see some sensible method of carrying it out. It is equally important with regard to the questions of price, if anything can be effectively done. </para>

                            <para>- Do not let us talk of harvesters. Who is the man whose books the Government cannot look at? What is his name? He was the archangel of this Ministry a year or so ago, when he was getting a duty on his harvesters and strippers. I do not know whether he represents the firm who will not show their books, but they are such a big firm that it is highly probable. If the prices go down under the influence of this protectionist Tariff, need we concern ourselves about extortion? The very Minister who pointed to this policy as a remedy for extortion - a policy under which some mysterious persons in different degrees of latitude and longitude beyond the- coast-line of Australia paid all the duties - now tells us that extortion is possible even under this benign policy. . </para>

                            <para>- There will be no need for us, as mankind will be perfect, and will not need political healers, who, while always professing to heal the body politic are causing fresh sores to break out in other directions. But I say that both objects are sound. Both are objects with legitimate motives. One is in the interests of the man in whose behalf this protection is substantially given, because I have always said, and, I hope, sincerely felt, that when dealing with struggles between capital and labour, while we should be absolutely fair to the manufacturer and capitalist, and see that he gets, as he is entitled to get, a fair and legitimate return for his enterprise - his share of the fruits of national industy&#39; - we should, when we are dealing with masses of labour, remember that we are dealing with men to whom a mistake to their detriment is a cruel hardship. If we make a mistake which is, perhaps, to some extent,, injurious to the mighty power of capital, we have the consolation of knowing that capital will still get its bread and butter after all these mistakes have been operative, but in the case of men who live every day on the narrow margin between manly independence and want, ! say every time that I would give them the benefit of any doubt in connexion with any political difficulty. I hope, however, that, in our desire to see that Labour gets its fair conditions, we shall also endeavour to see that even the Australian manufacturer, who risks his capital in these undertakings, obtains a fair and legitimate return. </para>

                            <para>- - I admit that difficulties are incidental to every new proposal. There is scarcely a reform which has come to work smoothly to-day which at its inception was not ridiculed as impracticable, and was not, in the beginning, full of actual difficulties. But the fact that there are difficulties in the way of this project ought not to affect us, except to inspire us with a desire to endeavour to remove them. I am not going into the question at any length at present. It will require considerable discussion. I hope, however, that the practical discussion of it will take place, not now, but when we come to deal with the measure which must embody it. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly. Of course. I can only speak for myself. The honorable member is entirely. independent of any attitude I may take up. I only say. in advance that I am going to give the matter the fairest and most favorable consideration. But it is only fair to point out that the Excise Tariff Act of 1906 has not yet been tested ; nor can it very well be tested until some attempt is made to collect the Excise. In fact, one cannot go before the High Court on questions of any kind unless one has a substantial interest in some issue which has arisen. The moment the matter comes to a stage at which it can be tested, the probability is that a very serious constitutional question will arise- </para>

                            <para>- It seems so; but there is a good deal of wisdom in that rule, because it is a very favorable condition for getting the best possible decision, that there should be people who have a personal and practical interest in fighting out the issue.. If Courts were required to give <inline font-style="italic">ex cathedra</inline> opinions, a Court might afterwards find, in the contest of a particular concrete case, that its previous opinion, given under less favorable conditions, was entirely wrong, and that previous decision might have been a source of misleading, to the prejudice of a very large number of people. On the whole, it is a wise provision that these questions should come up in the usual form. So long as no one objects to the Act, <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> it is constitutional, and it may turn out to be constitutional in fact ; but I have in my mind the well-established legal principle that &#34; What you have no power to do directly, you have no power to do indirectly.&#34; That is a principle which would cut right into this question. We have no power directly to interfere with the wages conditions in any factory in Australia. On the contrary, the Constitution, in matters&#34; connected with industrial conditions- </para>

                            <para>- On that point, clearly the common-sense argument would be against the validity of such an Act. The proposal is not intended for the purpose of carrying out a system- of Excise to the extent of one-half of the existing duties. That is not the object of the Act. If the main object of the Excise were to make the colonial manufacturer pay, by way of Excise, half of the duty imposed, perhaps some weight might be attached to the honorable member&#39;s argument. </para>

What is the use of such words if under the trade and commerce provision of the Constitution the Commonwealth has the power to solve the  labour . conditions of every person who is engaged in manufacture? If we have the power to deal with the labour conditions of the manufacturer, we must have the power to deal with the labour conditions of other branches of trade and commerce, because manufacturers are not the only persons who come under the heading &#34; trade and commerce.&#34; In that case, we have the power to enter the warehouse of an importer and say to him, &#34; We will charge you 30 per cent, more upon your imports of woollen goods unless you pay your men better wages. &#34; </para>

There is no doubt that a lawyer always likes a client who is &#34; distinctly &#34; of opinion, because it leads to a large volume of business. One of the most cheering features associated with all these well meant endeavours to produce better conditions of labour is that they invariably promote the success of the most deserving class in Australia - a class to which I need not more closely allude. </para>

                            <para>- I would like the honorable member to recollect that nobody who has the power of acting under an instrument is permitted by any ingenuity to enlarge the terms of that instrument. If by the exercise of ingenuity we could get outside the powers conferred by a Constitution Act, the instrument would not be worth much. The first canon of construction is : What is the teal inwardness of this Act ? What is its real sphere and operation ? Does this power come within the real sphere and operation of the expression &#34;trade and commerce&#34;? If it does, it is sound, but if not, all the contrivances in the world will not make it sound. But we cannot be sure of these things until we have obtained the decision of a Court which is final in these matters. That is what I always admire in reference to the High Court of Australia - where it is final it is sure to be right. But where it is not final, it is sometimes a little like other Courts. There is only one tribunal in which a final decision of this matter can be obtained. I merely express the hope that vital as are the interests connected with this Tariff,, and strongly as we may desire to impress our own views upon it, we shall all combine to do two things - first to expedite, as far as we reasonably can, the despatch of this important business, and, secondly, to endeavour each to do his duty without the intrusion of those angry and disturbing influences which are so apt to upset the Treasurer. </para>

                        <para>.  - When the leader of the Opposition rose to speak I left the Chamber in order to procure a short financial statement, which I prepared yesterday in relation to the Tariff and its operation. This statement bears so closely upon some expressions which have been made use of to-day by the Treasurer that I intend&#39; to place it before the Committee for the benefit of honorable members, and also because I desire that it may be put upon record in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> so that twelve months hence we may have before us not only the figures supplied by the Treasurer, &#62;but such statistics as I think ought to have been presented when the Tariff was submitted for our consideration. There are two or three points which I especially desire to emphasize. One of these was referred to the other evening by the Treasurer when he read a statement from the <inline font-style="italic">Board of Trade Journal,</inline> setting forth that the average duty imposed under the revenue Tariff of Russia was 131 per cent., whilst that under the Commonwealth Tariff was only 6 per cent. I was so astonished at the time he made this declaration that I immediately referred to the Board of Trade returns in the hope that I might be able to elucidate the principle upon which that body had presented such a misleading statement. I cannot, however, ascertain the particulars which have led to its conclusions. I can only find that the average duty of 6 per cent, related to the impost upon all the textiles and manufactured articles exported by Great Britain to Australia. I immediately made my own calculations in respect to the Tariff of last  year, and the revenue which it yielded, and I found that the average duty levied under it was equivalent to 24 per cent. </para>

                            <para>- The imports from Germany and America - which are the chief countries from which we import, apart from Great Britain - are infinitesimal as compared with the great bulk of our imports. I come to my next point. It was very interesting to me this afternoon to hear the Treasurer refer to the revenue returns for the past three months, and especially to those for the past month. I rejoice with him that our States are not only showing so manifestly the benefit of good seasons, but are also showing that the Tariff is going to be a very large revenue producer. But if I  occu-pied  an important position as a member of the Opposition, I should be very much disposed to challenge the Government on the ground that the figures which have been placed before us in the financial statement do not disclose the true position of the Commonwealth under the new Tariff. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly not; but the Treasurer has not taken advantage of the figures supplied to him to point .out the true financial position of the Commonwealth under the Tariff now proposed. If I were the  chairman  of a public company, making a statement as to its financial position, I should be expected to show my hand fully, and let the members of the company see what their position was likely to be during the current year at least. I remember that when <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner delivered his Budget statement in connexion with the introduction of the Kingston Tariff he pointed out that whereas under the Tariff, as proposed, the revenue might be ,&#163;9,000,000, yet in. the course of a few years - I think he said within five years - the normal revenue under it would be reduced to about &#163;5,000,000. That statement was challenged at the time. Some of us thought that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner&#39;s view of the Tariff, as preventing the importation of goods from abroad, and assisting in their manufacture in Australia, was unsound, and that it would not within five years operate to such an extent! as to build up factories as he expected. I recollect that, notwithstanding that Tariff - which was a high Tariff, even after it was cut down in Parliament </para>

Coming back to the point which I wished to make and put on record, I hope honorable members will follow me closely, and that if I am wrong some one will set me right. I have no desire to mislead honorable members and the public. The facts and figures are as open to them as they are to me. I devoted almost the whole of yesterday to this investigation of the subject. I entered upon it because I thought the Treasurer made a mistake in the figures he quoted relating to our trade with Great Britain. </para>

As we deal with various items of the Tariff I shall point out from time to time that there are goods imported from Ita&#39;ly, Germany, and the United States which there is no likelihood of our having manufactured in this country - at all events, at any period during the life of any one at present living. Australia will not become a manufacturer of these goods for many years to come, no matter how high may be the Tariff wall that we build up against them. </para>

                            <para>- The duties on narcotics and stimulants average 155 per cent. Next we come to goods which pay composite duties and specific duties. They pay on an average over 30 per cent. Then we have the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties ranging from 5 to 30 per cent. A great mass of our imports which pay <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties come in at 10, 15, 20, and 25- per cent., and a small proportion - less than &#163;&#91;300,000 -come in at 30 per cent. The principal object with which I rose was to point out that the financial statement of the Government does not disclose truly to the Commonwealth the financial position even for the current year under the new Tariff. The figures which I wish honorable members to consider are these: The dutiable goods imported in 1906 were ,&#163;27,254,000; bullion and&#39; specie imported - upon which there is no duty - amounted to ,&#163;2,330,917 ; and the remaining free imports to &#163;&#91;15,144,466. The total goods imported into Australia amounted to &#163;&#34;44,729,506. The free list under the present Tariff will be worth about ,&#163;4,000,000. Of course, my estimate is a very rough one, and may be out &#163;200,000 or &#163;&#91;300,000. </para>

                            <para>- That is. not what I am speaking of. I say that the free-list under the old Tariff was worth &#163;15,000,000, and under the new Tariff is about &#163;4,000,000. The estimate of revenue for the current year is &#163;10,509,000, and the amount received last year was &#163;9,648,000, so that it is estimated that the  revenue under the new Tariff  will  show an increase of nearly  &#163;900,000.  Last year&#39;s revenue was an increase on that of the previous year of  , &#163;800,000. </para>

                            <para>- Last year was not entirely a boom year. In more than one year since  1901 we  have received an equivalent revenue return, though there was a falling-off in the year  1905-6.  During the current year  we  may presume that there will  be  an increase of revenue due to the great prosperity of the country to which the Minister referred, of which all honorable members were glad to hear. But no allowance seems to have been made for that. Last year <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties were collected on imports valued at  &#163;18,900,000,  and fixed duties on imports valued at   &#163;6,000,000,  our dutiable imports amounting in all to about  &#163;25,000,000,  excluding stimulants and narcotics, and bullion and specie, while  &#163;15,000,000  of free goods were imported. Of course, any estimate that I may make must  be  a very rough one, because it would require a great deal of calculation  by  the officials of the Customs Department to produce anything like accuracy of detail. Assuming the new Tariff increases our duties  by  about71/2 per cent. on the average, though there are instances in which the increase is  20  per cent., and even  100  per cent. </para>

                            <para>- Taking it at71/2 per cent., it means an increase of about  &#163;1,893,000  in the revenue from the &#163;25,000,000 of imports which, were dutiable under the old Tariff. And under this Tariff another  &#163;11,000,000  of imports are dutiable which last year were free. Putting the duties on those imports at  10  per cent, which is well within the mark, they will yield a revenue of  &#163;1,100,000,  making the probable increase under the new Tariff  &#163;2,993,000.  This estimate coincides strangely with that made  by  the leader of the Opposition just now, in multiplying the increase for last month -  &#163;2 50,000 - by  twelve, which brings the increase for the year to  &#163;3,000,000.  It is to  be  noted that this increase will not foe for one year only,  because  a large number of the goods on which duties have been increased cannot  be  made in Australia for years to come. In conclusion, I wish to ask  by  whom will this increase have to  be  paid ? Possibly Ministers are under the impression that it will be paid by those known as the classes. But, in my opinion, it will be paid by the masses. They will discover that this extra revenue is largely being collected from them. I have come to that conclusion as the result of experience, not only as an importer, but as Treasurer of Tasmania or* various occasions - in which position it was my duty to observe the incidence of taxation, to discover as nearly as possible what burdens were borne by the working classes and what by the well-to-do. The proportion of the burdens of the masses to those of the classes is very great. In his admirable book on the income tax, Leoni Levi published a diagram showing Teneriffe with its peak,  15,000  feet high, and its base submerged. That enormous base represented the masses in Great Britain whose incomes could not be taxed by reason of the fact that they fell below the exemption of  &#163;150,  while, as the peak grew smaller and smaller, it indicated the numbers of those who paid! the tax. I have followed out that idea on many occasions in Australia. I have found that in the case of <inline font-style="italic">an</inline> income tax with an. exemption of  &#163;150,  comparatively few of the masses could be taxed. It seems almost incredible that the number of persons in Australia who pay income tax with an exemption of &#163;150. do not represent21/2per cent. of the population. Who, then, will bear the burden of the extra  &#163;3,000,000  of taxation which is imposed by this Tariff? </para>

                            <para>- Certainly not, but we all like to see girls fairly well dressed. Who does not delight in seeing&#39; girls - domestic servants or factory workers - well dressed?These girls will be well dressed. The silk blouse is made, not from silk manufactured in England, but from silk manufactured at the Liberty Silk Mills in Illinois. Since the revocation of the edict of Nantes, in 1685, when the Protestants of France journeyed to Coventry and Spitalfields, England has not been able to overtake the manufacture of silk and to compete with France. It is from France, and not from England, that our silks are coming. With a community of 4,000,000 persons!, . there is no chance of our ever being able to manufacture silk. </para>

                            <para>- If I had the list before me I could point out over and over again where the duty on an article has been raised from id. to Itd. or  2d.  per lb., or from  25  to  40  per cent. On one line only, cotton and linen piece goods imported last year,  &#163;3,300,000,  the extra duty is  5  per cent., and will yield two-thirds of the increased revenue estimated by the Treasurer. The Tariff as a whole is an immense advance on any previous Tariff. The effect will be to throw a great burden on the masses, instead of on the wealthy. </para>

                            <para>- As we proceed with the consideration of the Tariff I will show that, although five years ago we imposed high duties on apparel, textiles, earthenware, glassware, musical instruments, and other articles, the value of those articles has increased during the intervening period. We shall witness a similar result under this Tariff. Even if we adopt the high duties which Ministers have proposed,, the great bulk of those articles required by , the community will continue to come in. We are not ready to overtake the supply,, and the merchants,, importers, and others are afraid to make themselves ready to do&#176; so, because of the labour conditions. Hari&#39; it not been for the labour conditions in Tasmania, I would have started a factory there years ago. But we are manufacturing to a large extent already in Tasmania. </para>

                            <para>- No, certainly not ; anybody who is aware how my clerks, were paid, and of the bonuses they received for twenty or thirty years, knows that I do not believe in sweating. Ever* on a  20  per cent. Tariff in Tasmania - the highest ever imposed while I was Premier - the manufacturers incidentally opened their mills. There is no more joyful sound than the factory bell day by day, and we can realize no more satisfactory result than, year by year, to find our woollen manufacturers, bootmakers, straw-hat makers, and so forth, increasing in numbers. Those manufacturers do not ask for any higher duty; indeed, they deprecate any increase. What were the facts laid before the members of the Tariff Commission ? We are told that the manufacturers of Tasmania asked that the Tariff might be left as it was - stating that duties of  20  per cent, were high enough;, and it is in that spirit that I shall approach the consideration of the Tariff.. At the same time, as I said before, if any industry has been injured by the former Tariff, I am prepared to remedy the mischief. There is no occasion, however, in remedying a mischief of that kind, to impose &#39;higher duties than will give a fair return for the investment. And who can say that the manufacturers are not at present securing, a very fair remunerative return on their capital? We have heard a good deal about the Denton Hat Mills ; but what have those mills to compete against? A few thousands pounds worth of hats come from Italy and Germany - 1 think I am right in saying there is not more than  &#163;40,000  worth per annum altogether - and yet the proprietors of those mills, which pay dividends of  10  per cent, time after time, who have money written off the value of the machinery, and a reserve fund, are always asking for more protection. Industries which have been forced in a hot-house atmosphere always continue to ask for more consideration ; in the United States, for example, the Tariff has been raised over and over again as a wall against the outside world.. I have dealt with matters to which I had no idea of referring. My object was simply to have placed on record the fact, as disclosed by the figures placed before us, that the Tariff we are asked to sanction will give an increased return of not &#163;&#91;1,000,000, out more nearly &#163;&#91;3,000,000 increase for the current year. </para>

                        <para>.- I have given notice to move that seventy-nine items which are enumerated shall be passed <inline font-style="italic">en bloc.</inline> My reason is that the proposals of the Government, in regard to these items, are in accord with the old Tariff, and also in accord with the unanimous recommendations of the Commission. Under the circumstances, I thought that greater expedition might be attained by passing these items <inline font-style="italic">en bloc;</inline> and, after making inquiries, I do not think that any honorable member will object to the suggestion. I should like to ask your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> whether I am in order in submitting that motion? I can assure the Government that my only object is to expedite business. </para>

                            <para>- And that might not be desirable from the point of view of some people. I should like to make what remarks I have to make now, and then ask your ruling, sir, as to the submission of my proposal. Only one question of any real importance has been brought before the Committee to-day. The Treasurer has told us nothing new in his references to the value of imports into Australia. The item &#34; straw,&#34; which he specially referred to, was very unimportant, as only some 3 cwt. was imported last year. In the new protection, as it is called, however, an important principle is involved. I do not desire to commit myself to any definite expression of opinion&#39; at the present time, because, as yet, we have not had an opportunity to carefully consider the matter. Indeed, I did not quite hear the Treasurer in everything he said on the question. It seems to me, however, that the scheme proposed may, in some respects, be acceptable, in regard to monopolies and combinations, though it appears to me too far-reaching in its effects. I do not know whether I understood the Treasurer correctly, but does he intend this new protection to apply to. every industry throughout the country, including agricultural and pastoral industries, which are not,- as we know, within the operation of the Arbitration Acts of Australia? Stock, meat, butter, wheat, and so forth are produced under very different circumstances and conditions from those of ordinary manufactures. Did I understand the Treasurer to say that agricultural and pastoral industries are to be included? </para>

                            <para>- It is important that we should know at once whether the new Excise duties are to apply to the agricultural productions of the country. It seems to me that the Treasurer is proposing to do only what was done seven or eight years -ago in Western Australia, and what has been already done in New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia, and that is, to provide that those engaged in manufacturing industries shall have an opportunity of having their wages regulated by an Arbitration Court. That has been the law in most parts of Australia for years. I did not gather that the proposals now made by the Treasurer will go any further than the law which now exists. I do not know that such provision has been made in Queensland or in Tasmania, but there is a law in South Australia! under which the wages in an industry can be regulated. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. I mean wages, hours, and other conditions of labour -can at the present time be regulated in all the States, with the exception possibly of Queensland and Tasmania, and it therefore seems to me that there is no justification for all the noise that has been made about the new protection. I am not satisfied that it will confer any additional benefit on workers in the State from which I come, where the wages and conditions of labour are regulated by an Arbitration Court. </para>

                            <para>- I am aware of that, but that was because the employes would not accept the decisions of the Arbitration Court. We may expect to have strikes in every State, if either the employers or the employes will not abide by the decisions of the Courts. Though I say it with regret, I think the rule has been&#62; that employes have not been content to abide by decisions which have not been in&#62; their favour. </para>

I very much regret to say that, so far as I have been able to judge, the employers, whether satisfied or not, have complied with the law, whilst the employes seem to think that arbitration courts are constituted in order to increase wages, and so soon as a diminution of wages is proposed think they are at liberty to disobey the law. </para>

I regret to have to say this, because I suppose we all desire to avoid strikes. I introduced an Arbitration and Conciliation Bill in the Western Australian Parliament against the wishes of many of those whose opinions I valued, and there was no Labour Party in the State Parliament in those days. A statement has been made, I think, by the Treasurer, to the effect that if it were not for the presence of Labour members in this House, no liberal legislation would take place. </para>

                            <para>- No, but we had legislation regulating labour conditions apart from the Tariff. I have regretted very much to hear from the Minister, or from some one else, that if there were no direct Labour representatives in this House legislation of this kind would not be brought forward. </para>

                            <para>- I think that such a statement is a calumny. It is a very ungrateful and improper statement to make, seeing that a great deal of such legislation on the statute-books of the different States was passed long before there was a Labour Party in Parliament. If honorable members will search the statute-book of Western Australia they will find that there was more liberal legislation passed before there was a Labour Party in the Parliament than has been passed since. </para>

He should say nothing about me, because I am in a position to retort, and to ask that I should be judged not, like him, by what he has talked about, but by what I have done; There was no justification for the statement made by the Treasurer that, until the advent of the Labour Party, there was no liberalism in the legislation of Western Australia. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member said, at all events, that I had done nothing. To return, however, to the proposal immediately before us, I think -that the scheme for regulating prices will be difficult to carry out. We all agree that some means should be devised to prevent the public from being victimized by combines or monopolies ; but it seems to me that the regulation of prices is impossible. I could quite understand the appointment of a Board of Trade similar to that in operation in  Great Britain which would control, to some extent, railways, and trade and. commerce generally, and report to Parliament in regard to any injustice suffered by the community in connexion with those matters ; but an attempt by Parliament or a Board to fix the price of every item that is dutiable under the Tariff would be as impossible as it is unnecessary. Such a procedure would destroy competition, and do away with the spirit of emulation and enterprise. I do not think that when We get to close quarters the Treasurer, who generally has a keen eye for the main chance, will .pursue this project to its ultimate conclusion. </para>

I was very glad to hear the honorable member say that it was not intended to apply the new protection to the agricultural and pastoral industries. If that stand be adopted, I am sure we shall view the Government proposals from a different stand-point from that which we should otherwise do. So long as these proposals are restricted to the manufacturers, who are controlled at present in New South Wales and Western Australia by Conciliation and Arbitration Acts, and in Victoria and South Australia by Wages Boards, I do not think that they .will affect to any large extent either employers or employes. I have only to say,, in conclusion, that I should like to know when the Minister proposes to proceed with &#34;the scheme of new protection outlined by him. </para>

                            <para>-  So far as I am aware, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> the governing clauses were not put, and that being so, I claim that they have not been passed by the Committee. The putting of a subsequent item could not affect them, and in the circumstances, I think that the Committee should have an opportunity, if it be desired, to amend the governing clauses or to discuss an amendment of them at a later stage. Had they been put and passed by the Committee, the position would be different. In that event, I should recognise that we had passed the stage at which they could be amended. But as I understand that they have not been put, I submit that they are not affected by the putting of a subsequent item. </para>

                            <para>- My desire is to follow on this occasion the practice that was followed when the last Tariff was being considered, and also the practice, so far as we can ascertain it, followed in the consideration of Tariffs in the States Parliaments. May&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Practice</inline> is of little or no use to us as a guide in this particular instance. My own opinion is that the introductory clauses are merely explanatory, and will have to be embodied in the Bill which will be introduced to enact the Tariff before they can become law. The proper subjects for discussion in the Committee of Ways and Means are the items dealing with the amount of duties to be imposed. &#39; The first paragraph, &#34; That duties of Customs and duties of Excise be imposed according to the following Tariff,&#34; will be put at the end of the items of the Tariff in the same way as the preamble and the title of a Bill are put. </para>

                            <para>- Unless it is agreed that there shall be no discussion, or only a short discussion, the Government must adhere to the order of the items as they appear in the Tariff. If a motion is made to postpone a large number of items in order to bring on one particular item, a discussion can take place with regard to every item which it is proposed to postpone. The result would be endless delay. It will be quite a different thing if I get an intimation from the Committee that there is not going to be a long discussion. In that case it may be possible to meet the Committee in perhaps two or three cases. Under no other conditions can the Government agree to a motion to allow this or that item to take precedence over a number of others. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable member wants to delay the consideration of the Tariff, he is taking the proper course to achieve that object. The Government are anxious, and so aim I, to deal with the items in the Tariff as soon as we possibly can. The honorable member for Robertson heard the intimation given by the honorable member for Kalgoorlie. That shows that the moment it is proposed to postpone a large section of the Tariff in favour of one    item, other honorable members will ask for the same consideration for other items. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think so. At any rate, at the present time it will only mean delay in dealing with the Tariff, and also delay in reaching the very item to which the honorable member wants to give precedence. No one wants to deal with the items quicker than the Government and I do. If the honorable member will allow the consideration of the Tariff to proceed  in the ordinary way, certainly nothing will be postponed so far as the Government are concerned until after the tobacco duties are considered. They come next after the division before the Chair. </para>

                            <para>- The Government cannot agree to that course at present. I hope that the honorable member, and others who are anxious to reach that item at an early date, will not move catch motions of the kind he has indicated. The Government, while they have charge of the business of the Committee, cannot agree to anything of the kind. When the tobacco duties have been dealt with, the Government may, perhaps, consider then whether what the honorable member suggests is possible, but they will certainly not agree to do it in any shape or form if there is to be a long debate on the merits of the items which it is proposed to postpone. I wish to emphasize this, so that we may know where we are before we go any further in connexion with the Tariff. It is a very serious matter to postpone one-half or one-third of the Tariff in order to give precedence to a particular item. Many honorable members desire to deal with the machinery duties as soon as possible and the same applies to the duties on chairs and magazines. </para>

                        <para>.- Will the honorable member allow me to interpose before he moves the motion? I am sorry to interrupt him, but I would suggest that, as the Minister exhibits an inclination to consider this matter a little further after we have dealt with the tobacco duties, and as I know that several delegates from workmen&#39;s unions connected with the tobacco trade have been here for weeks waiting for that division to come on, it would be just as well if we dealt with the tobacco duties at once. It might afterwards be considered whether certain other items should be taken first. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not know exactly what the right honorable member for Swan wished to infer. The proposals of the Government in reference to what is known as the new protection deal with the question of the wages payable by manufacturers. That is the proposal so far as it has gone. As I have already stated, the intention is that the Government shall formulate a list of items or manufactures over which the Board will have control. I think that the right honorable member for Swan asked me whether the proposals of the Government were applicable to the farmers. My impression is that they do not apply to farmers, but merely to manufacturers and to the wages paid by them to their employes. </para>

                            <para>- The Government will bring the Bill forward at what they deem to be the proper time. There is scarcely any necessity to introduce it until the consideration of the Tariff has been nearly completed. I desire also to make another statement in this connexion, if I may be permitted to do so. If the Senate , is not fully occupied with other work, when, say, one-third - or perhaps a little more - of the Tariff proposals have been dealt with, I believe that we can embody those proposals in a Bill, and forward them to the other Chamber to be dealt with whilst we are considering the remaining portions of the Tariff. </para>

                            <para>- The position will be considered by the Government. If what I have suggested can be done, without one division of the Tariff clashing with another, it will be done. Of course it will not be done if clashing cannot be avoided, because we&#39; all recognise that some of the items hang one upon the other. Any part of the Tariff dealt with separately must be symmetrical. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; and the object of the Government is to complete the consideration of the Tariff before Christmas. I dp not think there is any other way in which, that result can be accomplished than that I have indicated. I shall not attempt to give effect to the proposal in the face of any serious opposition, but the desire of the Government is to get the consideration of the Tariff completed as soon as possible. That is my only reason for making the suggestion. I hope that the honorable member for Robertson will not move in trie direction he has indicated, bur if he does I ask honorable members to support me in controlling the business of the Committee. &#171; </para>

                        <para>. - I am very reluctant to interpose in this debate, but we are asked to pass certain proposals in the Tariff. As a reason for passing them, we have been informed that a system embodying protection-, for the workmen employed in the industries protected by the Tariff, will be put before us. I quite agree with the Treasurer  that  we ought not, perhaps, to expect the Bill conferring that protection to be placed before us at the present stage, but I do say that we ought to have an outline Of the principles of the measure so that we mav deaf with the Ministerial proposals in an enlightened way. But what do we find ? We are asked - in view of promised legislation- - to impose duties which must seriously affect the community, and yet we are told&#34; bv the Minister who proposes it, that he does not know what are the provisions of that legislation. </para>

                            <para>- The Treasurer has just stated that he did not think that the proposals of the Government would&#39; lie extended to the agricultural and pastoral industries, but he could not say positively. How can he take exception to my remark that he admits he has not vet formulated his ideas upon the matter when he can give no information upon that important issue? In a variety qf ways the scheme outlined by the Government is absolutely - unworkable! </para>

                    <para class="block">Prom my stand-point, I regard with some pleasure the proposed check on the too greedy requirements of some manufacturers to the injury of the community. I regard it also as undoubtedly just that, if manufacturers are going to get heavy protection because of the high prices they pay for labour, we ought to see that the reason they give for requiring that protection is substantiated by the payment of reasonable wages. I also agree that it is desirable in regard to trusts and combines, and the question of whether manufacturers are entitled to the benefit of duties if they are combining and charging excessive prices, that such matters should be dealt with, not by a Minister, and not in the first place even by this Parliament, but by some independent Board. My only objection to a Board is on the ground of the increased expenditure, which we are piling up in connexion with one thing and another in Commonwealth affairs. But I do say that when a Minister has proposals of this sort to make to Parliament, and when he asks Parliament to adopt certain provisions in a Tariff in view of them, he ought clearly to outline the proposals. The present slipshod method of doing business will not bring this Parliament into credit.&#39; I have never known, in my experience, of any Parliament - and I have never read of any Parliament - passing a measure requiring some other measure to complete it, without knowing what were the provisions that were to appear in the second measure. The Minister has said that he cannot for the present say definitely whether agricultural or pastoral industries will be affected. He has said that the proposals of the Government will apply to all manufactures which are protected by the Tariff. Now, there are manufactures connected with agriculture and with pastoral pursuits. The wine industry extends throughout. Australia. There are heavy duties on imported wines. There is the butter industry, and there are many other rural industries. But we are quite in ignorance as to whether they will be affected by the proposals of the Government. According to the Minister&#39;s statement, all manufactures that are protected by the Tariff will be affected. If so, will these rural industries be affected ? Then he creates another difficulty. He says that the old Tariff was not protective, but was a revenue Tariff - that it did not protect the industries of Australia. As he is proposing to interfere only with industries that are protected, does he mean that his proposals will interfere only with those industries that receive the benefit of raised duties under the new Tariff, or are the proposals to extend to all the industries of Australia producing articles dutiable as imports under the Tariff? We have had no explanation on that point. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister admits that many duties under the old Tariff were revenue duties. Some of those duties are increased under the new Tariff, and some are not. Are only those which, in the Minister&#39;s opinion, are protective duties to be affected by the proposals of the Government, and is there to be some method of defining what is a protective duty? We have had no explanation on that point. Again, the Minister says that he proposes to impose an Excise duty wherever there is protection, and, if proper wages are paid, to remit the Excise. </para>

                            <para>- We ought to have that list. Surely when we are dealing with Customs duties we ought to know to what manufactures the Excise proposals are to apply. The proposal is that Excise duties will be remitted if certain satisfactory conditions are observed. But that proposal apparently does not apply to those very large and important items of manufacture in connexion with which Excise duties are already imposed. What is to be done in regard to the Excise duties which at present apply to beer, sugar, and a number of other commodities? Those questions show how imperfect is the information that we have. The Minister&#39;s proposal absolutely breaks down in connexion with those large industries. Are they to be dealt with or are they not? Are they to be a favoured exception, or are they to be brought under the scope of the new legislation ? We have no information on that point. The Minister has not explained a number of other matters. If, for instance, the duties which he proposes are imposed, and increase the cost of living - as they must do - he has not explained how he is going to benefit those other workers who are not engaged in the industries, but who have to suffer on account of the higher cost of living. The figures given by the Minister show there is this increased cost. The Minister quoted the prices charged for a number of articles about which he sent an officer to get information. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member may be right. The prices of candles, soap, and starch, of Australian manufacture, were quoted, and as to the cocoa mentioned, it was not stated whether it was imported or locally made, although a considerable quantity is made locally. In each instance prices have been raised, although the cost of Australian-made articles has not been increased by the increase of duties. The Minister has made no statement in regard to the very important matters to which I have alluded. Unfortunately, we are getting into the loose habit of passing legislation before we have received from the Ministry sufficient information to enable us to judge of its probable effect. We ought to know - I do not say in detail, because I do not expect the Treasurer to have a Bill ready- </para>

                            <para>- One or two amendments which I moved, and which the Minister accepted, made the Australian Industries Preservation Bill more effective for its purpose, but, although attention was called to many imperfections, the measure was passed without consideration being given by the Ministry to most of the criticisms levelled against it. It is the duty of&#39; Parliament, before it acts, to know what it is being asked to do ; but do the members of this Committee know what are the proposals of the Ministry in regard to what has been termed the new protection ? </para>

                            <para>- The fact that legislation is to be introduced to modify the effect of the Tariff is expected to affect the decisions of members of the Committee. Therefore we should know what it is. My reason for intruding in the debate just now is to protest against the. slipshod methods prevailing, which, if honorable members gave consideration to the matter and expressed their real opinion, they would say are not desirable. I protest against being asked to consider the items of the Tariff as likely to be affected by legislation without being informed what that legislation will be. The Minister says that he has not got the information now. I therefore ask if he will let us have it at an early date. </para>

                            <para>-Is the honorable member for South Sydney supporting the action of the Minister in asking the Committee to pass the Tariff, remembering that it will be affected by legislation yet to be proposed, without being told what that legislation will be? If the Commonwealth Parliament continues to legislate in this manner, it will suffer degradation, and will add to the ill-repute which it has acquired by passing ineffective legislation, the uselessness of which we must ourselves acknowledge. Measures which we have passed have proved ineffective, because when they were under consideration we were not given sufficient information to enable us to judge properly of their probable results. I am. afraid that the proposals of the Ministry are largely a placard - the sugar coating which, it is hoped, will induce the people to swallow the bitter pill of increased duties. Where Wages Boards and Arbitration Courts are effective now, they will continue to be effective, and nothing will be gained by the new legislation proposed by the Minister, but where no such effective machinery is now in operation, the proposals of the Ministry will be ineffective. That must be my opinion until the Treasurer gives us information showing it to be wrong. The benefits of the new protection are as illusive as many other Government promises have been, hut because it is promised, the Committee will agree to increased duties, and the cost of living will rise in Australia as it has risen in New Zealand. The Minister spoke of the New Zealand duties as being about21/2 per cent. higher than ours, and it is admitted that the cost of living has increased in New Zealand because of the Tariff. </para>

                            <para>- They are affirming only that house rent is contributory.I am afraid that we shall not arrive at an agreement by these contradictions. We are asked to impose heavy duties which will have to be borne principally by the working classes. It is not proposed to give the benefit to by far the larger proportion of the working classes, and where it is intended to give the benefit, it is merely nominal - a placard to induce the people to put up with these extraordinary duties. </para>

                        <para>.- I am in a most peculiar position, and one in which I think that very few honorable members are placed, in that during the electoral campaign I was not asked a single question on the fiscal issue. I would not have risen to-night, had it not been that very considerable misrepresentation has taken, place in New South Wales. As I did not refer to the subject during the electoral campaign, I think it only fair that I should now make a statement which will enable my constituents to understand the attitude I take up generally. First of all, it has been urged in that State that the Labour Party is responsible for the introduction of this Tariff. I believe that a greater measure of responsibility for the re-opening of the fiscal question, might be laid at the door of the leader of the Opposition, than at the door of the Labour Party. </para>

                        <para class="block">Shortly after the Coalition Government was formed on the basis of a fiscal truce, the Lyne-Isaacs wing of the Opposition sought to embarrass us by a clamour for relief for the artisans of Melbourne, who were alleged to be starving, and the industries of Melbourne, which were alleged to be ruined. . . . Our Government appointed a&#39; Tariff Commission to inquire into the work of the Tariff and its effect upon Australian industries. I courted the fullest investigation. I knew there might well be anomalies that called for redress and hardships that ought to be removed. . . . <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> did not object to the appointment of the Commission ; indeed, I conferred with him as to its composition. </para>

Later on the leader of the Opposition, knowing that on his recommendation the Tariff Commission had been appointed, appealed to the country, and said that the one supreme issue before the electors was that of anti-Socialism. He invited free-traders and protectionists to join with him in dishing the Labour Party, and in following out that idea he supported many protectionists throughout the Commonwealth. </para>

I believe that almost a majority of those who have been returned as anti-Socialists have given expression to socialistic views in the present Parliament. At the. general election the leader of the Opposition did not raise the fiscal question. He pretended to the people that it was sunk. Speaking at Geelong, he told the country he was going to sink the fiscal issue for ever. Yet what did he tell us here to-day? </para>

And&#39; now, when the day of disaster threatens us, instead of a fiery protest, we hear a whimper about the large number of protectionists in the House, and a pitiful cry to the more moderate of them to be as merciful as possible.

                    <para class="block">All this shows that the honorable member for East Sydney is, more than any one else, responsible for the re-opening of the Tariff question, and he and his supporters ought to be the last to fix the responsibility on others. Some complaint has been made as to the height of the duties under the proposed Tariff. The extent of the duties is, we all admit, due to the operation of the Braddon section, which places upon the Treasurer the obligation to raise four times the revenue that is required for Federal purposes. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Parramatta thought he &#39;had prevented me, and boasted of it in the House. The right honorable member for East Sydney was quite indignant that the honorable member for South Sydney should have said that he was in favour of perpetuating the Braddon section, although, at the elections, he made it one of the planks of his platform that he would support the continued operation of the section. No matter what side of the controversy is raised, the right honorable gentleman can claim that he has spoken to the contrary. If he is taken to task for assuming one attitude, he is able to point out that he took up the other attitude. Honorable members opposite, who are so loud in their professions of free-trade, refuse to adopt a policy of direct taxation, yet they are in favour of raising, through the Customs House, four times the revenue necessary for Federal purposes, and that means protection. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers,</inline> of New South Wales, who has had a good deal to say about the Federation, its alleged extravagance,, and the work of the Federal Parliament, has also had something to say on this question.

                        the Lyne Tariff will operate to the advantage of the city of Sydney. I admit that this newspaper previously contended that the Tariff would -operate to the disadvantage of Sydney, but that was when it was appealing to the working classes in that city. When it appealed to the country people, it tried to show that the Tariff would benefit the city of Sydney.

                    <para class="block">Sydney was largely benefited by the operation of the old Tariff. I find that from 1 901 to 1906 the number of factories in New South Wales was increased by 916, and the number of hands employed by 22,212. During last year, 1905-6, the increase in the number of factories in that State was 138, and in the number of employes 5,383. In Victoria during the same year the increase in the number of factories was 143, and in the number of employes 4,275. The increase in the number of factory employe&#39;s during last year was greater in New South Wales than in Victoria, and it would seem that under a protectionist Tariff New South Wales was benefited to a greater extent than Victoria. In Victoria the total number of factory hands employed is 67,544, and in New South Wales the number is 77,558, or over 10,000 in excess of the number in Victoria. Although at the recent elections I was not asked any questions, I issued a manifesto, in which I made a statement which, perhaps, was not very definite, but which was as follows - </para>

                        <para>All tariff proposals should be treated on their merits and as a business proposition, with a proviso that in the event of an article of manufacture being protected the workmen engaged in its production should be protected as well as the manufacturer. The fallacy that the manufacturer <inline font-style="italic">only</inline> reaped huge fortunes at the people&#39;s expense, and that a system of importation provided against huge incomes being made before goods reached the consumer, has been entirely exploded by the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney, Morning Herald,</inline> which showed recently that in Victoria, the home of manufacturers and protection, the importers enjoyed larger incomes than manufacturers; the latest figures from the income tax returns showing the taxation paid being :  - Importers, an average of&#163;1511s each; primary producers, &#163;15 6s. 6d. each; manufacturers,&#163;9 14s. 1d. each. It is obvious, therefore, that to assist importing rings by free-trade, or manufacturers&#39; rings by protection may be each detrimental to the people unless hedged about by such safeguards as will ensure an advantage to the community and workman as well as to the employer. The logic of the position is that if an industry has to be assisted or subsidized by the State, the State should conduct it, so that the whole people who provide the assistance should reap the benefit and not a few favoured individuals. If, <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> the other hand, an importing policy gives the undue advantage to the importer class, and importing rings stand between the consumer and his goods, the people through the State should co-operate to preserve to themselves the advantages of free importation. </para>

                        <para>The Labour platform proposes that the fiscal policy of Australia shall be settled by a. direct vote of the people themselves. Our intention is that this settlement shall be made speedily and decisively, free from the confusion and distraction of other issues. A Royal Commission is at present inquiring into the effects of the existing Tariff, and its report will doubtless be followed by a complete revision  of  duties by Parliament. This being accomplished, the question of confirming or rejecting the revised Tariff should be submitted to a referendum as soon as&#39; practicable, and thus insure freedom from Tariff alteration for a reasonable period. </para>

The protectionist on the other hand says that he desires to increase the wealth of the country by protection, through the Customs House, which is designed to encourage local manufactures. </para>

According to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coghlan&#39;s</inline> estimate, the average wealth of the community is . &#163;250 per head of the population, while according to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nash&#39;s</inline> estimate it is equal to &#163;1,000 per head of the population. The private wealth of New South Wales is put down at &#163;375,000,006. It is stated by the Statistician of New South Wales that one-half of that wealth is held by less than 3,000 individuals, and that nearly 20 per cent. of the owners of it reside outside the State, From this it would appear that the wealth of New South Wales per head of the population is about &#163;275. The fact that it is so great is held out to those in the old country as an inducement to come to Australia. Then again, last year the increase of wealth in New South Wales amounted to &#163;13,000,000, and I have no doubt that it was correspondingly great in all the States, since prosperity was general. </para>

We find that in New South Wales &#163;1,500,000 per annum is spent on charities and on pensions. It is also stated by the Registrar of Friendly Societies that the average citizen cannot make provision for sickness. </para>

Instead of trying to increase our wealth by free-trade or protection, we ought rather to turn our attention to a better distribution of the immense wealth which is already being produced. </para>

                            <para>- I do not say that at all. It is the duty of the Opposition to say anything, and generally to mean nothing. The Acting Prime Minister, in setting out his scheme, followed that outlined by the Labour Party to a large extent by stating that the Excise duty was to be imposed along with the Tariff, and that half the amount of duty was to be chargeable by a stamp duty upon those goods which were not manufactured under fair and reasonable conditions of labour, the exemption to be made to those who pay fair and reasonable rates. It is to be applied by affixing the Commonwealth trade mark, which is referred to in the Labour Party&#39;s scheme, to goods which are manufactured under those conditions. It will be most advantageous to Australia as a whole to know from the trade mark or union label - or whatever honorable members like to call it - affixed to goods, that those goods have been made under fair and reasonable conditions, and are not the product of sweated factories. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member need not be too eager in his presumptions. When the items are reached I shall take up the attitude which I think best. I do not feel called upon now to make a statement which the honorable member will make use of afterwards. A new tribunal is to be set up on lines similar to those suggested in the Labour Party&#39;s scheme, consisting of what is termed a Board of Excise. Three members are to be appointed, and the Acting Prime Minister states that the  Chairman  is to be a gentleman of legal attainments. Whilst, as a rule, it is better to keep the purely technical man off Boards which inquire into conditions of labour, I appreciate the value of having as  Chairman  of that Commission a highly-trained legal gentleman who would be able to dissect evidence. So long as he has the assistance of experts in the trades, I do not see that any disadvantage can ensue to the great masses of the working people. The powers which will be given to the Board have not been dealt with in detail, but the House will be able, when considering the question, to fix the detailed conditions under which the Board shall work. I hope that when that time comes we shall exclude lawyers from advocating the claims of either side before the Board, and also provide that there shall be no appeal from the Board&#39;s decision. In all these cases the decision of the Board which hears the evidence ought to be final. To enable those who are wealthy enough to pay for legal assistance to appeal from the decision of the Board which hears the evidence to some other tribunal, on purely technical grounds, always results disastrously to the working man. </para>

The honorable member for Echuca has referred to the constitutional aspect of the new protection proposals, and it is significant that the employers, who have plenty of representatives in this House, have already taken up a very firm attitude in that connexion. The Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> of 4th September, 1907, records that the Employers&#39; Council recently agreed to the following motion - </para>

This Council also considers that the passage of such illegal enactments is misleading to the public, and wishes to point out that it has already involved and must lead to further and almost endless litigation, thereby causing heavy law expenditure in order to prove their invalidity. </para>

Consequently it is idle for the honorable member to endeavour to impose upon me with a wolf and lamb story of that sort. What was done by somebody else upon this question is no concern of mine. The Employers&#39; Federation have indicated that they intend to test the validity of the new protection. Evidently they desire increased duties for their own benefit, and are disinclined to allow their operatives to participate in that benefit. If I did not think that we can bring this new protection scheme into operation I should not be in favour of protecting industries at all. </para>

                        <para>I look upon the action of my honorable friends below the gangway (the Labour Party) in support of the &#34;new protection &#34; as absolutely proper and sound. What is the basis upon which the people of Australia are willing to bear these burdens though the rates of. duty may be varied ? We know what has happened in America. We know the result of the high Tariff there. Any attempt to use this Tariff to sweat labour in order to inflate profits will be an outrage on the policy of protection as properly understood. </para>

                            <para>- The Labour Party deserves credit for having brought this matter to the front in practical politics. . . . Thousands of our poor people are consenting to this taxation, not to enable manufacturers to exploit them, but because they feel that they are encouraging the planting of seeds of industry which may grow into grand trees which will shelter the future labour of Australia. The ambition is a grand one. No one can help acknowledging that. </para>

If we are to have <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties on such goods as jewellery, I would rather see them imposed on the more expensive kinds than have heavy duties upon alarm clocks. I do not believe in a policy which would raise revenue from those who are least able to bear it. That is why I do not believe, as a general principle, in raising revenue through the Customs House.

                            <para>- It will be quite time enough for me to explain how I intend to vote upon any particular item when such item is before us. Generally speaking, if I do vote for protection, it will be upon lines which will enable the factories of Australia to compete on even terms with the cheap labour conditions of other countries. If we are going to maintain our White Australia policy and keep out the coloured races, we should go to the logical extent of that # principle. If we decide not to allow coloured men to come into Australia to undercut our producers, and to work under conditions to which we do not subscribe, we ought not to allow their goods to come in and compete with those produced by our workmen. In other words, if we stop the coloured man from coming into Australia, we should be prepared to give our own workmen sufficient protection to enable them to compete with the products of coloured workmen in other parts of the world. </para>

But I have a few remarks to make in regard to what was said by the Treasurer as to the method of dealing with the schedule. I- shall not offer anything in the nature of factious opposition to the proposals of- the Government, though, while I recognise that it is advisable that the Tariff should be settled as speedily as possible, I do not desire that items should be forced through without reasonable consideration. The Tariff covers a large multitude of items. </para>

                            <para>- To my mind, it covers a multitude of sins, too. It consists of hundreds of items, some of minor, and others of major, importance. In the latter class come the tobacco duties, to which . reference was made by the honorable member for Angas. We are informed that a number of tobacco factories which recently were in full work are now closed because of the uncertainty respecting the action of Parliament in reference to the Tariff, and that a large number of workmen are, therefore, out of employment. Another important item is the duty on wire netting. Wire netting is an article of vital necessity to many of our primary producers. So far as one can judge by the opinions already expressed, a! large number of honorable members, although pledged to protection, feel that they cannot support a duty upon it, so that probably the Committee will either strike off the duty or largely reduce it. In New South Wales a considerable quantity of imported wire netting, some of which, was brought in by the State Government, is now being withheld from use pending the decision of this Parliament in regard to the duty. But if a large number of growers are to save their crops, they must very speedily fence their holdings with wire netting. Importers and users alike are now in a state of great uncertainty by reason of our delay. Therefore, I join with the honorable member for Angas in urging upon the Government that these and other items of major importance shall be dealt with before items of minor importance. If the Government deal first with items of major importance, they will consider the best interests of the country, and will provide for the passing of the Tariff with the least friction possible. I am prepared to support the Treasurer in dealing with the Tariff in sections, so that when this House has passed a section it may be forwarded to the Senate for, consideration, with the result that the utmost expedition will be obtained, and this troublesome piece of legislation settled as speedily as possible. </para>

                            <para>- He also said that the Prime Minister favours the granting of a bounty in preference to the imposition of a duty, inasmuch as iron enters into the composition of so many articles that it would be undesirable at the present time to increase the cost of so universal a raw product. He proposed first of all to deal with it by way of a bonus. He has in his Tariff a division which is to be conditioned by a report from the Executive to Parliament, and I presume the passing of a resolution concerning it by Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- If I were asked to give an illustration of what wriggling meant as applied to politics I would certainly point any one to the performance of the honorable member for Cook. Do what we would we could not get him to declare himself to-night on the fiscal issue. I was surprised to hear him taunting any one about being on two sides of the fiscal fence. It came with very bad grace, and certainly with very great audacity, from him. There is another statement which he made to-night, and repeated with emphasis. He said that during the recent election he was not asked a question on the fiscal issue, nor had he made any statement on the fiscal question from any platform. If that was so, it is very remarkable that, immediately after his election, he took great pains to issue a circular to the Employers&#39; Federation in his electorate. </para>

Let me say that I never addressed a communication like that to the employers in my electorate. </para>

                            <para>- I am afraid I shall say there is something more damaging, and still decline to quote further. I listened to the Minister with a very great deal of interest while he unfolded his proposals in connexion with the new protection. After listening to him very intently, and with every desire to understand him,&#34; I am left in the dark as to many points about this professedly new policy. So far as I am able to understand the proposal, I can only say, at this juncture, that I shall decline to commit myself to any such proposal until it has been further explained, and we are able to understand it in all its bearings. </para>

                            <para>- Precisely, but that is quite another matter. The right honorable gentleman is in the same position as are other honorable members. He requires more light on the subject. I wish to say as emphatically as I am able, that while this Tariff is being proceeded with we should not only have particulars of the old protection set before us iri a schedule, but we should, at the same time, have before us particulars of the new protection also set out in a schedule. Each is supposed to be supplementary to. the other. As they have, been -outlined by the&#39; Acting Prime Minister, they represent the two halves&#39; of the same sphere. </para>

I wonder why these proposals could not have been stated ina schedule or laid before honorable members in the form of a Bill? </para>

                            <para>- The Acting Prime Minister has said to-day, only in a very much worse way, what the leader of the Labour Party said the other day. So far as I am &#39;able to apprehend the situation, the honorable gentleman has submitted a very imperfect and incomplete statement of the whole question. As the honorable member for. North Sydney said, this is evidently the sugar-coating of the protectionist pill which the government are asking the Committee and the country to swallow. All our medicine to-day is sugarcoated; but honorable members who take sugar-coated pills are aware that very often their effects last long after the sugar-coating is dissolved. I make the bold prediction that the sugar-coating of this new protection will have dissolved within a short time after the attempt is made to apply the policy practically to our industrial life. The more I consider the matter the more I fail to see how such a scheme can be workable so long as human nature is what it is. I therefore believe that when the sugar-coating has been dissolved it will be found that the old protection will remain with whatever it may have in store for the workers and consumers of the community. We have been told that an Excise Bill is to be brought down, and that those who do not subscribe to the new protection, those who do not pay fair wages, and sell their productions at a fair price-- </para>

                            <para>- The honorable gentleman has made a statement which I am sorry to say does not amount to much. I say that there will be the greatest possible difficulty in carrying out the proposals of the Government, either with regard to wages or with regard to prices. It is open to one of the difficulties pointed out in connexion with the last Excise proposals of the Government, and which was proved to be only too real, and is bound to follow in connexion with any proposals of this kind. When we set out to regulate prices we must be logical, reasonable and effective, and in controlling them there must be some stipulation as to the quality of the article on which a particular price is fixed. Take the case of harvesters. The Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Bill provided that the price should be reduced to &#163;65 per machine. </para>

                            <para>- It is not. There is a great difference in the value of machines sold in Australia to-day. It is said that the International Harvester Company make their machines at a much lower rate than do the Massey-Harris Company. </para>

                            <para>- Of course they do; that is the point I am making. There is nothing in the Act to prevent these people regulating the value of their machine to the price which the Government compel them to charge. Unless the Government by Statute guarantee to the consumer that the quality of the article will be maintained that must necessarily occur. All this talk about reducing prices is mere moonshine. The Government might compel manufacturers to sell at a cheaper price, but at the same time they would afford them an opportunity to make a cheaper machine, and give them a monopoly of the market in which to sell that machine. I should like to see that point met by the Acting Prime Minister in connexion with these new proposals, otherwise they will never be effective. I fear that when Ministers set out to try to regulate all the prices and all the labour of the community they will undertake a job the complexity of which would baffle a man much superior to any ever born upon this planet. I know of no three men who are wise enough and capacious enough to grasp, and control, and harmonize all the industrial occupations of the country, as well as to attend to all the ramifications of the distribution of the country. In dealing with the question of regulating prices one has only to look at a statement made by the Prime Minister himself when discussing this question at the Imperial Conference a few weeks ago. The honorable gentleman went on to say - and I quote these remarks because they are very appropriate to the matter now under consideration - </para>

                    <para>That is a very pregnant statement, showing that the Prime Minister, at least, has an appreciation of the difficulties which we have to face when we set out to control the prices to be charged in the various markets of Australia. Prices differ in every State, and for reasons which are peculiar to every State. I go further, and say they differ widely within every State and in almost every town ofeveryState. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger.</inline> - The fact that they differ will show that there is no combination. </para>

                            <para>- I am not speaking of a combination. The Government set out to do more than inquire whether or not a combination exists. They set out to guarantee to the consumers that they will not be charged excessive prices. They cannot do that unless they have such machinery as will enable them to follow the goods into every town and every hamlet of Australia, so as to know precisely what the consumer pays at the point where he parts with his cash. The honorable member knows that the cost of goods at the end of a railway line, or on a railway line, may be 20 per cent. less than it is 20 miles inland, whither the goods have to be conveyed by carriers. </para>

The honorable member, and, indeed, the Government, admit that, under their fair price proposition, all they need do is to make inquiries in the cities.

                            <para>- There is a great deal of difference between manufacturing goods and&#39; selling them in a wholesale way and retailing them to, the consumer. The Government give no guarantee to the consumer when they simply take care that the goods which leave the manufacturer&#39;s hands at a reasonable price shall be sold to the consumer at a reasonable price. One of the complaints most loudly uttered in connexion with this very Tariff is that prices are unduly inflated and raised to the consumer, and that neither the manufacturer nor the Tariff has anything whatever to do with that increase. Clearly, if the Government are to give any relief to the consumer, as they set out to do by this machinery, they will have to follow the goods to the point where he begins to take delivery in return for his cash. That is a task which cannot be compassed by any three men or 300 or 3,000 men throughout the length and breadth of Australia. Therefore this proposal will be a practical  nullity when an attempt is made to put it into force. </para>

                            <para>- Unfortunately or otherwise, there is the fact. For instance, it has been brought to light by the reports of the Tariff Commission that engineers in Western Australia receive an average weekly wage of 12s. more than is paid to engineers in Victoria. I suppose that there is a variance again between the wages received by the mechanic in Victoria and those paid to the mechanic in Tasmania. What are these three men to do with regard to fixing the general rates of wages all over Australia? While there is this huge difference in the wages paid for the same kind of work in Australia there is a common Tariff operating all over the Commonwealth. The man in Western Australia, who pays 12s. a week more than is paid in Victoria, will only have the same Tariff protection as is afforded to the man in Tasmania, who pays &#163;1 a week less than he does. </para>

                            <para>- It will be practically regulating prices when it suggests to this House that they are extortionate. I suppose it would indicate in its report the extent to which they are extortionate, and, therefore, would indicate unmistakably what is a fair price, and we should be bound to accept its recommendations. How otherwise can it be said that the Commission will act, if not in the direction of regulating prices ? It must do so. It cannot say that a price is extortionate unless it tells us to what extent it is extortionate. By so much as the price is extortionate, just so surely and accurately will it indicate to us what a fair price would be. Therefore, if we are to act upon the Commission&#39;s reports, it follows that it will actually, if not technically, fix prices. </para>

                            <para>- I say that they are practically insuperable. The scheme cannot be worked in any reasonable or practical way. It would take an army of employes, and then they would not do it. It would be the easiest thing in the world for the whole of the traders and manufacturers of the continent to evade the utmost watchfulness of any three men who are given the task of operating over so large an area. I, therefore, predict that this Excise business will break down the moment you come to apply it in practice over a continent such as ours. You cannot do it even in a State with all the means you have at your command. What is happening in Victoria? You cannot stop sweating. You minimize it, it may be, with infinite effort, infinite labour, infinite vigilance, with a great deal of goodwill and altruistic sentiment to boot, but there is still an abundance of it even in this State. </para>

                            <para>- I shall be very glad to consider any attempt which appears to toe of any practical use. I am criticising this scheme now, not for the purpose of destroying it, but to look at the actual facts of the situation as I see it. I decline to shut my eyes and swallow the scheme in the belief that by some mysterious process - some miracle - it is going to be made operative. The one thing that will be operative will be, not the new, but the old protection. I am afraid that the workers of this country will live a long while before any new protection comes home to them in their domestic conditions from any such proposals as are now put before us. Already we have done our very best in connexion with other matters to make some modicum of this scheme apply, and, after trying it, we have, to-night, to confess its failure. </para>

                            <para>- I know that it is not. But any proposal which means the constant hauling before the Courts throughout the length and. breadth of Australia of men who will not voluntarily obey these laws - I will not put it in that way at all - of men who may mistakenly break these laws, and plead that they cannot help themselves, is not going to be of much benefit to the workers of this country. I should far rather leave it to some- tribunal which would get away from lawyers and law courts, as of infinitely more benefit to the workers than those Statutes which can only be interpreted in a Court of law. So far, our experience of trying to protect the workers of Australia has not turned out as it should have done. As the honorable member for South Sydney knows, I supported willingly and cordially the Bill for the establishment of the Arbitration Court of New South Wales. I do not believe that it has been a success at all. </para>

                            <para>- No, but I am not quite sure that to-day, as a consequence of that Court, there is not a worse feeling between labour and capital than there was before. Instead of acting as a solvent of their difficulties, as we anticipated that it would, instead of harmonizing their differences in a rational way by means of arbitration, it is. no longer an Arbitration Court, but has been turned into a law court. There is very little equity and good conscience about the Court at all, but there is an abundance of law. </para>

                            <para>- No man criticised that Bill more legitimately and strongly that the present leader of the Opposition. He was the one man in that Parliament who pointed out that the very thing of all others that ought not to be done was to involve the workers of the country in the meshes of the law. I voted for the Bill in the belief that it would bring capital and labour together in harmonious relations. But instead of doing that, it has acted as a wedge between these two forces, and I say, without hesitation, that the feeling between them to-day is more rancorous and bitter than it was before the Court was set up. A man is blind who does not see that. </para>

                            <para>- I do. Underlying all these proposals for the application of the new protection by a machinery method - by the appointment of three Commissioners - there is the false assumption that conditions throughout Australia are fairly equal. That is precisely what we know they are not. Let honorable members think how widely they differ within every State, and let them reflect upon the multiplicity of local causes which render the fixing of prices and of labour conditions upon a fair basis beyond the ingenuity of any man, however capable he may be. </para>

We do not pay an officer in Victoria a different salary from that paid to the officer in New South Wales who discharges the same duties, although the cost of living may be dearer in one State than in the other. But to regulate the payment to our civil servants, we have had to unify conditions generally and broadly. That is what we cannot do in connexion with industrial matters under our Constitution. I have some other observations to make, but I shall reserve them until another occasion. We are, I understand, to have these proposals crystallized in a Bill or memorandum. Which is it to be ? </para>

                            <para>- I have not  a  remedy for all the ills of humanity. That is my trouble. Many of the remedies advocated by the honorable member are quack remedies. This is being proved the further that they are tested. I venture the fear that the . latest proposals of the Government will prove a quack remedy. However, they will serve their purpose in assisting to get this Tariff through Committee, with the support of honorable members who say that they would not support it if it were not accompanied by some such proposals. I have every desire to help the workers of this country in any way that may be open to them. To those who laugh and jeer, I wish to say that the answer to all their jeering and laughing is the record behind me. </para>

                            <para>- I venture to say that I have done more for the workers of Australia than the honorable member will do if he lives to be a hundred years of age. There is one thing, however, that I have never attempted. I have never tried to humbug them with will-o&#39;-the-wisp fantasies such as are proclaimed from the housetops to-day to be a remedy for all their industrial ills. I shall say no more. I do not see my way to give my adhesion to the principles of the new protection until they have been placed in a concrete form before us, and until we are able to get to close grips with the proposals of the Ministry. I certainly cannot agree with proposals which have been made so vaguely by the Treasurer to-day, and as to which there does not appear to be any sound basis. </para>
