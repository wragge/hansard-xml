            <para>The contract between the Commonwealth and Messrs. Burns, Philp and Company for a steam service to Papua is about to terminate. The existing service is an enlargement and extension of the Solomon Islands line, which, with one steamer, gave two-monthly trips to those Islands. At present both the Solomons and Papua have 21 trips per annum, with two steamers. The subsidy paid  for  the present service, exclusive of that paid on account of the Solomons, is &#163;1,500 per annum. Tenders were called for a new service for three years by advertisement, of which a copy is attached. Messrs. Bums, Philp and Co. were the only tenderers. They submit alternative offers as follow- </para>
            <para>Offer No. r.  -  To continue the present circular service from Sydney and Brisbane, <inline font-style="italic">vid</inline> the Solomons and Papua ports, to Cooktown and Cairns, by the <inline font-style="italic">Moresby</inline> &#39;(1,763 tons), and the <inline font-style="italic">Makambo</inline> (1,159 tons).

The <inline font-style="italic">Makambo</inline> is a  new  steamer &#34; specially built and properly equipped for tropical  Tunning  with electric light, refrigerators to carry frozen cargo, amidship  deck  cabins,  And  all conveniences.&#34; It is proposed, if this offer is accepted, &#34;to equipthe <inline font-style="italic">Moresby</inline> with refrigerated space, electric light, and other improvements, thus providing a thoroughly up-to-date ocean . service.&#34; For this service the company, ask &#163;4,500 for the first year ; &#163;4,000 for the second year ; and &#163;3,500 for the third, year. If Cooktown is substituted for &#39; Cairns as the Queensland terminal port, the subsidy asked for is &#163;3,750, &#163;3,250, and &#163;2,750 respectively. </para>

            <para>The service by the existing route has beer* found quite satisfactory to all parties, and in my opinion it would be a matter for regret now that interest in Papuan development showssigns of  Teal  progress, to abandon it in favour of an inferior service with a smaller steamer. I do not see, however, that the advantages of retaining Cairns as the Queensland&#39; terminal port are worth an additional subsidy of &#163;750- per annum, as the company undertake to maintain the connexion at Cooktown with the vessels of the Australasian United Steam Navigationcoastal service. If it is decided to adopt thecircular service, I recommend the substitution of Cooktown for Cairns as the Queensland ter  minal  port. The company submit a schedule of rates and fares which, if the circular serviceis adopted, &#39;might be amended by reducing the rates to Woodlark Island to those in force to Samarai. The matter is submitted for directions. </para>

There is no telephone exchange in Carlton, Fitzroy, Collingwood, Richmond, and Northcote, telephone subscribers in those districts having to pay extra mileage rates. The honorable member for Dalley pointed out last night that subscribers in Camberwell pay extra rates, while those in Canterbury, a suburb still further from Melbourne, do not. </para>

              <para>- I suppose that we shall have to be satisfied with the promise that reforms will be carried out in the near future. Of course, the PostmasterGeneral has not been long enough in charge of the Department to make changes. The injustice of which I speak exists in numerous localities. The charge for telephones should be uniform over a certain area, say within 10 miles of the city, or some system should be adopted under which it would not be possible to favour certain localities. Persons at Richmond are not likely to apply for telephones for their private houses when they know that they will be charged  &#163;8  or  &#163;9  for them, although Hawthorn subscribers pay only  &#163;5.  It is penalizing certain districts, and I trust that the Postmaster-General will look into the matter. Evidently New South Wales has far less to complain of than has Victoria. </para>

            <para>. - May I suggest to the honorable member who has just resumed his seat that he will do well to confine his attention to safeguarding the interests of his own State, and to refrain from instituting comparisons between Victoria and New South Wales. Evidently he does not know much about the latter State, otherwise he would not have made the remark with which he concluded his speech. Both the honorable member and myself have a common cause of complaint - a complaint founded upon a grave injustice. My complaint is that the ex-Postmaster-General is responsible for the difficulty which now exists, in that he abolished a system which had worked well for many years. I do not propose to deal with this question at any length. Last night the ex-Postmaster-General made some most absurd statements. When one sets out to make a &#34;stump &#34; speech, I believe that it is proper that his statements should, as far as possible, be in the inverted order, and, true to tradition, the exPostmasterGeneral last evening delivered a &#34; stump &#34; oration which had little reference to the question under consideration, and in -which his statements were turned topsy-turvy. He asked, &#34; What about the men who have 6 or 7 miles of wire? Ought not they to pay more than the man who has only 2 or 3 miles of wire ? &#39; &#39; What the honorable gentleman has recently done is to emphasize that very difficulty. My whole complaint is that subscribers who receive least line accommodation, are paying the increased charges, whilst those with most line accommodation are receiving the benefit conferred by the smaller rates. That is the injustice which his recent action has perpetuated. It is an injustice that we hope to have remedied. We have been promised by the Postmaster-General that something shall be done to remedy it. He has promised two things : first, that the citizens of the Commonwealth who use telephones shall, as far as possible, be treated equally; and, secondly, that he will secure this end by a fair and even&#34;handed apportionment of telephone facilities. </para>

It is too late in the day to do that. I complain that the present Postmaster-General is putting the rates up instead of down.

When I answered his criticism by putting the cold facts of the case before the Committee, he said that I made a &#34; stump &#34; speech. This afternoon he has referred to the framing of absurd regulations arid to &#34; shocking injustice.&#34; The regulations to which he refers were framed for the purpose of bringing the toll system into operation. We all recollect the &#34; stump &#34; speeches which he and many of his friends delivered prior to the initiation of that system. It is refreshing to know that, whilst they then condemned the toll system from one end of the country to the other, they now have; nothing to say in opposition to it. Instead of doing so, the honorable member calmly declared, in answer to a question! put by the honorable member for South Sydney, that he would welcome its universal application - a course which we have always advocated. </para>

              <para>- Then honorable members opposite had a most peculiar method of advocating it, seeing that they formed large deputations and waited upon the Postmaster-General of the day to protest against its initiation. I recollect that upon one occasion they endeavoured to get the leader of the Opposition to introduce a deputation upon this matter, and when they could not find him they requisitioned the services of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild.</inline> However, we can understand their action because at that time it was popular to scream against the inauguration of the toll system. It is a tribute to the officers of the Department who recommended the adoption of that system that, notwithstanding its denunciation by honorable members, the latter now recognise that it is no longer popular to scream against it. I do not wish to make what the honorable member for Parramatta terms a &#34;stump&#34; speech, but when he comes here, loses his temper, and indulges in strong language, it is only right that I should point out how inconsistent he is. He has spoken about the difference between the rate charged to a subscriber with seven miles of wire as compared with that charged to the individual who has only three miles of wire. The regulations framed by me were intended to insure that a man shall pay according to the service which he receives. </para>

              <para>- The. honorable member has said that a man with seven miles of wire can obtain a cheaper service than the individual with three miles of wire. He was most positive in making that declaration last night in respect of two persons resident in the same place and receiving the same service under the flat rate system. No doubt he has gone through his statement very carefully this morning, but he does not now wish to confirm it. If he could have discovered one weak spot in my declaration of last evening undoubtedly he would have been prepared to criticise it to-day. </para>

          <para class="block">I am glad that this discussion has had that effect. The toll system aims at placing every subscriber upon the same footing. It gives effect to the principle of payment . by results, and provides that a man shall pay in proportion to the service which he receives. Quite a number of flat rate subscribers in the city, who receive a service which is worth <inline font-style="italic">&#163;30</inline> per annum, pay for it only from <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline> to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;9</inline> per annum. The Postal Department has to be made to pay, and it is evident that the difference must be made up by the subscribers who do not get a large service. That is my answer to the honorable member for Parramatta. </para>

            <para>.- It affords me great instruction to listen to thespeeches which have been made upon thisquestion by the  deputy  leader of the Opposition and the ex-Postmaster-General. It is remarkable that whilst the lattercharges the former with advocating the extension of the toll system which he once condemned, the ex- Postmaster-General takes tt&#62; himself the credit of having inaugurated that system. </para>

              <para>- I cannot say whether it is correct or not, because the honorablemember for Parramatta usually denies, everything. In my opinion, no greater bungle has ever been made than that which has been perpetrated in connexion with the introduction of the toll telephonic system in the Commonwealth. It is not many years since that system formed a new subject in the discussion of the votes of this Department. The Postmaster-General of the Reid Administration actually knew so little about it that he inquired across the table of the House, &#34; What is the toll system?&#34; The introduction- . of that system marked the beginning; of a system of payment by results. After going very deeply into this question, and reviewing the history of telephonic development in older countries, I expressed the opinion by way of interjection - doubtless the Postmaster-General will remember the occasion - that the scale upon which it was proposed to base the toll rates was an unsatisfactory one. Prior to the introduction of the system in Australia the maximum number of calls permitted in any country was 750, annually, and fd. was charged for each additional call. In other instances a maximum of 600 calls was allowed, and id. was charged for each additional call. </para>

              <para>- -Yes. These were the most liberal cases that I can cite. The ex-Postmaster-General, however, declared that he intended to allow 750 calls annually as the maximum. One would- have thought that such was a generous offer. Further, he proposed that only &#163;d. should be charged for each additional callpractically half as much as is charged in other countries. Under these circumstances, one would have imagined that our subscribers were going to secure a service at exceedingly low rates. But we all &#39;know the hue and .cry which was raised when he proposed the system under which a&#60; maximum of 750 calls annually was allowed, with Jd. charge for each additional call. I blame the PostmasterGeneral for not exhibiting more courage upon that occasion, and for taking heed of the howl which was raised- </para>

              <para>- I do not think the  honorable member does know. If the exPostmasterGeneral had had backbone enough to face the metropolitan press, merchants and others, aird see to the interests of the general public, we should now have had a system which would be a credit to Australia; and we should have been enabled to give four times the telephone facilities, that :are now afforded in the country districts. Flat-rate subscribers pay only &#163;&#38; a year, and have 2,000 free calls, each of&#34; which, of course,&#39; means a message and a reply. Is that not a ridiculously cheap rate? </para>

              <para>- Perhaps not, but we ought to see that there is equitable administration of the Department. If the large users of the telephone are afforded facilities at low rates, it follows that we cannot afford to give telephonic conveniences to the scattered population in distant parts of the Commonwealth at fair rates. It was sheer cowardice on the part of the exPostmasterGeneral to extend the number of calls from 750 per year to 1,000 each half year; indeed, I never dreamt that a gentleman of his characteristics would have backed down to such a degree. Until the charges are more equitably apportioned, we shall not achieve the object which the telephonic branch of the service ought to have in view ; but it will be more difficult now to undo what the ex- </para>

              <para>- Possibly ; but it appears to me to be only an apology for a system. I hope the present PostmasterGeneral will see his way to equalise matters by reducing the number of calls to say, 1,000 per annum, and charging&#189;d. for every additional call, without that sliding scale which was adopted at the instigation of the metropolitan press, and those merchants and others who so influenced his predecessor. There is no doubt that the present Postmaster-General could make a name for himself &#39; if he grasped the nettle firmly, and adopted some such method as I have suggested, thereby releasing revenue for the purpose of affording telephonic facilities throughout the country. That is the only way now open to him to bring about that equality of administration which should have marked the initiation of the toll system. When I hear the exPostmasterGeneral talking about his courage, and about what he has done, I feel reluctant to express my opinion in the words which occur to me. He showed himself to be most weak when he had the opportunity of his life - to inaugurate a new and equitable system which would have proved of great benefit to the people of the whole of Australia. </para>

              <para>- The honorable gentleman is not talking like a Minister of the Crown, but like a nonentity. He has just assumed the position of PostmasterGeneral, and yet he presumes to know something of the service. All the honorable member knows about is hat making; he knows absolutely nothing about the Postal Department. If those in charge of this Department were business men, they would make provision for the future. There are three or four services which must expand with the population, and the Postal Department is one. Then, more money than is necessary is being spent in suburban places, where there is not likely to be any increase in population. The officers who make the suggestions are evidently influenced by some one against their own judgment. </para>

On the advice of those officers the Minister reads and signs minutes, and that is about all he knows and does. The additions to the Sydney Post Office are of a florid character, with magnificent and artistic stonework. We should have business accommodation rather than ornamentation; and the extensions ought to have been made long ago.

              <para>- I have seen the plans in connexion with the Sydney Post Office, just as I have seen the plans in connexion with the Melbourne office, and I know pretty well what is going on. When a design has once been completed, we must not spend money on ornamentation. Suburban offices should be suitable for the service of the districts. In a place that is stagnant and not likely to move for many years, it is a waste of hard cash to erect elaborate buildings. At Bondi, for instance, it is proposed to spend &#163;1,300, although that place is within two miles of a first-class post office. This is an insignificant place so far as business is concerned ; and, as I have indicated, most of the population are within a short distance of Randwick. At Katoomba it is proposed to spend &#163;1,000 on a post office, although this place is practically forsaken during all but about three months of the year. I find that it is proposed to expend &#163;2,000 in erecting a post-office at Lithgow, a town that is absolutely dead. Its position to-day is exactly what it was about five years ago. </para>

              <para>- But for the railway officials the town would be absolutely empty. When I referred to another item relating to a town in; the mountains, the honorable member for the district objected so strongly that I thought it was well to mention this item, although I was not altogether in earnest in my references to it. I wish now to say something about the telephone service. The ex-Postmaster-General has described that of New South Wales as being satisfactory. I contend that it is a disgrace to the Commonwealth. Any one who has travelled will admit that he has not met with a more inefficient or unsatisfactory service. The ex- Postmaster-General said that he had been charged by the  deputy  leader of the Opposition with being a mere figure-head to that Department. It appears that the honorable member said nothing of the sort, but I have- no hesitation in so describing the honorable gentleman. He took exception to strictures passed upon the administration of Departments by officers, but I should like to know whether we have not a right to refer to any case of inefficiency. The responsibility of Ministers has been transferred, to some extent, to the Public Service Commissioner, but, at the same time, we surely have a right to comment upon the inefficiency of any of the services, of the Commonwealth. Are we at all times to blame the Commissioner? I think not. The ex- PostmasterGeneral should have made a minute recommending that a highly competent man of wide experience should be brought to Australia to reconstruct our telephonic and telegraphic services. </para>

              <para>- Because we need a man of experience, and to get one we must go to the United States of America. The telephone service of the Sandwich Islands is far ahead of that of New South Wales, arid, even some years ago, was in advance of It. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sydney</inline> Smith took office as PostmasterGeneral, he suggested to his officers directions in which improvements might be made, but on every hand he was opposed by the electricians of the Department, and as soon as he retired they returned to their former inadequate system. The Minister who succeeded him adopted the system which they dictated, and it is for that reason that I assert that, whilst PostmasterGeneral, the honorable member for EdenMonaro, was nothing but a figure-head. The telephone service is far behind the times. That of Adelaide is a tin-pot one. It is impossible to communicate with a subscriber there without giving his name to the officer at the exchange, and it is only a few months since the penny-in-the-slot system was introduced there. If we had an up-to-date officer it would not be long before we should have, in all probability, a system second to none. Some of our subscribers are provided with a maximum service at a minimum cost. The business of our exchanges is congested by a few people. Large business firms are constantly connected with the exchange, and  for a very small payment are enjoying a service that is worth thousands of pounds. Compared with such subscribers, those who have telephones only in their own homes pay far more than they ought to do. This is a question, not of the large man being attacked by the small man, but of every subscriber being called upon to pay in proportion to the service rendered by the Department. We shall not have a satisfactory system until we have at the head of the telephone service an officer capable of reorganizing it. Then again we find that the old practice of allowing persons to own their own telephones has not yet been abolished. Such&#39; subscribers enjoy an unlimited service at a peppercorn rental. The; system should have been abolished years ago, and, if necessary, in the interests of the general body of subscribers, these persons should be bought out. The exPostmasterGeneral has declared that the Opposition were always opposed to the toll system. I have always been in favour of it, believing that a man should pay in proportion to the service he receives. Under the flat system, that is not done. Even if it be true that the leader of the Opposition refused to introduce a certain deputation to the Minister, that is no evidence of his opposition to the request which the deputation had to make. It is a well understood rule that a member of Parliament shall introduce to a Minister any deputation from his district which asks him to do so. It does not necessarily follow that an honorable member, simply because he introduces a deputation to a Minister, approves of its object. I find that, according to a statement maderecently by the PostmasterGeneral, the heads of his Department have gone back upon their reports as to the inefficiency of the service and the shortage of officers. </para>

              <para>- No; but we have a responsible Minister talking like a child. If the officer in question submitted an exaggerated report to the Minister he should have been suspended. He had before him books showing the extent of overtime worked by men in the service. All these facts go to show how incompetent the Postmaster-General is. If officers are at liberty to send in reports which are exaggerated, or, in other words, untrue, the service must be in a deplorable state. </para>

              <para>- I do not think there can be any doubt as to the&#34; correctness of the reports. The speech made during the Budget debate by the honorable member for Gwydir should have been answered by the Minister. When an honorable member makes a straightforward statement in regard to the working of a Department, and in support of it quotes from the reports of responsible officers, the Ministerial head of that Department should either be prepared to make a satisfactory explanation or to resign. It seems that we have reached a stage in the history of the Commonwealth when Ministers may be permitted to make random statements and to draw salaries in respect of offices which they are quite incapable of filling. Something has been said by the PostmasterGeneral with regard to the unjust treatment of officers. This Parliament has never done any injustice to an officer of the Public Service. It is the Minister at the head of the Department in which such a complaint is raised who must accept the responsibility. The Ministerial head of a Departmentis expected to provide increased assistance for a growing service. The Public Service Commissioner cannot make more appointments unless the funds necessary for the payment of additional officers are provided. All these facts go to show how incompetent are the men at the head of affairs to discharge the duties expected of them. </para>

            <para>.- I trust that the Postmaster-General is taking a note of the criticism of his Department, for I can assure him that there is an  opportunity for him to effect great improvements in it. I brought before the House the inequitable charges imposed for the use of the telephone service in Adelaide and its suburbs. Places six miles from Adelaide have a cheaper telephone service than more populous districts close to the city. Telephone subscribers in Norwood, Unley, St. Peters, and Kenttown, all thickly populated centres,&#39; have to pay  &#163;3  more per annum than subscribers in Glenelg, Port Adelaide, and other districts further removed, where the population is not so dense, and, presumably, &#39;the cost of the service greater. There is no excuse for continuing these inequalities. &#39; I admit that the present system is not the fault of this Ministry, but has grown up under a number of Governments. Still, although I called attention to the South Australian inequalities three months ago, and was told that steps were being taken to remedy them, nothing has yet been done, and I see no proposal on the Estimates for new exchanges. </para>

              <para>- I do not think that the Cabinet is entitled to withhold improvements and conveniences which the public require. Parliament would be quite prepared to vote whatever money is necessary for a proper telephone system. As a matter of fact, it would not cost much to remove the inequalities which have been complained of, and which should not be allowed to continue a day longer than is necessary. The honorable member for Yarra was taken to task for having referred to the condition of things in New South Wales, but, under the circumstances, his remarks were perfectly fair, and by no means parochial. According to the Estimates, provision is being made for at least fourteen new exchanges in that State. </para>

              <para>- Most of the ornate work on the Sydney General Post Office was carried out long before there was any Federal Parliament. But complaints have been general for a long time past about the inadequate accommodation provided there. This has caused serious trouble to those responsible for the despatch of business. The opinion has also got abroad that for many years the persons employed in that office have been continuously sweated, from the heads of departments right through the service, and I have every reason to believe that this opinion is well founded. But I understand that it has been determined to relieve the overwork of the . officials there, giving them much- needed assistanceby increasing the staff. Inlooking through the Estimates I have noticed that very large sums are set down for buildings in comparatively out of the way places. For instance, we are asked to vote &#163;400 towards the cost of erecting a post office at Bellingen. The total cost of the work is to be &#163;900, a very large sum to be spent on so small a place. </para>

              <para>- I do not object to necessary expenditure, but in connexion with items such as that to which I am referring we should have full information as to the population to be served. Some justification for proposals of this kind should be put before us. If we are not properly informed in regard to them, I, for one, shall feel inclined to move reductionsin many cases. A large sum is proposed for the erection of a post office at Coff&#39;s Harbour, a very small place. We should set our faces against lavish expenditure in out of the way places. Instead of erecting large and costly buildings such as are bigger than the actual or probable immediate requirements of districts demand, we should confine ourselves to providing what will meet the necessities of the situation. In regulating this expenditure we could always have an eye to future development, and see that the designs are such as to permit of the extension of these buildings in conformity with the ultimate plans. I notice, too, that &#163;700 has been put upon the Estimates for the erection of a postoffice at Culcairn,&#163;400 towards the erection of a similar office at Curlewis - the total cost of the building is to be &#163;800 - &#163;750 for a post-office at Kyogle,&#163;400 towards the erection of a post-office at Tingha, the total cost of which is to be &#163;800, and &#163;470 for a similar office at Kurri Kurri. </para>

              <para>- Doubtless the honorable member will be able to give the Committee some information in regard to that undertaking. A sum of &#163;749 has also been provided for the erection of a postoffice at Mullumbimby. I call attention to these items because of the extreme difficulty which I have experienced in securing the expenditure of small sums upon admittedly necessary postal works. As a mat ter of fact, I had to go through all sorts of formalities to get acoat of paint put upon a post-office in my own district. Before that work was actually undertaken an officer had to inspect the building, and to report upon it, which, of course, is proper - but the matter was then hung up for months. When I see large sums provided upon the Estimates for the erection of new buildings, I am impelled to ask why it is that such a marked disinclination is evinced to the expenditure of small sums upon necessary repairs. Another example of the extreme parsimony sometimes displayed was afforded by the refusal of the Department to purchase from a retiring postmaster a bath-heater which he had installed at his own expense whenin charge of the office. Little acts of parsimony of that kind are irritating in themselves, and naturally provoke one to inquire why such penuriousness should be exhibited upon the one hand and such lavishness upon the other. Some time since complaints were made of the inadequacy of the living accommodation provided at the St. Peter&#39;s post-office. I visited that office with a view to making a personal inspection. I found that a bedroom was provided which was barely large enough to permit of a single bedstead being erected, and that, to insure a supply of light and air it was necessary that the door communicating with another and by no means large room should be kept open. </para>

              <para>- Yes. At the present time the officer in charge of that postoffice is a married man with a family. No proper provision has been made for housing the members of his family, and no disposition has been exhibited by the Government to improve the living accommodation. A little time ago the authorities did build outside the house a small weatherboard shed intended to serve the purpose of a bedroom, but it was a mere shed, and unfit for such a use. I mention these matters merely with a view to show the parsimony which is exhibited in some cases as compared with the extravagance which is shown in others. I hope that the PostmasterGeneral will order an officer to make an inspection of the St. Peter&#39;s post-office  with a view to providing increased accommodation for the postmaster and his family. </para>

              <para>- The Acting Prime Minister will not induce me to. shorten my speech by interjections of that sort. I ami not going to be bullied by him. I repeat that the establishment of a telephone exchange ought not to be the subject of a hard and fast regulation. Notwithstanding . that an exchange may exist within three miles of any centre, I say that the population of that centre may justify the erection of another exchange. The present arbitrary regulation, if continued, will be provocative of a great deal of trouble in the future. I was under the impression that the object of the Department was to popularize the telephone, but that result is not likely to be achieved if obstacles are placed in the way of residents in populous centres securing the establishment of .local exchanges. </para>

              <para>- I think, that it is. Certainly its policy is in opposition to alt . recognised commercial principles. I may add that I have unsuccessfully attempted to procure the establishment of a telephone bureau at Como, which is a favourite resort of week-end holiday makers, and of picnickers generally. At present it_ is impossible to transmit a telephone message from that place to Sydney, which is only 13 miles distant. The railway authorities of New South Wales have offered to provide the necessary accommodation for -a telephone bureau at the Como railway station. Then there is another busy centre upon George&#39;s River, between Tom  Ugly&#39;s.  Point and Sylvania. An immense traffic passes over this particular spot every day in the year - indeed, at week-ends the traffic becomes so congested that persons frequently have to wait an hour for the punt to take them across to the other sideBut, although there is a post-office at Sylvania, it is impossible to get a telephone installed there, notwithstanding that the place is visited by tens of thousands of persons every year; </para>

          <para class="block">I am informed that the cause of the delay is the scarcity of instruments ; but, although, that excuse might be reasonable in the beginning, it cannot last for ever. When the heads of the Department know that the telephone is likely to come into general use in the near future, they should adopt the ordinary commercial principle of providing for any increase of business, and so provide the facilities so often promised by the ex-Postmaster-General. I do not blame the ex-Postmaster-General so much, because, while he was in charge of the Department, he made great strides in the direction of reform. There is, however, too much of a tendency to allow officers torun the Department, owing to the. fact, I suppose, that Ministers do not take the trouble to inform themselves. Ministers are very prone to rely too much on reports from their officers, although I have known some cases in which such reports have been absolutely unreliable, even to the extent of misstatements of fact. For example, in reference to Miranda, where telephonic facilities were required, the reports of the inspecting officers were of such a dolorific nature that the Minister regarded himself as taking tremendous risks when he finally met the wishes of the residents. </para>

              <para>- That is so, but he has not always acted up to those promises. In the Miranda case I got the telephone because I was prepared to back my opinion against the official&#39;s report by a personal guarantee to make up any financial loss on the line. As a matter of fact, the returns from the telephone at this place are eminently satisfactory from every point of view. I mention this fact only to show that it is not advisable for Ministers always to rely too much on the reports of officers ; but that, where an honorable member shows reasonable grounds for telephone extension, the Minister should weigh those grounds and form an independent judgment, and, when possible, pay a visit to the locality. The Progress Association of San Souci and Sandringham sent a request to the Minister for improved postal and telegraphic facilities several weeks ago, hut up to the present no definite reply has been received. I wrote the other day reminding the Department that a request had been sent in, and asking that the in quiry might be expedited. I believe that the Minister has asked to have a report prepared assoon as possible; but I take this opportunity to suggest that the Department must be undermanned, having regard to the great delay in obtaining a reply from it </para>

            <para>.- We are asked to vote a very large sum of money, and we ought to have some information as to how it is to be used. The sum immediately under consideration is &#163;34,246, but the sum ultimately involved is much larger. I notice that &#163;40,000 is to be spent on the General Post Office, Sydney, and we are now asked to vote &#163;7,000 of that sum. This is a matter on which we require some enlightenment, because, in my opinion, service would be rendered to the country if the post-office in Sydney were burnt down and a new one erected in its place. </para>

              <para>- All I mean is that the present structure is so out of date that it would be really much better if it were thoroughly renovated. The offices of any up-to-date business firm are so constructed that the whole of those employed are under a certain amount of supervision by their superiors; but in the General Post Office, Sydney, each individual officer appears tohave a carefully closed room allotted to him. There is, first of all, the head of the Department, in a very handsome office, and each officer apparently works in a little cellular compartment. The whole of the front of the building, which is well lighted by a series of windows, is devoted to a long passage ; and I think the whole place ought to be reorganized structurally. </para>

              <para>- No. but I profess to have a certain modicum of common sense ; and I am entitled to express an opinion on a matter common to any man of  ordinary observation. If the Treasurer would only explain his Estimates and other proposals in a proper way, a good deal of speech-making and inquiry would be saved. I do not take exception to the amount proposed to be expended, because, after all, it is most necessary that our post-offices should be made convenient. I do take exception, however, to the elaborate  structures  which are provided in many of the country districts, where money, which ought to be devoted to providing facilities for the people, is spent in outside ornamentation. For example, at a place called Kurri Kurri we find that the postmaster, with his family of four or five, has two small rooms in which to live. I do not think that the Department does justice to country districts. In various outlying places, where the important industry of dairyfarming is chiefly carried on, there are no telephonic facilities, and I may say, in illustration, that time after time a request has been made in, vain for such facilities at Underbank and another similar place. It - would appear that the inspectors, who have to cover enormous stretches of country, areoverworked, and that this fact supplies the reason for the delay. If money has to be spent, I  think  the number of inspectors might be increased. The exPostmasterGeneral told me that he quite recognised that the Department was suffering a loss owing to some leakage, which he proposed to stop ; but, unfortunately, the honorable gentleman has moved up a step, and his successor, the present Postmaster-General, is so busy with protectionist propaganda, that he really has no time to devote to the work of his office. I do not think that the present Postmaster-General is likely to follow the advanced policy of his predecessor, so  long as he bestows- so much of his time on furthering the protectionist movement. </para>

              <para>- If the honorable member is such a narrow-minded man, &#39; I am very sorry that he holds office as PostmasterGeneral. Is it not his duty to conduct the Department on commercial lines? Does he propose to conduct it on purely sectarian lines? Does he not know that it is his duty if possible to make the Department pay and to see that it provides for the convenience of the public ? I maintain that very many people go to hotels not to purchase a drink but to obtain meals, or to secure board and residence, and I fail to see why a telephone service should not be provided in such places for their use. If we were to place on the Estimates a sum to permit the Postmaster-General and others of the same ilk to travel in order to enlarge their ideas we should do well. I wish now to refer to the practice adopted in providing silent bureaux for country offices. When it is proposed to erect one of these bureaux reports travel backwards and forwards between the head office and the country office - I cannot say whether ornot they are sent on to Melbourne to be indorsed by the Secretary of the Central administration - and after a considerable delay a box is sent along. Instead of instructing a local man to carry out the work tenders are invited, and sometimes it is discovered when the box is delivered that it is too large to pass through the doorway. It has then to be altered or the doorway has to be enlarged, unless the box is to remain on the verandah of the post office. </para>

              <para>- If I remember rightly, one of these boxes was sent up to the post office at Kurri Kurri, and as it was too large to go through the doorway of the post office it had to stand in the passage. I am grieved at the attitude of the Post master-General with regard to the introduction of penny-in-the-slot telephones in hotels. By refusing to adopt this system he will lose a large amount of revenue which might well be spent in raising the salaries of some of the unfortunate clerks who, owing to the parsimony of the Department, are now being overworked. I know of cases where these unfortunate officers have deductions made from their salaries in respect of rent for premises owned by the Department when they are really acting as caretakers of them. Over and over again I have made representations to the Department in regard to these matters, but I invariably meet with a rebuff, and it seems to me that the sooner the Treasury benches are occupied by men who are prepared to listen to reasonable requests the better. </para>

            <para>. - I hope that the debate on these small items will now be brought to a close, although I admit that it is only reasonable that honorable members should desire to know something of the intentions of the Department in regard to the extensive alterations to be made at the Sydney General Post Office. The item of &#163;7,000 appearing on the Estimates is to provide for alterations, the total cost of which will be &#163;40,000. More floor space is urgently required, and alterations to secure the same, in the shape of remodelling the interior of the building, are intended to be undertaken. Walls and masonry piers at present occupy a great deal of space, which by their removal, will be available for official work. </para>

              <para>- Quite so. For an expenditure of &#163;40,000 the interior of the building is to be remodelled. The work must be a gradual one, and I think that most honorable members who have referred to the item largely agree with the proposal. </para>

              <para>- The item on the Estimates in question is to be devoted to the alterations I have just indicated. It will readily be recognised that we could not attempt to expend the whole amount at once, since the making of these alterations must necessarily be a gradual process. As soon as one part of the building has been remodelled, another part, where the officers are now working, can be relieved, and the alterations may be proceeded with. </para>

              <para>- And also Hoffnung&#39;s premises. The matter has not yet been brought to a head, but very likely there will be a proposition to extend the building in that direction. The question is one that cannot now be discussed. We are fully aware of the necessity for increasing the accommodation at the General, Post Office, Sydney, and I hope there will be no further objection to the item. Reference has been made to several other items relating to the PostmasterGeneral&#39;s Department, and I wish to place before honorable members the information I have in regard to them. In the first place, a contract for the erection of the Alstonville Post Office is in progress, and provision is made on the Estimates for carrying out the work. A tender is being accepted for the erection of the Bangalow Post Office, and the work will probably be. proceeded with almost immediately. As to the item of &#163;400 towards the cost of the Bellingen Post Office, I may say that The total cost is exjilted to be &#163;900. The revenue of the post-office is nearly &#163;2,000. I have visited Bellingen on many occasions, and knew that it is situated in one of the richest parts of the north coast country. The population is rapidly increasing. The railway line which is now being constructed from Newcastle to Grafton will traverse part of the district, and cause it to be still more productive and valuable. The lease of the present premises expires on 30th June, 1908., and in order to provide for increased postal business, the inspector for the district recommended the acquisition of a portion of the police reserve site in the main street, and the erection thereon of a building for postal purposes, at a cost, as I have said, of &#163;900. This recommendation was concurred in by the Postmaster-General on 2nd May, 1907. The population of Bondi, where it is proposed to erect a post-office at a cost of &#163;1,300, is 3,000. The site is Commonwealth property. The premises in which business is at pre1*&#34;being transacted are leased at a rental of &#163;28 5s. per annum. There is no residence attached to the present building, and it is proposed to erect a new brick building to afford adequate accommodation for the public and officials. The total cost of the Canbelego Post Office will be &#163;800. The town has a population of 600. The revenue is &#163;892. The postal business at this place is at present conducted by a non-official postmaster, in premises which are represented to be inconvenient,, and it is recommended that a building be erected on a site previously reserved for postal purposes by the State Government. The &#39;estimated cost of the Coffs Harbor post-office is &#163;900. The present rented premises are inadequate, and inconveniently situated, and are leased for a rental of &#163;33 a year. The proposed site of the new building is the property of the Government of New South Wales. The new Culcairn postoffice will cost &#163;700, and is about the only new building to be erected in my electorate. For some time past private persons, one on each side of the railway, have wanted the building to be placed on their property, but it was discovered about six months ago that there .is a police reserve almost adjoining the line, and the Commonwealth has arranged to buy part of it for about &#163;25, and the post-office will be placed on that land. </para>

              <para>- It ought to be doneThere are certain places, such as telegraph repeating stations, where accommodation relatively larger than that needed in other districts with similar (populations is required; but, generally speaking, the expenditure on post-offices should bear a relation to the revenue received from the_ districts in which they are situated. I&#34; feel positive that there are many contract offices in Victoria whose revenue is greater than that of districts elsewhere in which official post-offices have been erected. I have always done my best to bring about the substitution of official for contract postoffices, but in some cases the Department has gone to the other extreme by erecting buildings much more costly and elaborate than are required. We should have full information in regard to every district in which any large expenditure is contemplated. We are asked to vote &#163;7,000 towards the cost of alterations at the General Post Office, Sydney, and are informed in a foot-note, printed in very small type, that the total cost of these alterations will be &#163;40,000.

            <para>.- The experience under State administration was that, if one centre got a good post-office, adjoining centres wanted equally large buildings, whether the volume of work there was large or small. Under Commonwealth administration, however, since works have now to be constructed out of revenue, and not out of loan moneys, an attempt has had to be made to make new buildings conform, as nearly as possible, to the requirements of the districts in which they are situated. </para>

              <para>- Even professional men occasionally make errors.. When a district has a postal revenue of &#163;300 or &#163;400, we need not be afraid of spending &#163;900 to build a post-office there. The Commonwealth could hardly rent a suitable building for less than &#163;1 a week, which, at the rate at which- we could borrow money, would be more than the interest on the sum I have named. Moreover, we must feel confident in the prosperity of Australia, and it is easily seen that the acquirement of property by the Commonwealth at reasonable rates will be to the advantage of the public. I am with those who think that the fullest information should be given in regard to proposals for expenditure, and have advocated what is the rule in some of the State Parliaments, that a column should be provided in the Estimates for figures showing the total sum to be expended on any new work, as well as the amount required for the year. </para>

            <para>.- This debate must have convinced the PostmasterGeneral that a. good deal of dissatisfaction exists in regard to the management of the Department over which he presides. I think that the dilatoriness is due not so much to any want of attention on the &#34;part of its officers as to the fact that those officers have been, and still are, very much overworked. To dwell upon this aspect of the matter can serve no useful purpose, because I believe that the Postmaster-General himself recognises the existence of the evil to which I refer, and intends to do what he can to remedy it. The grievances which have been ventilated this afternoon in regard to the telephone department arise from a similar cause. They are not due so much to any want of appreciation by the Department of the necessities of the various districts as to bungling in the ordering of supplies. I should not have risen if it had not been for certain remarks made by honorable members upon this side of the Chamber. It seems to me that the honorable member for Lang displayed a lack of knowledge when he questioned items of expenditure in connexion with post-offices at Bellingen, Kurri Kurri, and Coffs Harbor. Bellingen, I may inform the &#39; Committee, is the centre of the rapidly growing northern rivers district of New South Wales. Coffs Harbor is a similar centre, and in these centres a marvellous growth of population has taken place during the past five years, owing to the development of the dairying industry. We all know that immense coal fields have been opened up at Kurri Kurri, as the result of which a township has been formed within the. past three years. My surprise is that a post-office has not been erected there before. The progress of that centre reminds me of the rapid growth of a place in my own electorate. I refer to Wolgan - where the population has incensed during the past eighteen months by perhaps 1,500, and where great difficulty was experienced in inducing the authorities to establish a postoffice. It was only when the matter became almost a scandal that they consented to the establishment of an office there. It seems to me that Kurri Kurri occupies a somewhat similar position. The honorable member for Robertson has questioned the propriety of the erection of new offices at Lithgow and Katoomba. Everybody throughout the Commonwealth has rejoiced over the establishment of iron works at Lithgow. We all recognise that in consequence of the rapid increase in the output of coal, Lithgow has progressed by leaps and bounds. Its population is increasing at the rate of about 1,000 a year. The small building which does duty for a post-office in the township is absolutely unsuited to the purpose for which it is being used. The Acting Prime Minister has quoted figures relating to the revenue derived by that office. I have some statistics showing its total receipts - which, of course, is a somewhat different matter from revenue - for six months. These figures show that during the first half of the present year the Lithgow post-office received &#163;850 for Excise stamps, &#163;2,529 for postage stamps, or a total&#39; of ^3)379. which is equivalent to &#163;6,758 per annum. </para>

              <para>- During the same halfyear &#163;5,821 worth of postal notes were disposed of. Of course, the revenue derived from the sale of these notes would be based upon the poundage rate. The post-office at Lithgow also derived a revenue of &#163;255 from money orders last year, and that amount will be considerably increased during the current year. Between June and December, 1905, the total amount received from the sale of stamps was &#163;067,. which is equivalent to about&#163;1,900 annually, showingan increase in eighteen months at the rate of approximately &#163;3,158 per annum on the sale of postage stamps alone. It will be seen, therefore, that the revenue is increasing by leaps and bounds. The town is provided with an all-night telephone service, and the whole of the postal, telegraphic, and telephonic work has to be carried out in an office which is not large enough to permit of the swinging of the proverbial cat. The telephone cannot be used with any degree of privacy. One cannot write out an application for a money order without other persons in the office being in a, position to read what one is doing. I understand that some temporary repairs are being effected with a view to improve the existing conditions, but it will be utterly impossible to continue the work which has to be done there in the present office. Moreover, the population of Lithgow is spreading towards Eskbank, and the post-office is situated on the western boundary of the town. The inspector who has reported upon the matter has, I understand, advised the removal of the office towards Eskbank, so as to make it central for both places. Otherwise, a new post-office will need to be erected at Eskbank. At Lithgow, the accommodation supplied to the postmaster and his family is utterly inadequate, and from every stand-point the building is out of date. The necessities of the township demand the erection of a new building. The honorable member for Robertson questioned the need for erecting a post-office at Katoomba, and the Acting Prime Minister said that the population of that centre was 2,500. But I desire honorable members to recollect that those figures represent only the resident population. Katoomba is the centre of a mountain district, and in the summer time instead of possessing a population of 2,500 has a population of nearly 10,000. Yet the post-office there is a building for which we pay &#163;106 annually as rental. It seems to me that we can do very much better than that by erecting a building of our own. </para>

              <para>- I am merely replying to the criticism of the honorable member for Robertson. At Katoomba the parcels post is a stupendous thing to handle, and the Department have found it necessary to erect a building which will provide accommodation for mail carts for parcel delivery instead of hiring vehicles to perform this service, as is, I understand, done at the present time. All the facts show how necessary these buildings are ; and I am sure that if the honorable member for Robertson were acquainted with the facts he would be the last to question the propriety of the expenditure. </para>

            <para>.- I have been making an analysis of the figures before us; and it is just as well to inform honorable members that, while we are providing for an immediate expenditure of &#163;45,200, we are in reality committing ourselves to a total expenditure of &#163;115,600. I am not objecting to the amount, but I urge that the full extent to which we commit ourselves should have been placed before us. For instance, I find that it is proposed to spend &#163;7,310 in the purchase of sites, while, as a matter of fact, we do not know where the sites&#39; are or anything about them. I quite agree with honorable members who have said that figures should have been supplied, so that we might know exactly what we are voting. </para>

              <para>- I rose simply to protest that we should have been supplied with more information. Last night the Acting Prime Minister read out a number of figures relating to the expenditure on rifle ranges; and it would have required only another column in the Estimates, and a little more attention to detail, to supply all the information necessary to a more intelligent vote than we shall be able to give under present circumstances. If the figures were placed before us more concisely, we should clearly know our position ; and it would not be incumbent upon honorable members to investigate for themselves. </para>

              <para>- They are not more deserving than the people of Balmain, but the honorable member is a deserving supporter of the Government. The sum of &#163;4,000 represents about &#163;260 for each of the fifteen municipalities, and, of course, if that- be proved sufficient to provide an effective exchange, I have no more to say. It seems striking, however, that so ardent and straight-out a supporter of the Government as the leader of the Labour Party should have the satisfaction of seeing such a comparatively large sum  devoted to a portion of his constituency. I point out that there are over 30,000 inhabitants in Balmain, who are certainly deserving of some consideration in the way of telephonic facilities. Then, amongst the municipalities, there is Annandale, which, in addition to containing many large works, is a large residential quarter. If it is the policy of the Government to erect telephone exchanges in all large centres, I point out that Annandale has not yet an exchange, though the population there must be about 20,000. I am .pleased to see that some attempt to provide an exchange for Balmain is being made, because such an exchange will serve, not only Balmain itself, but a large urban district behind. Then, again, there is Ashfield, which is a &#34; swell &#34; quarter, for which we are asked to vote &#163;600 now, with the ultimate intention of spending &#163;1,100 on an exchange. I suppose this is the tribute paid by the Government to my esteemed friend the honorable member for Parkes, although that gentleman is opposed to the present Ministry. It would appear that the leader of the Labour Party and the honorable member for Parkes are bosom friends, seeding that they are the only two representatives who have secured a satisfactory ex.penditure on telephone exchanges in their district. On the one hand we have theleader of the Labour Party, and on the other hand the honorable member for Parkes, who is the leader of an inimitableparty of one, though I admit that that party is a very solid one. The electoratesof these two honorable members share between them ,&#163;3,600 of the money proposed! for the provision of telephone exchanges,,, while, as I have already pointed out, fifteen other large municipalities have to be content with &#163;4,000 amongst them. I would be the last to complain, but I must ask if honorable members regard this asfair treatment ! I should like some explanation of these items, though I know that the Treasurer is very much worried* having to answer, not only for his own Ministerial sins, but for the sins of his colleagues. Is the sum of &#163;1,500 proposed for Redfern a kind of return to a Government supporter, while my electorate is; ignored because I am a bitter opponent of the Government? I wonder what the honorable member for Yarra would say if hiselectorate were treated like Balmain? </para>

              <para>- Anyhow, we can- imaginehow Victorian representatives would howl if their electorates were treated as mine is upon these Estimates. This is a serious matter, and I am sure that my electorswill not be pleased with the treatment they have received. Why do the Government frame their Estimates on party lines?1 Even if I. were their bitterest opponent&#39;,, they should not have regard to that fact in determining what public buildingsshould be erected in my constituency. I think that I have made out a strong case. You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> are aware of theextent of the business carried on in Annandale, and I am sure that you will support my contention. I trust that the Treasurer will explain how it is that the electorateof South Sydney has been so generously treated. I do not wish to suggest that where an expenditure of &#163;4,000 would be sufficient to meet the requirements of a district, &#163;5,000 should be expended; but it seems to me that the Department is either too extravagant in the one case to which I have referred or too miserly in the other* </para>

            <para>.- I should like to introduce into the discussion a serious and relevant note. I have no desire to scramble for disbursements. I do not say that since &#163;2,000 is to be expended on public buildings in one electorate, &#163;2,000 or more should be expended in mine; but I regret that the Government have made no provision for the extension of the main trunk telephone line from Sydney to Orange. At the present time the line goes as far as Blayney, and Orange is connected with that town by means of the condenser system. Orange is the centre of the western district, so far as general industrial, agricultural, and pastoral enterprises are concerned, and I hope that, as an act of simple justice, the Government will make provision in the Supplementary Estimates for the extension I have advocated. The proposition is a business one. The telephonic communication between Orange and Sydney is unsatisfactory, by reason of the adoption of the condenser system between the points I have mentioned, and I am satisfied that the extension of the main trunk line from Blayney to Orange, a distance - of between thirty and forty miles, would prove a payable enterprise. Another point which I desire to make is that the Department makes no provision for post-office clocks. Since the Postal Department exacts from the public the observation of time limits, in connexion with mails, it ought to provide official time in all country towns. In many post-offices in my electorate the clocks are often much agley, and I am told that the Department makes no provision for the supply of suitable ones. </para>

              <para>- It will result in an absolute waste of money. Theworkshould not have been commenced if the Government were not prepared to make the additions correspond in height with the main building. At present there is such a lack of room at the General Post Office that Wallach&#39;s buildings, in Elizabeth-street, have had to be rented for postal purposes. A sum of &#163;40,000 is to be expended on alterations to the General Post Office, Sydney, and I fail to see why the additions to the Melbourne office should not be carried to the height of the present structure. If a permanent roof be placed on the one-story addition, an absolute waste of money will take place, because, sooner or later, it will be found necessary to carry up the additions to the height of the main building. I hope that the Government will look into this matter, and, if necessary, provide on the Supplementary Estimates the amount necessary to complete the work in the way I have indicated. The expenditure, like that on the alterations to the Sydney General Post Office, could be spread over a number of years. I notice that it is proposed to expend &#163;4,000 on a post-office at Hawthorn. I have not a word to say against the item, but I think that we should have some information as to the revenue derived from the local postoffice at the present time. </para>

I have here a return presented to the order of the House nearly two years ago, which shows that some of the contract post-offices have a revenue of from &#163;1,500 to nearly &#163;2,000 per annum. </para>

If it were abolished many people in the country would suffer serious inconvenience. I certainly think, however, that every contract office should be made an official office as soon as its revenue goes beyond a certain point. I trust that we shall have an explanation regarding the contract for the additions to the Melbourne General Post Office, and that the Government will take care that a waste of money does not occur. </para>

            <para>. - Before the discussion of the question proceeds any further, I think it would be desirable to give the Committee the information that has been supplied to me with regard to the additions to the Melbourne General Post Office. The estimated cost of the present extension is &#163;30,000. The amount now submitted is the first instalment towards the cost of building the basement and ground floor of portion of ultimate extension northward, covering about one-half of the present unoccupied portion of the site. The additional accommodation provided will be absorbed by the Letter-carriers&#39; and Mail Branch, and increased accommodation will be afforded for registration, inquiry, stamps, and telegraph offices. The proposal also includes provision for a telegram receivingroom in the main building. A contract for &#163;20,785 is now in progress. </para>

              <para>- Some very large sums are to be expended on Victorian post-offices. For instance, &#163;600 is to be spent at Brunswick, and &#163;2,000 on a building at Hawthorn, the total cost of which is to be &#163;4,000. The suggestion that full information should be published and distributed amongst honorable members in. regard to all these items is one which I hope will be favorably considered by Ministers. We cannot be expected to vote money without knowing that the expenditure is justifiable. The Minister has given us no information, except such as has been dragged out of him, and even then only grudgingly, in reply to questions, and a return such as has been suggested would prove very valuable to honorable members&#39;. In view of what has been said by the honorable member for Yarra, as to the contemplated extravagance of placing a permanent roof upon the unfinished additions to the Melbourne General Post Office, I think that the Committee should do all it can to prevent such a waste of money, and therefore I move - </para>

              <para>- The last PostmasterGeneral distinctly promised that the extension to the General Post Office, Melbourne, should be in keeping with the original structure, and I feel sure that if an appeal were made to them, New South Wales members would join in a request for an extension of the building from street to street. Unfortunately, it is not to be at present extended right through to Little Bourke-street ; but to send away parcels or money orders, one has to go to a building in Little Bourke-street, which just there is called Post Office-place. I understand, too, that a portion of Messrs. Wallach Brothers&#39; building has been rented for post-office business. I hope that the Postmaster-General will see the&#39; desirability of keeping to the- original plans, and will not allow one of the best&#34; buildings in Melbourne to be disfigured. </para>

            <para>.- My* experience of the postal authorities is that&#39;, they are not too ready to spend money in New South Wales. I do not know  whether  that is because of the large amount, which they are spending in Victoria. I&#39; hope that the present Postmaster-General will put a check on the contract post-office system. If it grows as it has done, we may reasonably expect to find the General Post Offices of the capitals ultimately converted into contract offices. There is a considerable number of contract offices in my electorate. The rule of the Department is that when the revenue of an office reaches &#163;400 per annum, it may be made an official office. In some cases postal business is transacted in the offices of railway stationmasters, an unsatisfactory arrangement, though one which is unavoidable in certain places. But I know of an instance in which the business of such an office was transferred to a contract office, the contractor binding himself, in consideration of a three years&#39; lease, to put up a building, and to find a telegraph messenger. Although the revenue of that office is &#163;354, which is not far short of &#163;400, the Department would not depart from its rule, and make the office an official office. By keeping so many contract offices, we are preventing our officials from rising in the service as rapidly as they might reasonably expect to do. I trust that the Postmaster-General will obtain a grip of this matter. In some places the contractors have to find the  necessary  building,  provide  th&#62;i telegraph operators and telegraph messengers - in short, to run the whole concern. I hold that if a district is likely to grow the Department should provide its own officer. In my own electorate the system to which I refer has been abused, and I protest against it. In my opinion, a sufficient sum has not been providedupon these Estimates for the payment of these officials. The Department is acting, in a niggardly fashion, and is really sweating these persons in that they are not fairly remunerated for their services. </para>

            <para>-. -  There are one or two items connected with the proposed expenditure in Queensland to which I desire to direct attention. I am pleased to note that the Department intends to make some provision for alterations to the General Post Office, Brisbane. These alterations are sadly needed. But I would point out to the PostmasterGeneral that Queensland is comparatively a new country, and that the rural districts are in need of postal facilities. It seems to me that these have been somewhat overlooked. </para>

              <para>- I do not. I merely wish to give the Postmaster-General a hint or two. I have no doubt that portion of the proposed expenditure of &#163;1,633 upon various offices is intended to improve the Beaudesert post-office. &#39; I desire to point out that Beaudesert is the centre of a very large farming district, which is being thickly settled. Several large estates in that locality have recently been subdivided for purposes of closer settlement, and I am hopeful that others will be similarly treated. Various mail routes radiate from this centre, and consequently it would be a mistake for the Postal Department to &#34; patch &#34; up the old building, which is certainly too small for the requirements of Beaudesert. I would, therefore, urge upon the Government the necessity for erecting a new post-office there. T ask the Postmaster-General not ti., be quite so parsimonious in regard to outside post-offices. We have heard. a good deal in reference to &#34;contract or semi-official post-offices, which are really indispensable in country districts. Many of these small offices are conducted by people merely for  the benefit of the locality in which they reside ; and I should be sorry to see them abolished, unless it be in centres large enough to support official offices. I am pleased to note that Gatton is to have a new post-office ; and this brings me to the question of the post-offices conducted under the auspices of the Commissioners of Railways. Very often, the dual position of the railway officials in this connexion, leads to some inconvenience to the public ; and there is another objection which appeals to me as requiring some little consideration on the part of the Minister. Those railway officials, who conduct postal business, are not really in the employ of the Postmaster-General, but they should, I think, be paid directly by him, and, to some extent, be brought under the control of the Department. </para>

              <para>- I understand that the Postal Department pays a lump sum to the Railway Departments; but the officials who conduct some of the small country post-offices in connexion with the railways,&#39; seem to have an idea that they are not paid for- the services they render. I&#39; km sorry to have to refer to this matter, because remarks made here may be taken as a reflection on States Departments with which we have nothing to do. However, I know &#39; from personal experience, that those rail-r way officials, who are employed on postal business, are of. opinion, in some instances, that they are not paid by the Common. wealth Government for the services , they render. There is another matter which might have the attention of the PostmasterGeneral, namely, the guarantees given by local residents in connexion with telephone exchanges. I know of one case in my electorate, where the revenue from a guaranteed exchange exceeded in one month the estimated revenue for twelve months; and the guarantors find that the money thev deposited is tied up for seven years. Under the circumstances, I think that the guarantee ought to be refunded. Another matter. I should like to refer to is that of the lighting of country post-offices. These may be matters which could be discussed with the  Deputy  Postmasters- General, but there appears to be a general instruction that the expenses are to be kept down to the lowest possible limit. On one occasion, I asked to have a post-office lighted so that the holders of private boxes might be enabled to see to open their boxes, and to decipher the addresses on their letters ; but the request was refused on the ground that an hotel would shortly be opened opposite to the post-office, and that the light from the hotel ought to be sufficient. </para>

              <para>- At any rate, the railway journey gives one the impression that the distance is very great. When I visited the town it did not appear to me to be one in which an expe&#39;nditure of &#163;3,000 on a post-office would be justified. Perhaps, however, the Minister will give us some information relating to population and so forth. </para>

            <para>That the item &#34; Northam Post Office - Towards cost,  &#163;2,000,&#34;  be reduced by ^1,000. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>The total cost of this work is to be &#163;2,900, but I think that &#163;1,900 should be adequate for the purpose. As most honorable members are aware, Northam is a small town in an agricultural district, and a post-office is already in existence there. It is idle to complain of excessive expenditure unless we axe prepared to support the reduction of any proposed vote which we consider to be unnecessary. Surely it is not necessary to expend &#163;2,900 on a post-office where the business is not likely to be very extensive. I have visited&#39; Northam. There are refreshment rooms at the railway station- </para>

I have nothing to say against Northam, but I would remind the Committee that, as the custodians of the public purse, we should not support any expenditure which does not appear justifiable. There are in various parts of the Commonwealth districts in which increased postal facilities- are absolutely necessary, and where the inconvenience suffered by the people is far greater than is that of the residents of Northam, who complain that to reach the post-office from the business part of the town they have to cross the railway line. </para>

              <para>- It is. The honorable member for Boothby, with his slight knowledge of the conditions of Northam, is taking upon himself a serious responsibility in asking the Committee to reduce an item which the Government, after careful inquiry and consideration, have proposed. There has been, for some years, ar, agitation foi a new post-office at Northam. The question of cost is a matter that I cannot discuss with any degree of confidence, but it has been considered by the architects of the Department of Home Affairs, who know the class of building required for the district, and have estimated the expenditure that it will involve. Northam is one of the most important inland towns in Western Australia. It is at the junction of two lines of railway, and is in the centre of a large agricultural district. </para>

              <para>- Yes, and it is a very important agricultural centre. Some of the best land in Western Australia is to be found around Northam. The GoomallingDowerin railway, junctions with the main line from Fremantle to Kalgoorlie there, and the Spencer&#39;s Brook railway junction, where the railway to York and Albany joins the same main line is six miles away, and the branch railway to Newcastle is also close at hand. Although &#163;2,900 may seem a fairly large sum to expend on this building, we may be surethat the officers of the Department of Home Affairs would not propose a larger expenditure than is necessary. </para>

              <para>- Quite so., When the present office was erected, no- one imagined that the town would progress as it has done. It is in the heart of the agricultural belt of Western Australia. There are some very fine flour mills in the town, and&#39; since private* individuals and companies have not been afraid to invest money in the erection of substantial hotels and banking institutions there, the Commonwealth should not hesitate to erect a building necessary to meet the requirements of the district. The criticism of the honorable member for Boothby cannot count for much, since he was not even aware that there is no refreshmentroom at the local railway station. A mere flying visit to the West is not sufficient to enable honorable members to express an authoritative opinion on the requirements of the inland towns of the State. </para>

            <para>.- On reconsideration, the honorable member for Boothby may probably feel inclined to withdraw his amendment for the reduction of the proposed expenditure on the Northam post-office. Northam is a township situated in one of the finest agricultural districts in Western Australia, and a very promising and rapidly developing- centre. At this particular time it would be very inadvisable to do anything tending to. further alienate the people of Western Australia in regard to Federation. </para>

              <para>- If the honorable member were a close reader of the newspapers of the State, and knew a little as to what the feeling is there in regard to Federation, he would not be disposed to press an amendment, the adoption . of  which might tend to widen the existing breach. The people of New South Wales are at times inclined to be irritable, because certain departments of government are administered from Melbourne; but if, instead of being 500 or 600 miles from the Seat of Government they were 2,000 or 2,500, and had no direct land communication, the feeling would be much stronger; and the honorable member, having fuller knowledge, would more keenly  appreciate the position of Western Australia. I do not say for a moment that we should, under threat of secession, do anything in the nature of undue favoritism, or by evincing fear of the movement, but we ought not to do anything to intensify the present high state of feeling in the isolated western State. The honorable member knows the desirability of not magnifying any little grievances- which New South Wales may have in regard* to Federation. </para>

              <para>- I think that there is an intimate connexion. The point I am making is that it is undesirable to reduce the Estimates; because, amongst other reasons, the reduction might intensify the feeling against Federation which exists in Western Australia. I take it that I am in order in adducing that  reason as a justification for opposing the amendment.&#39; I ask the honorable member for Robertson to place himself in the position of the citizens of Western Australia, who feel that their State has not been well treated by the Commonwealth. </para>

              <para>- Yes. The honorable member for Boothby has had considerable experience of Ministerial office, and must know that departmental officials may be trusted in a matter of this kind to see that no extravagance is indulged in.- Nothing is to be provided beyond what is required by the necessities of the case. The importance of the district has been em phasized by the honorable member for Swan, who has more knowledge of it than any one else on this side of the Australian Bight, and by the honorable member for Fremantle. It is a rapidly-developing township, and the centre of perhaps the richest agricultural area in Western Australia. </para>

            <para>- - I knew Northam when it was a very insignificant hamlet, before the railway was taken through it, and on revisiting it, after an absence of twelve years, I found that it had made wonderful strides. It is, indeed, the only instance I know of in which what was a terminal railway townhas been increased in importance by the extension of the railway beyond it. The reason for this is &#39; that Northam is the centre of an agricultural district which supplies - produce to the mining districts. Out in the desert they grow nothing. </para>

              <para>- The railway has cut off the old post-office from the busiest part of the town, and as two line&#34; junction there, it is often dangerous to tr&#62; to cross. I hope that the honorable member for Boothby will withdraw his amendment. I am not influenced by the remarks of the honorable member for Coolgardie. The magnificent post-office at Coolgardie is one of the greatest white elephants that I have ever seen, because the town is practically forsaken. &#39;But I think this work should be undertaken, not because I am afraid of encouraging the secession movement in Western Australia, which I regard as a huge joke, placing no importance upon the speeches which have been made on the subject, but because the people of Northam have a just claim for consideration. If the amendment is pressed to a division, I shall vote against it. </para>

              <para>- I do not intend to do so. I am, however, entitled to point to the difference between the tone adopted by the honorable member for Coolgardie 3n advocating the claims of his own State, ;ind that which is adopted by other honorable members of this Committee. When I heard the honorable member talking in the way that he did of the feeling in Western Australia, I could not help admiring him for his patriotism and loyalty to that State, notwithstanding the view which he entertains regarding the merits of the question. I wish that we had more like him in this Chamber. I have yet to learn that to be a Federalist, it is necessary for an honorable member to be constantly tilting at his own State. But even the conduct of the honorable member himself is not uniform- </para>

              <para>- Yes. I am endeavouring to urge reasons why this item should be agreed to. The honorable member for Coolgardie has made an appeal which merits our consideration. He has appealed to us to agree to the item as a sort of salve to the feelings of the people of the State which he represents. I wish to contrast his action to-night with his action upon another occasion, when the interests of the State of New South Wales were involved. Upon the latter occasion, he declared that he would do nothing for New South Wales, and he even went to the length of saying that he would vote against the Capital Site because he would not heed the violent incendiary there. </para>

            <para>.- When the honorable member for Parramatta rose just now, he put a very pertinent question to the Committee. He asked whether the honorable member for Coolgardie was the same honorable member whom we heard speak in this Chamber last evening. When I listened to the speech of the honorable member for Parramatta I asked myself the same question in regard to himself. In my judgment there has been another change of garment. In listening to the plea put forward by the honorable member for Coolgardie in favour of the expenditure proposed upon the new post-office at Northam, I could not help wondering whether he was born in Ireland, and whether he had not spent a considerable portion of his time in paying homage to the historic blarney stone. The appeal which he made to the Committee to allay the anti-Federal irritation in Western Australia, and to stop the movement towards .secession, is certainly one that honorable members will receive with a great deal of caution. But I would point out that the people of Western Australia did not spare the feelings of honorable members of this Parliament in connexion with certain legislation which was enacted a little time ago. </para>

I am disposed to support the amendment of the honorable member for Boothby, because the expenditure proposed at Northam seems to me to be excessive. We have been told that the population of the town is 5,500, but I. can scarcely credit that statement. I do not think that its population exceeds 500. </para>

              <para>- I spent an hour or two there, and I do not think that the population of the town numbers anything like 5,000. In my judgment those figures must include the inhabitants of the surrounding district for 100 miles. The honorable member for Robertson, in supporting this item, referred to the danger to life and limb, caused by having the postoffice located upon one side of the railway, whilst the principal business centre is upon the other side. He urged this as a reason why a new building should be erected. One would imagine that there was immense traffic over the line, something like that between Flinders-street and the south side of the Yarra. But how many trains pass through Northam in the twenty-four hours? In any case, would it not be much more economical to construct an overhead bridge for &#163;300 or &#163;400? The honorable member for Swan, when the honorable member for Boothby proposed a reduction, interjected, &#34; Oh ! we can sell the old building for more than honorable members are asked to vote for a new one.&#34; Yet, a little while afterwards, when addressing the Committee, he. said that the present post-office was an old building, and practically worthless, or words to that effect. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member said more than that ; he said it was an old building of an old type. The plea put forward by the Honorable member for Boothby in favour of a reduction is a sound one. If we spend a sum much less than that proposed in improving the existing building, sufficient will be left to provide the overhead bridge which is the source of so much anxiety to the honorable member for Robertson. But, seeing that we have passed the Estimates for most of the States, I feel reluctant to appear to single out Western Australia for a reduction of this character; I suggest, however, that some effort be made to obtain an offer for the present post-office, as a set off against the cost of the new one. </para>

              <para>- I suppose that is within a radius of live miles, although one honorable member suggested that it would be necessary to take a radius of 100 miles, in order to find a population of 5,000. The honorable member for Boothby is consistent in submitting his amendment, but he would have been still more consistent had he moved the omission of the item. I have a little knowledge of this district, and I know it to be an important one, which, I believe, in the near future, will prove of even more consequence than the great town of Kalgoorlie is at the present time. </para>

              <para>- I must ask the honorable member to keep quiet. I do not consider that &#163;2,900 is too much for the erection of a substantial post-office in so important a district. The honorable member for Yarra said that he had seen most expensive buildings as post-offices in Queensland; but I venture to say that the accommodation in that State is not in excess of the requirements. The post-offices of Queensland are not built merely for today, but for the next twenty or fifty years ; and I hope that the building in contemplation at Northam is of a similar character. I shall support the item. </para>

            <para>.- I am afraid that the support I am receiving in my efforts to secure economy cannot be called enthusiastic. However, the criticism offered does not allay my anxiety as to the justification for this item ; and the reasons advanced by the honorable member for Coolgardie do not strengthen the case for a new post-office at Northam. I do not think that if we pass this vote we shall in any way weaken the cause of secession in the western State. The spirit displayed by honorable members on this item is not that in which we ought to approach proposals by the Government for  expenditure on new works. The sole questions we have to ask ourselves are whether the work is justified, and whether it . is not on a more elaborate scale than is necessary. I do not object to the fact that the total sum we are asked to expend on new works in Western Australia amounts to some  &#163;57,000,  which is much larger than the proposed expenditure in South Australia, where the population is very nearly double that of the western State. </para>

              <para>- But Western Australia keeps its revenue to itself. It has been urged that we should pass this item because Western Australia is a long way off, and is deserving of sympathy and liberality. I point out, however, that, apart altogether from this item, we are liberal and sympathetic in regard to the western State. If there is anything in the argument of the honorable member for Robertson as to the danger of crossing the line, it is an argument for building new post-offices in very many other places in Australia. The question for us is whether it is necessary to expend as much as is proposedon the post-office at Northam ; and the. position that I have taken up is supported by the reply of the Treasurer that the existing building is sufficient for present requirements. I apparently have no support for my amendment ; but, nevertheless, it is our duty to criticise these proposals, and not accept them blindly. </para>

            <para>.- I am rather surprised at the vote proposed for Tasmania this year, in view of the fact that last year an expenditure of  &#163;330  was voted, of which only  &#163;140  was spent. We are therefore asked to re- vote money ; and, with some additions, we have the total of  &#163;975.  Under this head the proposed expenditure in the other States is as follows: - New South Wales, &#163;34,246; Victoria,  &#163;58,300  ; Queensland,  &#163;30,086 ;  South Australia,  &#163;14,977;and  Western Australia,  &#163;8,494.  Some time ago the present Minister of Trade and Customs, when Postmaster-General, visiting Tasmania, received a large deputation in reference to alterations at the Launceston post-office, and gave the request preferred a very favorable reception. Some time afterwards the honorable member for Swan, as Acting Prime Minister, paid a visit to Launceston, and also gave the mayor of the city a favorable reply in reference to suggested expenditure in this connexion. The honorable gentleman raised some difficulty about the winding of the post-office clock when it should be placed in position, but the local municipal council undertook to keep the clock in good order and repair. The citizens raised over  &#163;1,000  towards the cost of placing a clock and chimes in the post-office tower, and I am willing on their behalf to guarantee that the whole sum necessary for that purpose will be provided if this Parliament willvote the money requisite to cover the cost of altering the tower. </para>

              <para>- Tasmania, like Western Australia, is a growing State. Within my own electorate three blocks of ground have been reserved by the Government for post-offices, but although other parts of the Commonwealth are able to secure the erection of new buildings, we cannot do so. So far as I am aware since the establishment of Federation only one new post-office has been built in Tasmania. The Launceston post-office tower was so badly constructed that I do not think &#163;400 will be sufficient to cany out the  necessary  alterations. It is true thatI pressed the Minister to make some provision for this work,  but I think that the amount set apart is inadequate. The citizens of Launceston are so disgusted with the delay that has taken place that some of them have been suggesting in letters to the press that a tower should be built on the town hall, and the chimes and clock erected there, since they do not consider that the postoffice is&#39; really their own property. Considering the number of improvements that are absolutely&#34; necessary in connexion with post-offices in Tasmania, I think that the proposed vote is altogether too small; and since only &#163;140 was spent upon them last year, no one can say that the Federal Government have been guilty of extravagance in connexion with the postal services of that State. I am glad, however, that we are to have something like &#163;400 spent this year on the alterations to the Launceston post-office tower, and I presume that we shall obtain a further grant of &#163;400. </para>

            <para>. - Something like three or four years ago, when I held office as Minister of Home Affairs, my attention was directed to the Launceston tower, which is known as &#34; the pepper-box,&#34; and is certainly deserving of the name. I promised at the time that if the opportunity offered I would endeavour to have, the necessary alterations made. The tower as it stands is a disgrace to the architect who designed it, and unworthy of Launceston. I did not know what was the amount to be set apart for the alterations, but my impression is that &#163;400 will be insufficient. If the work is to be undertaken it should be properly carried out. If it should be found that &#163;400 is insufficient, I have no doubt that we shall be able to find another &#163;100. My desire is that the tower, as reconstructed, shall not be an eyesore. The people of Launceston have made a very good offer in regard to the provision of a clock and chimes, and I do not think that we ought to be very chary about giving them an extra &#163;100 or &#163;200 if it be required for this work. The honorable member for Bass has fought hard for this work, and he may accept my assurance that the existing ugly tower will notbe allowed to stand. This item also provides for additions to the post-offices at Queenstown, Ulverstone, and sundry offices, as may be required. The total is very small, but the works other than that relating to the Launceston post-office may not be extensive. A number of people in Launceston, as well as some of the citizens of Hobart, said that they did not desire that the Federation should expend a large sum in that State, because the money would have to come out of their pockets. Probably that is the reason why a larger sum has not been provided. </para>

            <para>.- The Postmaster- General should give us some information regarding the trunk telephone line between Sydney and Melbourne. When its construction was originally contemplated it was the subject of strong protest in this House. I and others pointed out - and I think very properly - that, whatever revenue might be obtained from it would in reality be subtracted from the revenue derived from the telegraph service between the two capitals. A careful analysis of the receipts will show that that assertion was well founded. This long; trunk telephone line has merely resulted&#34; in a decrease of the telegraphic business between the two States. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member knows full well that the minimum wage in. the Commonwealth public service is not the maximum. The Public Service Commissioner has carefully graded the service, and officers are paid according to their classification. The Committee ought to protest against the spineless action of the Government in yielding to this agitation. _ Whouse this trunk telephone line? Not the working people. </para>

              <para>- Of course, if charges are piled up at the top they are ultimately transmitted to the bottom. But in thiscase the difference is very small, and the clamour for reduction is like that for the reduction of the postage from 2d. to id. The present rates are not felt by the customers of the big houses, though they are considerable to the big houses themselves. It is a curious thing that the Government has no sooner got this great public utility into working order than the large daily newspapers, which are the organs of the merchants, who support them with extensive advertisements, ask for a cheaper service. </para>

              <para>- The Government should stiffen itself to resist the demands which are continually being made by these classes for the reduction of telephone rates, and other charges for other public services. We have a similar agitation for the retention of the flat system, under which business houses making 200 or 300 calls a day pay no more than the small trader whose calls number only ten or twenty a day. </para>

              <para>- If the charge were greatly reduced during slack periods, I think there would be frequent family conversations, which would prove profitable to the Department. I rose largely to urge the Minister to see that there shall be no delay in segregating the accounts of the Telephone, Telegraph,and Postal Departments, so that Parliament may know how they are conducted as business enterprises. At the present time the revenue from each Department is set out separately, so that the segregation I speak of ought not to be difficult. I wish also to direct attention to the fact that many telephone subscribers are now charged unfairly high rates owing to the manner in which the Department has located its exchanges in post-offices. Many of these post-offices were established years ago, when the. population of the suburbs was smaller and differently centred, and their use as telephone exchanges often makes the mileage charged to subscribers very heavy. </para>

              <para>- That is the system which I complain of. There is a large and populous area at Kew, which, instead of haying a telephone exchange of its own, is connec(ted with  the  Hawthorn exchange, and consequently Kew subscribers have to pay mileage rates, and are in a worse position than are those living in the Hawthorn district proper. I think that the Committee should insist on tlie Ministry altering this state of affairs. So far as the telephone service is concerned, I cannot conceive of a more distracting employment than that of the telephone operator. I ask the PostmasterGeneral whether he is not reducing the advantages which might be conferred bv this public utility by neglecting to employ sufficient assistants in some of our telephone exchanges. I recollect visiting one of these exchanges in company with the honorable gentleman, and I say that the distracting nature of the work which some of the operators are called upon to perform should be taken into serious consideration with a view to seeing that these officers are not taxed beyond human endurance. Incidentally, during the current session a telephone exchange has been established in the vaults of our parliamentary buildings. I favour a reversion to the old system, because under the new arrangement it is much more difficult to get into communication with a subscriber than it was previously ; and that is the feeling of most honorable members. I also desire to direct the attention of the Minister to the necessity, which exists for furnishing honorable members with a proper statement of accounts in regard to the working of the telephonic department. </para>

              <para>- I am not speaking upon this matter without knowledge, and I maytell the Minister of Trade and Customs that there is no statement in the Budget showing the profit or loss involved in the working of the Department. I believe that the Postmaster-General recognises the need for reform in this direction, and therefore I shall not dwell upon that aspect of the case. I earnestly hope that he will give favorable consideration to our representations, because -the public - whilst desiring improved telephonic facilities - are anxious to know whether the working of this facility results in a profit or a loss. The statements made by the honorable member for Coolgardie concerning the number of calls made by many of the merchants of Melbourne under the flat-rate system were very greatly exaggerated. I say this very confidently, because when the toll system was first projected the Chambers of Commerce in Sydney and Melbourne requested, the merchants of those cities to furnish them with returns setting forth the number of calls which they made daily. I recognise that public opinion is rapidly coming to regard the toll system as the most convenient one. I hold that the payments made by telephone subscribers should be proportionate to the services which they receive, and I have consistently maintained that view. </para>

              <para>- Very likely. Probably the Treasurer of the day supported the honorable gentleman. When I took exception to the amount placed upon . the Estimates for the erection of a post-office in Western Australia, it was alleged that I was influenced by provincial motives. As a matter of fact, I fail to see why those persons using the telephone trunk line between Sydney and Melbourne should be placed in a different category from that occupied by residents in the country who desire telephonic facilities. The latter are compelled to guarantee the Department against loss. When the honorable member for Maranoa and the honorable member for Coolgardie asked that the same procedure should be adopted in regard to the trunk telephone line between Sydney and Melbourne, the reply which they received was, &#34; Oh, but this line villE pav from the jump.&#34; But what do we find? As soon as the charges were fixed an. agitation was promoted by those interested with a view to their reduction. </para>

              <para>- Country residents who desire telephonic facilities are asked to guarantee the Department against loss, and why should city residents be placed in a different position ? As the result of a little research I find that the charges levied byprivate enterprise in other parts of the world over long distance telephone lines are more than double those charged by the Government. After 8 o&#39;clock in the evening the trunk telephone is used mainly by the press, who resort to it instead of to the telegraph. Until we have a report, a balance-sheet, or statement - call it what we may - showing the receipts and expenditure of the three separate branches - telephone, telegraph. and postal - we shall find it impossible to say how much we are losing in any particular direction. I am delighted at the marvellous change that is apparently coming over many honorable members regarding the toll system. I well remember, when the Reid-McLean Government were in power, the honorable member for Barrier raising the question on the Estimates, and the honorable member for Gwydir subsequently submitted a motion, and gave us full information regarding this system in various parts of the world. We are now told by the honorable member for Corio that the toll&#39; subscribers have increased facilities as compared with the flat-raters. </para>

              <para>- In my opinion, the honorable member is absolutely wrong. I am positive that if he took the trouble to inquire, or to visit the exchange, he would find that it is nearly impossible for the operator at the switchboard to tell whether he is communicating with a flat-rate or a toll subscriber; and, in my opinion, both classes receive exactly the same attention. No doubt the switchboard in Melbourne is not as perfect as it might be ; but I hope this will be remedied by means of the vote we are asked to pass. I was rather interested to learn that flat-rate subscribers use the telephone three times as often, or, in other words, get three times as much value for their money, as do the toll-rate subscribers. This probably accounts for the complaint that the flat-raters do not receive such good attention. If the toll-rate subscribers averaged only five calls each per day, I have no doubt that the Department would see that the operators in charge at the Exchange were given at least three times as many calls as at present to look after. I trust that the tollrate system will become more popular, and that, as in other parts of the world, greater use will be made of the telephone. I was sorry that the honorable member for Kooyong was absent when I raised the same question as he raised to-night, namely, the great disability which certain subscribers surfer, merely because they happen to be a certain distance from an exchange. I hope, not only that we shall have a report or statement such as I have suggested, but that the system will be thoroughly overhauled by the present Postmaster-General, with a view to greater economy and efficiency. </para>

              <para>- But it was completed by the present Minister of Trade and Customs. I hope, before long, to see all the capitals of Australia connected by tele phone - Adelaide with Melbourne, Brisbane with Sydney, and, if possible, Perth with Adelaide. In the old world it is usual to find all the capital cities thus connected, and Australia cannot afford to lag behind. Apparently, the honorable member for Yarra is troubled with the idea that one section of the community is getting some special advantage over the rest of the community. In the early days of telephones very few people were connected; and the popularity of the system has been, and is, a matter of growth. Each householder who has ani installation advertises the system, and once a man is accustomed to the convenience, he would rather cut clown his expenses in another direction, than relinquish it. We find that in any given neighbourhood where there are five installations, there are ten in a short time ; and thus they increase in geometrical ratio. </para>

              <para>- And what occurs with the ordinary telephone will occur in connexion with the trunk line. The honorable member for Coolgardie, directing his glances to this side of the House, talked of &#34; merchant princes &#34; of Australia, who, according to&#39; him, enjoy some advantage. I have had experience in parliamentary life for some years, and I must say that, with, perhaps, the exception of the honorable member for Lang, I see no one very like a merchant prince on this side of the House. If I were to imitate &#34;the honorable member, I might direct my glances to honorable members opposite, and talk about the advantages which the millionaire manufacturers of Victoria have over the rest of the community. But that is an absurd argument ; because both classes to which I have referred are out with the intention of making money. And that is the position of the press also. The honorable member for Coolgardie, when he attacks the press, forgets that only two or three years ago he and others fought for special telegraph rates for the benefit of the newspaper proprietors of Australia. An ordinary citizen communicating by telegraph on private business, has, roughly speaking, to pay for forty words the same amount for which a newspaper proprietor can telegraph 1.000 words. The honorable member for Coolgardie, if he were consistent, should say, &#34; The press is a money-making concern, conducted by journalistic princes, and they ought to be compelled to pay the same telegraph rates as do ordinary citizens.&#34; Now, no one would, I think, advance such a contention ; and the position I am putting applies with equal force to the arguments advanced by the honorable member for Yarra. Whether there be fifty calls or ten calls over a trunk line, the cost of conducting the service is exactly the same. We have to consider the cost of construction, the cost of maintenance, and the cost of supervision, and the last-mentioned has to be incurred whatever may be the number of calls. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member for Yarra ought to have opposed the establishment of the trunk telephone line, if there is anything in his present argument, or he should have insisted on &#34;a guarantee. All the Postmaster-General has to do is to look at the matter in a business light, and consider what rate will offer the biggest inducement to the public, and, at the same time, pay interest on the outlay. The Postmaster-General has had experience of a 6s. rate, and of a 5s. rate&#39;; and, in my opinion, the more we cheapen the facilities the more they will be used.  If there were 200 calls a day at 5s., the revenue would be ,&#163;50; whereas 150 calls at 6s. would mean a return. of only &#163;45. In my opinion, it is only a matter of time when the rate will be reduced to 4s. It does not matter who uses the telephone, provided that proper facilities are given, and that the Department has a proper return. I should like to know whether the use of the trunk Inter-State telephone is growing? </para>

              <para>- That is an answer to the honorable member for Yarra, who suggests that a special return should be provided, because he believes that those who use the telephone are depriving the telegraph branch of revenue. But such an argument would apply to the use of all telephoned. We know that the telephone system has deprived a number of messengers, cabmen, and others of work, but no one would dream of condemning the telephone on that account. This is not a conflict between the telegraph and the tele phone, but merely a question of convenience. If a man desires to communicate speedily, he will readily pay the higher rate for the telephone as compared with the telegraph. Speaking generally, my experience is that the telephone service is well conducted. The operators at the switchboard are invariably civil and most attentive; and the least we can do is to pay a tribute of admiration for a hardworking branch of the service. Indeed, it is a wonder that the telephone operators are not more ill-tempered than they appear to be, considering their nerve-racking work. I know that, in view of the irritability of some subscribers, if I were an operator I should be discharged in half-a-day, because my language in reply to some of the remarks made, would simply fuse the wires. Altogether those who are responsible for the conduct of the telephone service deserve every commendation. The advocates of the Inter-State line cannot be said to be fighting for a privileged class. It is designed to convenience all classes of the community, and I hope that the charge will be finally reduced to even 2s. or 3s. for a conversation of three minutes&#39; duration. I care not whether the press messages passing between Melbourne and Sydney are sent by telephone or by telegraph, but I should Le pleased if the wires were more freely used to transmit the observations made by me and many other honorable&#39; members of this Parliament. I would ask the Postmaster-General to let us know whether the revenue from the line is anything like sufficient to pay interest on the original outlay, and the cost of supervision ? </para>

              <para>- I shall supply that information presently. The difference between the price of copper at the time the estimate was given and when the wire was purchased, accounts for nearly the whole of the increased cost. The revenue required to yield 5 per cent. on the cost of the line, &#163;46,686, is roughly, &#163;2,334. The cost of operating will be approximately, &#163;400. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member knows as well as I do what is the rate of pay received by telephone operators. The loss of telegraph revenue due to the construction of the line is estimated at &#163;2,500 per annum. That, I think, is a liberal allowance. If we take &#163;2,334 as representing 5 per cent. on the first cost, &#163;400 as the cost of operators, and &#163;2,500 as the estimated loss of telegraph revenue, we have a total of &#163;5,234. We have also toremember that something must be placed to the credit of the line in respect of its use for telegraphic purposes. If it were not so used, the increased business between Melbourne and Sydney would necessitate the erection of another telegraph line. It is only reasonable that we should credit this line with telegraphic revenue to the extent of, say, &#163;1,200. That would leave a balance of &#163;4,034 per annum still to be found. The receipts for the week ending 13th September amounted to &#163;62, which would be equal to &#163;3,224 per annum. </para>

              <para>- I understand that the Postmaster-General proposes, and very properly, I think, to advertise the new line, in order that the facilities which it offers may be more generally known. The public ought to know, for instance, that after 8 p.m. a three-minutes&#39; conversation over the line costs only 2s. 6d., and I believe that it will not be long before the service will be very largely availed of. The cost of maintenance would not be increased even if the business were doubled. The honorable member for Riverina has referred to the establishment of a sinking fund, and I think that 5 per cent. should provide for replacement of lines and maintenance. A copper wire has a long life, and since other lines are carried on the posts on which this wire is stretched, some part of their maintenance must be charged against them. I am prepared to accept the estimate that is supplied to us, not to prove any case, but as the deliberately prepared calculation of the officers of the Department. It will be remembered that when the estimate was made it was intended to allow intermediate stations to be connected. Had that course been adopted, there can be no doubt that the revenue from the line would have been increased. But in order to give better facilities to the capital cities, the intermediate stations have not been let in. It is estimated that the business will grow so  rapidly that the line will scon be up to the paying standard. </para>

In making his attack on this line, the honorable member for Coolgardie said that when the proposal was originally before the Committee I gave honorable members an assurance that a charge of 6s. per conversation of three minutes would be adhered to, and that but for that it would not have been agreed to. The only statement that I made in regard to the rate to be fixed was that it would not exceed 6s. per conversation of three minutes. The honorable member said, further, that as soon as the merchant &#34; gang &#34; clamoured for a reduction the Government climbed down. He declared that we were always ready to yield to the clamour of a &#34; gang &#39; &#39; of merchants, and that this continual weakness on our part showed that we were spineless. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member spoke of the weakness of the Ministry. He said that we climbed down in obedience to the clamour of a &#34; gang &#34; of merchants, and spoke of what he described as our spineless action. If those were not hard things to say, I do not wish to hear any from him. I have no quarrel with the honorable member. I have given the Committee the facts, and I think that they furnish a complete answer to our critics. I have yet to learn that it is wrong for the Post and Telegraph Department to do anything to facilitate the business of merchants and traders generally. Surely they are entitled to fair and reasonable consideration. The honorable member&#39;s statement about the spinelessness of the Government and our yielding to the clamour of &#34; gangs &#34; of merchants will appear in cold type in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and surely it is necessary that some answer should be made to them. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member for Kooyong asked for some information as to the&#39; receipts and expenditure of the Department. I would remind him that the Treasurer, in delivering his Budget statement, read a table on the subject, which appears in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> It shows that the receipts for the year ended 30th June, 1907, were as follows: - New South Wales, .&#163;136,569 over the expenditure; Victoria, &#163;69,181 over expenditure; Queensland, &#163;49,983 under expenditure; South Australia, .&#163;47,464 over expenditure; Western Australia, &#163;40,363 under expenditure; and Tasmania, &#163;1,393 over expenditure. The net receipts over expenditure were &#163;164,261, or nearly sufficient, after charging to expenditure the full cost of new works and buildings constructed during the financial year, to provide for interest at the rate of 3 per cent, on the estimated value of transferred properties of the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department. That is an answer to those who make charges against the Department. </para>

            <para>. - I should like to know whether the statement we have just heard was made by the honorable member for EdenMonaro, as Minister of Trade and Customs, or whether there has been another shuffle of portfolios, and he has regained that of Postmaster-General ? As he is not Postmaster-General, I should like to know why the honorable gentleman who draws the salary of that office does not take up the responsibilities of the position? There has been undoubtedly a great increase in the demand for telephones, but the officials of the Telephone Department have not been increased proportionately. Consequently, although there are more telephone  subscribers now than there were some time ago, and a much larger revenue, the service is not so good sis it was. In fact, it is out-of-date and inadequate, and subscribers often fling aside their instruments in disgust, finding it better after all to journey several miles to conduct their business directly.  The Telephone Department is altogether undermanned, and requires reorganization. I should like to know whether the &#163;500 set down for the purchase of telephone lines and instruments held by subscribers under the &#34; purchase &#34; system is large enough to enable the Department to acquire these telephones. As to what has been said about the flat-rate system, in my opinion the statement of the Chamber of Commerce that the daily telephone calls average seventeen is incorrect. I know that the calls on my own telephone are much fewer. It is the merchants of Sydney and the large business houses who get most out of the telephone system. If every one were charged for the service he gets, some of those who are now paying &#163;100 a year would have to pay &#163;1,000, while others who pay &#163;10 or &#163;12 a year would not have to pay more than &#163;5 a year. Not only are more telephone assistants wanted, lint the hours of the switchboard attendants should be reduced from six to four or five a day. Investigations made in England and in America show that the work is most trying, and often produces a form of hysteria, leading to lunacy, which is a serious thing for the future of the race. I hope that the Postmaster-General will take courage from the discussion in regard to the Sydney and Melbourne telephone line, and establish connexions between all the main cities of Australia. When at Port Darwin recently, I discovered that there was a copper wire right across the Continent, from that place to Adelaide. A great saving might be made by sending the telegraphic business from England and foreign countries across that line by telephone, instead of by the Morse telegraph instruments. Possibly it is not generally known that there is a copper wire there. I &#34;should like to see the charge on the Sydney and Melbourne line reduced, so that it may be more largely used, and a bigger return obtained. The outlay . I regard as a mere bagatelle in comparison with the conveniences afforded. As to the facilities to be afforded to the press, I think that it is time that the Government considered the whole subject of press concessions. It must be remembered that the press is a commercial concern. Newspaper proprietors charge very highly for the advertisements which they publish, and supply news only to induce the public to buy their newspapers. It is a business concern out of which immense sums are made. There is no reason why these great facilities and reductions should be given, to the press. </para>

            <para>.- In New South Wales, Victoria, and elsewhere there has been a very large increase in the number of cases of influenza. It seems to be synchronous with the increase in the use of the public telephone. There is an impression prevailing that the telephone receivers are largely responsible for spreading the disease. What I wish to elicit from the Postmaster-General is whether there is any systematic inspection and disinfection of the receivers, and if not whether he will give an instruction to that effect ? </para>

            <para>. - I desire to refer to the matter of telephonic connexions. As I inaugurated the first long-distance telephones in New South Wales, I am not likely to make any quarrel about the connexion between Melbourne and Sydney. It was a step in the right direction, and I hope that we shall soonsee a net- work of these wires established round Australia. I believe that nothing would contribute more to the development of good feeling between the States than the connexion of all the large cities by telephone. The sooner it comes about the better. In my judgment, the connexions will all pay very speedily. I know of no more profitable undertaking than the construction of long-distance telephones. At the beginning of all these undertakings, there is a great deal of nervousness. If the facilities are provided, they will be used by the public - that public which has been described to-night as a gang who go about robbing the community. I was surprised to hear the honorable member for Coolgardie indulging in such language. </para>

          <para>Mr.JOSEPH COOK. - I haveyet to learn that because a man tries to get a cheap service, he is, therefore, a robber. Those, however, are the ethics of the honorable member and those who agree with him. It is ridiculous to hear them always tilting in this way at an honest trader, who adds to the advantage of the community by the distribution of useful goods. It is farcical forany one to suppose that he is necessarily a robber. </para>

              <para>- No doubt that is a very good sentiment, but I suspect that it is not new.. I fancy that it smells of the Gwydir bush. I think that there is very great room for improvement in the working of the telephone connexion between Sydney and Melbourne. I have spoken over the line twice, and at neither time has the effort been a success. On the first occasion I had to ask the Minister to try to ring up the gentleman whom I wanted, but he could not make any sense out of the sound, while we could hear everything which went on in the office in Sydney, so distinct and clear is the connexion. In my judgment it is a splendid success as between the two cities, but the moment one gets to Sydney the whole advantage ceases. Between Sydney and Parramatta the world is a blank so far as the telephone is concerned. For the last two years it has been almost impossible to get a proper connexion between those two places. It is about the worst line I know of. Improvement is constantly promised. I hope that it will not be long before the service on that line is improved. That leads me to refer to the small amount which is provided on these Estimates towards the establishment of metallic circuits in connexion with the telephone system. </para>

              <para>- In my opinion these are the most important items in the Estimates. There will be no good done to the telephone service until we have installed a complete metallic system. The sooner that is done the better. We are asked to vote only &#163;5,500 - exactly the same amount as last year - in connexion with the institution of a metallic circuit in New South Wales, &#39; so as to stop the cross-firing on the. lines. I notice that last year the whole of the vote was not applied to that most&#39; important work. This is a matter of prime importance. It is more important than any other question concerned with these Estimates. </para>

              <para>- Of course it would, but my complaint is that no great effort is being made to do the work. Sums like &#163;40,000 or &#163;50,000 are applied to other requirements, and only &#163;5,500 is devoted to this most important matter. I find that while last year &#163;5,500 was set down on the Estimates only &#163;4,865 was spent. I should like to see .five or six times as much money, devoted to the purpose. It would pay the Department to do the work in a thorough fashion. Numbers of people at present will not be bothered with the telephone, so troublesome is it to get connected, and to carry on a satisfactory conversation. </para>

              <para>- In many cases it is not. A little while  ago  I had serious thoughts of having my telephone &#39; removed from my house altogether, because it caused a great deal more bother than it is worth. That is the experience of numbers of people who have telephones on the congested lines of our large cities. The defect can be remedied by the expenditure of a little money, and the outlay would pay in the end. The more valuable the service is made the more profitable it will be. But just at present it seems to be the policy of. the Department to discourage improvements. I do not know why. We are continually told that &#34; such and such a thing cannot&#39; be done.&#34; For instance, in all the States people have to wait weeks and weeks before they can be connected with the telephone system, after making application. That kind of thing has been going on for ten years, and it shows a singular want of foresight on the part of the officers of the Department, that such inconvenient delays should be tolerated by them. I trust that the Minister will see that a very much larger expenditure is provided for on account of the metallic circuit. The sooner we put an end to the present system the better it will be for every one. There is only one wa.v out of the difficulty, and that is to give each subscriber a complete and independent connexion. </para>

          </quote>
          <para>I cannot understand the principle upon which our telephone system is conducted. The ex-Postmaster-General a little while ago remarked that to every regulation there is an exception. In.niv electorate there is a telephone line on which an exception might very well be made. Some time ago I  asked  the Postmaster-General if he could see his way to reduce the charges made for telephone conversations over the trunk line between West Maitland and Sydney. The reply was that the honorable gentleman would look into the subject, and that he hoped- at an early date to be able to reduce the charges on some of the. trunk lines. But what was my surprise when I found that instead of the charge on this particular line being reduced, an increase was actually made. The strange circumstance was, however, that the charge on a portion of the line between West Maitland arid Newcastle was reduced by 50 per cent. When the line was opened a great deal of fuss was made about it, and citizens were asked to .plank down their- sovereigns to guarantee it against loss. But within three years the business has increased three-fold. It is now one of the best paying lines in the Commonwealth. The charge for a conversation between Maitland and Sydney is rs.  10d.  for three minutes. A large number of business men in the district feel this charge very keenly, and if the Seat of Government were within easier reach, I am sure that they would form an influential deputation to wait upon the PostmasterGeneral. Unfortunately, situated as they are, it is impossible for them to secure an interview with him. The honorable gentleman would be doing no more than justice iT he could see his way to reduce the charge from is.  10d.  to is. 6d. I have asked for the production of the papers in connexion with the matter. </para>

              <para>- I am sorry if I have such a fierce and hostile aspect as to lead the Minister to think I am attacking him. I am simply pleading with him on behalf of people who are put to considerable inconvenience by the present  system.  There are many other matters to which I should like to refer, but, out of respect to the Minister, I shall confine myself to this one. I remind him that the Sydney-Maitland line is now a paying undertaking. Sometimes, indeed, one has to wait half-an-hour to obtain a conversation. There ought to be three lines instead of one, and if there were three, they would all pay. </para>

            <para>.- There does not seem to have been due occasion for the rather windy ebullition of the Minister of Trade and Customs just now. Nothing that I said warranted such a, declaratory explosion, unless, indeed, the honorable gentleman desired to imitate the bad. example recently set him by an erstwhile colleague. In the few remarks which I made upon the long-distance telephone line, I do not recollect having mentioned the Minister at all. I did not hold him responsible for what had been done in that connexion. I merely referred to the Government. I included the whole Administration, so that why he should have taken my criticism entirely to himself passes my comprehension. Had I desired to attack him, surely he has provided me with ample ground. Had I wished to hold him up to public opprobrium, or to expose him to general ridicule, I need only have cited his monumental incompetency in connexion with the mail contract. But I remained absolutely silent upon that subject, which was the most shocking example of incapable administration this country has ever had presented to it. I make that observation merely with a view of showing that, had I wanted to attack the Minister of Trade and Customs, I have had plenty of scope to do it. But, as a matter of fact, when I was referring to the inertness of the Government in connexion with the telephone between Sydney and Melbourne, I was not thinking of him.  His  self-delusions should not overflow into the belief that he ever has occupied, or ever can occupy, a large place in die estimation of thoughtful . men. It would admittedly be difficult for any one to frame an attack on him as the advocate of any great principle, or the creator of any policy of high importance. No one can recall any display of constructive ability on his part. Hence, any attack on him must be based on his failure, as in the mail contract, &#39;to rise to the level of hisopportunities, and his neglect to adequately safeguard the great interests which, even&#39; as a subordinate Minister, are unhappily committed to his charge. It is unfortunate that, despite a diligent search, the record of his undertaking that not less than 6s. would be charged for each conversation over this line, cannot be found in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> As far as my memory serves me, he distinctly assured honorable members that  a payable rate would be charged, and that no reduction would be made. He now declares that what he said was that not more than 6s. for a three-minutes&#39; conversation would be charged - thus leaving it open to him to make a lower charge. I certainly could not see daylight through the extraordinary mass of figures with which he favoured us, and the confusion into which he threw everybody justifies the contention  t  of the honorable member for Kooyong that a proper balance-sheet ought to be pre- sented of the three great services carried on by this Department. I repeat that the Government ran away from their decision in regard to toll telephones. They ran away from it because of the agitation and clamour of a powerful section of the community in Sydney and Melbourne, backed up or led by the newspapers. There is not the slightest doubt about that. Nobody who has taken the trouble to read the newspapers even casually can entertain the slightest doubt that the Government were absolutely forced to recede from- the attitude which they originally took up. owing to the pressure brought to bear upon them by interested newspapers and classes who utilize the telephone service to the fullest extent. </para>

A large number of subscribers are getting the use of telephones at a fixed rate per annum, and are using the service to a much greater extent than are those who are under the toll system. The existing system is absolutely indefensible. I trust that this little episode will not be forgotten by the Minister of Trade and Customs.

But I may tell him of one thing which I did, and which perhaps he would not do under the circumstances. I saw that the organizations of employes were recognised by the Department - they had not previously been recognised - and that other reforms were instituted, which I did not trumpet forth in the press, as some Ministers since have done. My criticism of the Government was not unduly hostile or unfair. It did not exceed what, in the judgment of all impartial persons, their timorous conduct called for. It in no way warranted the bumptious irrelevancies of the Minister of Trade and Customs, who may feel perfectly assured that any repetition of vituperation will be repaid with compound interest. </para>

I think, in fairness to myself, that I should be permitted to make an answer to the charges levelled against me. Whatever position I may hold in Parliament, or on whichever side of the House I may sit, Ishall not allow statements against me to go unchallenged. In my statements concerning the Inter-State telephone, I stated, to the best of my recollection, that the charge should not exceed 6s. The initiation of the trunk telephone is not my work, but that of the ex-member for Macquarie, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sydney</inline> Smith, who is entitled to all the credit.I simply took the work up and carried it out to the best of my ability. I hope I have put this matter right in the eyes of honorable members. </para>

            <para>.- I desire once more to remind the PostmasterGeneral that Queensland is a scattered country, and to express the hope that where lines are already in existence, small agricultural settlements will have the advantage of telephonic communication. I have made a similar request on several occasions, but have always been met with official reports to the effect that the communication was not necessary. In one or two instances, where a line already passes through a district, the residents themselves have offered to provide and work the system free of charge to the Department; but that offer has also been refused on the same ground. I think some consideration should be shown to the people in these country districts, when the only cost would be that of, perhaps 50s., for the installation of the instrument. There is no doubt that telephonic communication in places which are far removed from centres of civilization, would be a great boon. My sympathies are with the Postmaster-General in the difficulties he has to contend with in connexion with the telephone branch of the service ; but I hope every effort will be made to popularize the system, and make it as cheap as possible, so that people in outlying districts may be able to come into closer touch with each other. The larger towns are pretty well catered for in the shape of slot telephones, by means of which for a small charge of1d., communication may be had over a radius of twenty-five miles ; and I think some attention should be paid to the agricultural districts. </para>

            <para>.I think the Committee are entitled to more explicit information. I understand that tenders are to be invited, as the Acting Prime Minister was good enough to say, for the best system. Will the, honorable gentleman kindly tell us how the Department proposes to arrive at a knowledge of what is the best system ? He is aware that one company conducting wireless telegraphy went to heavy expense in establishing a station at Queenscliff, and another in Tasmania, and that they have been allowed to dismantle their plant. What I desire to know is whether the Postmaster-General expects the owners of other systems to come to Australia, and do as the Marconi Company did, namely, give a demonstrationat a rumoured cost of from&#163;8,000 to  &#163;10,000,  or, whether officers will be sent to the old world where systems are in operation, the Government to act on a report obtained from those officers. This is rather an important matter. There is a good deal of difference of opinion as to the merits of the various systems. I know that very high claims are made on behalf of one system, which, according to the scientific journals, are scarcely  justified. It may be that the authors of those criticisms are hostile, or may have some interest in an opposing system. What I wish to ascertain is some information as to the method which the Government propose to adopt in order to give effect to. the expressed intention to select the best system. </para>

            <para>.- The Minister has stated that it is proposed to experiment with two systems of wireless telegraphy, but, as these systems have doubtless been tried in other parts of the world, there should surely be no necessity to experiment with them in Australia. Experts, who have a knowledge of the operation of those systems elsewhere, should be able to advise us as to which we should adopt. I think that in dealing with this matter, as in all business transactions, we shall find that the best course to follow is to deal with a reliable firm. It may be contended that, for one reason or another, the experiments now proposed may not be successful ; but I trust that the Ministry will not adopt the course proposed. If these experiments are to be proceeded with, it will be satisfactory to have a station established at King Island.; but I think that it would perhaps be more useful if the station were established at Flinders Island, which has been the scene of a great many shipwrecks, and is not at present connected with the mainland. A wireless telegraphy station established there wouldbe of very great advantage when  steamers trading in our waters are more generally fitted with the wireless telegraph apparatus, as I hope they will be at no very distant date. </para>

          <para>. - Honorable members are no doubt aware that it is the intention of the Government of New South Wales to appeal to the Privy Council against the decision of the High Court in the Baxter income tax case. As the issue involved in the matter isof great importance, I should like to know what steps, if any, the Government propose to take to have the Commonwealth view of the matter placed satisfactorily and fully before the Privy Council? </para>

          <para>. - This is a case in which an appeal is being made by the New South Wales Government. It is known as the Baxter case, and is one of great importance to the Commonwealth. The matter referred to by the honorable member for Gippsland has been considered, and the best counsel we could secure in Great Britain has been employed on behalf of the Government. Arrangements have been made for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Garran</inline> to go to England in connexion with the case. No one in the Commonwealth knows more about the matter than does <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Garran,</inline> andno one could give better instruction to counsel on the question involved. He will leave in a few days, and will be in England for about  . a  fortnight before the appeal is heard. </para>
