                        <para>- Is it a fact, as reported in the Sydney newspapers of Friday last, 30th August, that three carriers employed by a Government contractor named Sutton to assist in removing wire netting under instructions from the New South Wales Government have been peremptorily ordered by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Baxter,</inline> Acting Comptroller for Customs, to return their licences, and show cause why they should not be cancelled? Was this high-handed proceeding authorized or approved by the Minister? As the carriers referred to were, according to the report, in no sense principals in the contract with the State Government. "and the withdrawal'., of 'their licences must seriously injure them in their carrying business, will the Minister- recall the order issued by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Baxter,</inline> until an inquiry has been held and an offence has been proven? </para>

If the honorable member will give notice of his question, I shall be pleased to answer it, and to give him any information that he may require. So far as I. am aware, no licences have been cancelled. </para>

In my opinion, it would be a good thing to distribute copies of the new Tariff throughout the country, so that the public might know exactly what the rates are, and be in a position to meet, those who have raised prices on goods on which duties have not been imposed or increased. It has been suggested to the Acting Prime Minister that we might distribute a number of copies of the Tariff,  and that one should be sent to any person desirous of obtaining a copy, on receipt of his application, accompanied with an addressed stamped wrapper. </para>

                            <para>Reference was made in the Federal Parliament two days ago to the fact that no duty has as yet been collected in Victoria on kerosene under the new Tariff. The manager of the Colonial Oil Company <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. H. A. Forrest)</inline> remarks, however, that it has paid over £3,000 in Adelaide and over £1,000  in Brisbane. With regard to stocks, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Forrest</inline> doubts whether there was three months' supply of American tinned and cased oil and Asiatic bulk oil combined in. Australia on 8th August, when the Budget Speech was delivered. The Colonial Oil Company had about two and half months' supply on hand, which was about half the stock usually carried, and to ask whether that amount of duty has been paid on kerosene in Adelaide and Brisbane? </para>

                                <para>- The statement I made the other day was in reply to an allegation that the price of kerosene oil had been raised in Victoria. From the Customs House I ascertained that no duty had been paid in Victoria since the introduction of the new Tariff, and, consequently, I was at a loss to understand how persons here could claim that in charging the extra price they were simply passing on the duty. As regards what payments have been made in other States, I have no knowledge, but I shall be glad to ascertain the amount, and let the honorable member know. </para>

I ask the Minister whether he will take the matter into consideration, so that business may not be impeded by the action of the Department, owing to the mistake to which I refer. </para>

                        <para>- It has been announced by the Premier of Queensland, that he proposes at the time of the next Federal elections, to take a referendum of the State on the subject of Scripture education, and that the Premier of Victoria, if a referendum Bill is passed through the State .Parliament, will propose a similar referendum. Does the Acting Prime Minister think it right that sectarian issues should be permitted to enter into Federal politics, as they necessarily must if, at the time of the Federal elections, a referendum' is taken in regard to the teaching of Scripture by the State? </para>

                        <para>- Some time since the Postmaster-General entered into negotiations with the shipping companies trading on the north-west coast of Western Australia for the carriage of mails. It was understood at the time that an arrangement would be made with those companies in regard to the rates and fares to be charged on that coast. But it appears that a contract has been entered into, and that no appreciable difference has been made in that regard. I, therefore, ask the Minister whether he can see his way to lay upon the table the correspondence with the shipping companies, so that it may be perused by honorable members? </para>

                        <para>.- The Acting Prime Minister to-day acted wisely in refusing to consent to a proposal that would have interfered with the progress qf this debate and have delayed the settlement of the Tariff. I hope that we shall subordinate everything to the consideration that it is of the utmost importance that the Tariff should be disposed of with the least possible delay. It is for that reason that I do not propose "this afternoon to occupy the attention of honorable members at any great length. I feel that, at the outset, it is my duty to accentuate the point which the honorable member for Flinders made in the course of his forcible speech last week, when he said that the circumstances under which we were called upon to proceed with this debate were most unsatisfactory. We have now before us one of the most important Budget statements that it has been our duty to consider. The first submitted to the Parliament was one which involved speculation and doubt, for at the time we were confronted with the duty of harmonizing the various Tariffs of the six States, whilst in dealing with later Budgets we had not that fuller experience that we now possess of the working of the Federal machine. This is the first occasion on which we have had presented to us a Budget which foreshadows a time when we may not be able to meet the just demands upon the Commonwealth exchequer. It is quite clear that under existing circumstances we shall not have at our disposal anything like the revenue necessary to accomplish the various objects and undertakings for which Federation was established.  My honorable friends of the Labour Party may not view the situation with the same concern and dismay that I and others do, because such a shortage might lead to resort being had to a means of raising revenue which is one of the planks of their platform. I arn strongly of opinion that if the Commonwealth Parliament enters upon a system of direct taxation, it will assume a serious responsibility, and, in my judgment, break the whole spirit of the Federal compact. I hold very strongly that the intention was that- the power to impose direct taxation should be exercised by the Commonwealth only in a national emergency. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know what the right honorable member said on that occasion. What I am putting before the Committee comes off my own bat. I am not endeavouring to repeat the views of anybody else, and I ask honorable members to permit me to develop my speech in my own way. I do not think that any Budget statement has been submitted to us under conditions so unsatisfactory as those associated with that now before us. We have had from the Government no indication as to what are their intentions with reference to the carrying out of their programme, having regard to the fact that they have only a small margin to work upon. It is unfortunate that we should have had a joint submission of the Budget and the Tariff, but probably the Treasurer found that it would be impossible to dissociate them. In view of figures which I shall presently put before the Committee, it is of the utmost importance that honorable members should have their attention drawn to the fact that we are rapidly approaching a time when we shall exhaust the revenue, which, under present conditions, is at the command of the Commonwealth. The electors of Australia must recognise that if we are to fulfil the purposes and objects for which the Commonwealth "was established, there must be some readjustment of our present financial relations with the States. Otherwise we shall have to resort to the process of direct taxation, which, in my opinion, would be not only unfortunate for the Commonwealth, but a source of constant irritation between the Federal Government and the States. It would be more fruitful of discontent, and possibly of disruption, than any other policy which we could pursue. The power to levy Customs and Excise duties was intrusted exclusively to the Federal Parliament. No State was left with any power to derive revenue directly or indirectly from/ that source. Consequently, the Commonwealth became possessed of all possible Customs and Excise revenue to be raised in Australia. When we turn back to the debates which took place in the various Conventions from which the Constitution emanated, we must be struck with the fact that much discussion centred around the question of how the apportionment of revenue derived from Customs and Excise was to be adjusted, so as not to interfere unduly with the revenues of the States. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Braddon devised a method of dealing with that difficulty which has been shown to possess merits even greater than were originally acknowledged. My honorable friend, the member for Flinders, has drawn attention to the fact that, having regard to the arbitrary apportionment of at least three-fourths Customs and Excise revenue to the States, we are justified in assuming that the framers of the Constitution recognised that the amount of money represented by that proportion was a;t the time nearly equivalent to the amount of interest which had to be paid by the States upon their debts. My honorable friend argued that we were, therefore, warranted in looking upon the three-fourths as the minimum amount which the 'States might reasonably expect to have returned to them. It will be remembered that, at the time of the establishment of Federation, the amount pf debt which might be taken over by the Commonwealth was £201,500,000. Debts which might subsequently be incurred by the States did not enter into the calculation. But I believe that, until some final and satisfactory adjustment is arrived at in connexion- with State and Federal finance, we ought, in any settlement we make, even at the end of 1910, to provide that the additional sum of over .£7,000,000 - representing 3J per cent, upon State borrowings at the establishment of the Constitution - should be ear-marked to the States for their benefit. There is no matter which demands more serious consideration than does our present financial position. It ought to have engaged the best attention of the Ministry, instead of being placed before us as though it was a matter about which honorable members might be left to wrangle as they pleased. Let me draw attention to the very great increase in our expenditure which has taken place since the Commonwealth has been in existence. The estimated expenditure for 1907-8 amounts to .£5,976,000. That represents an actual increase upon the expenditure for 1901-2 of .£2,035,000. In addition, I find that the estimated increase for the current .year, as compared with the expenditure for 1906-7, is ,£980,691. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable member desires that information, I have the whole of the figures relating to it in my possession. I may say that I have had a rather elaborate analysis of the whole position prepared. The information is contained in a large bundle of papers, with the details of which I shall not trouble the Committee. These papers, however, are at the service of any honorable member who desires to peruse them. I say, with all respect to the able and efficient officers in the Treasury Department, that "the manner in which some of these figures are presented should be more in accordance with the system with which we are familiar in commercial offices. I wish to show the position of the. Commonwealth from the stand-point of the estimated revenue and expenditure for the current year. The information which I have obtained is in the form of a table, which I ask may be published in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> for future reference, so that honorable members may be enabled to ascertain our exact position by simply referring to it and without the necessity for an examination of other parts of the Budget statement. The table.- is as follows - </para>

                            <para>- Yes. The expenditure upon the Defence Department aggregates £916,206, less receipts - which are derived chiefly from rents - amounting to £6,000; "Miscellaneous" involves an expenditure of £25,000, and Quarantine of £8,000 ; the total of other expenditure is £1,090,780. Then the construction of new works represents an expenditure of £817,874, making a total of £2,851,860, leaving us a balance of £103,992, which represents the margin available for new purposes of the Commonwealth. I am sure that honorable members must regard that situation as one demanding their serious attention. If we avail ourselves of other powers which we possess - such as the power of direct taxation - our action will probably be fraught with serious consequences to the Commonwealth and to the States. But I venture to think that the expectations of the Treasurer will not be realized. The late Treasurer took what we thought at the time was a very optimistic view of the financial outlook, but I am glad to say that his expectations were fully realized.  His  estimate was based upon the requirements of an estimated population of 4,121,000. The estimate of revenue from Customs and Excise for 1907-8 is based on an estimated population of 4,190,000, or an increase of 69,000 people. It amounts to £10,509,000, or an increase of , £1,409,000, equal to over £20 per head of the increase in population. Averaged over the whole population, the estimate of revenue for the last financial year was £2 4s. 2d. per head, while that for the current year is £2 ros. 2d. per head, or an additional 6s. per head for every man, woman, and child in the Commonwealth. The estimate for 1906-7 of <inline font-style="italic">Customs</inline> revenue only - eliminating sugar as a disturbing element, to which I shall presently refer - was £7,051,000. The actual revenue received was £7,500,368, or an increase over the estimate of £449,368. That was equal to an increase of 6.37 per cent. The estimated Customs revenue only for 1907-8 is £8,161,000, or £1,110,000 more than the estimate for the previous year. This, on the basis of a consumption equal to the estimated consumption of 1906-7, means an increase in the present duties of an average of 15.6 per cent. Or, if we take the consumption for this year as equal to the amount which actually paid duty last year, then the difference of £660,632 between the amount of £7,500,368 of duty actually paid last year, and the estimate of £8,161,000 to be received during the current year, is equivalent to an increase in the present duties of 8.8 per cent. There has not been in our past experience any increase of our consuming powers sufficient to justify the expectation that those high percentages will be realized. </para>

                            <para>- The figures I have given have been very carefully worked out. Let us turn now to the Post and Telegraph Department. A point which I have ventured to urge upon the consideration of the Department both last year and in previous years was that there should be a proper segregation of the three business accounts of the Department - the postal account, the telegraph account, and the telephone system account. Each of these is a separate entity of business in itself, and inasmuch as they do segregate the revenue of each branch, there ought to be no practical difficulty in ascertaining the details of the separate expenditures. If that were done, the result would really be instructive to the. House, and I think we should find that  we are deriving a very large revenue in-  deed, in fact, more than is at present supposed, from that public convenience, the telephone. It will be noted that the re-  venue from the Postal Department is estimated at £272,500 more than the estimate fnr last year, and only . £16,157less than was actually received last year, in spite of the fact that it is reckoned that £117,000 less will be received through the introduction of penny postage. This is equivalent to estimating that if the present rates were maintained £100,000 more would be received than last year. </para>

                            <para>-  I quite recognise that the amount of £117,000 is for only half a year, and that my honorable friend's estimate was for nine months, but even then I am not able to reconcile the two estimates. I must say that I prefer to accept the expectation of loss indicated by the late Treasurer. The estimate of revenue for the telegraph branch is ,£58,000 more than the estimate for last year, which is practically an increase of 10 per cent. The estimate of receipts from telephones shows an increase of £46,500' over last year's estimate, or an increase of 12 per cent. To cope with the anticipated increase of business, the strength of. the staff of the Department rises from 10,931 employe's to 11,606, or an increase of 675 hands, involving an estimated increase of salaries of £65,133. In addition, the general' expenditure ..is estimated at ,£93,943 more than last year's estimate, and £116,658 greater than last year's actual expenditure. Taken together, the figures I have given show an. actual increase of expenditure in the Department of £203,719 over last year. That is a serious factor, and supports me in the belief that the expectation of revenue of the Government will, from these. two Departments, not be realized. If I were not rather showing the position from an adverse point of view, I should have liked to give, at this stage, in connexion with the question of penny postage, some figures which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Henniker</inline> Heaton was good enough to supply me with the other day. I think, however, that it would be better to defer them until the item is under consideration. On these two Departments alone the surplus of the Government is entirely swept away. </para>

                            <para>- Of course if the proposal for penny postage does not pass this House, we shall have £^117,000 of additional revenue for six months, or a greater sum for twelve months. On defence, the estimate of expenditure is £916,000, being an increase of £61,000. In view of the complications which are taking place in the Pacific, in the shape of the new factor of a great American fleet entering that ocean, the advance which has taken place in China, and the position which has been occupied by Japan,, we are absolutely playing with the whole defence question if we suppose that an increase of £61,000 in expenditure will in any adequate degree meet the necessities of the situation. </para>

                            <para>- I shall deal with that matter in a few moments. I do not know whether it is expected that next year the Naval Agreement will "be cancelled, and that the £200,000, how spent annually under that agreement, will revert to revenue; but I earnestly hope that a strong, solid vote will be recorded against any proposition of the kind. ' If ever it were necessary to have the assistance of the British Fleet, it is necessary now; and the assistance is becoming more imperative in view of the fact that the theatre of international complication, and of naval trouble, must be in the Pacific. Are we in the self-sufficing position to provide whatever expenditure may be necessary in this connexion ? No policy has been enunciated by the Government ; on the contrary, the only policy of the Government - and it is one on which I am at strong divergence with the Prime Minister - seems to be a policy of surrender of the Naval Agreement, as indicated during his recent visit to England. I am perfectly sure that if a poll had been taken throughout the Commonwealth, the  Prime Minister would have received no support in the position he then assumed. </para>

                            <para>- The Government have no naval policy ; and the only financial policy which they seem to have is to impose high duties; that seems to be the beginning and end of the policy of the Government, apart altogether from revenue considerations. Honorable members in the Ministerial corner, however, have a distinct policy, and, though we may be opposed to that policy, I say all honour to them, because they know where they are from day to day. </para>

                            <para>- Well, it is inevitable that the time must arrive when the Commonwealth will have to take the only business course of borrowing, for the purpose of reproductive works. I admire the effort which has been made in some of the States to reduce their indebtedness out of the revenue derived from their various methods of taxation, but it is absolutely impossible to imagine that we shall be able to fulfil the purposes of Federation without eventually borrowing. </para>

                            <para>- No one desires more than myself to avoid entering upon a borrowing policy, and no one will analyze or criticise more keenly than myself any proposal to borrow ; but if we are to carry out all the objects favoured by honorable members in the Ministerial corner, borrowing will become a business necessity, or we must curtail the development policy of the Commonwealth. I should like to invite the attention of honorable members to the sugar industry, as there appears to be some misconception of our exact position. I have prepared a statement, in which I show what our financial position would be if we had not to pay the sugar bonus. That bonus was arranged for general purposes of policy, but had it been dealt with as a business undertaking, we should to-day, instead of a balance of  £103,992,  have had a balance of  £533,742  for this year - that is, if the bonus had ceased last year, even though it had been paid during the two previous years. For instance, the real excise, in my opinion, is  £173,000,  whereas' the excise actually collected was  , £746,000,  and the bounty paid was  £573,000,  the real excise being the difference between the two. That leaves us with  . £9,936,000,  and, with the ordinary amount from Customs and. other receipts, there is a balance of  . £533, 7 42.  If there had been no bonus, we should have been in a position to refund to the States that balance, instead of only  £103,992. </para>

                            <para>- I do not desire the excise to be taken off entirely, but to be reduced to such an amount as to represent the real excise, namely, the difference between the bonus and the excise now. collected. Leaving out detailed figures, with which I shall not trouble the Committee, I think it will be seen from the representations I have made, that on the Treasurer's anticipations we shall sustain a loss in Customs and Excise revenue and in connexion with the Postmaster - General's Department amounting to £123,256. In all the circumstances, therefore, it must be admitted that the honorable and learned member for Flinders last week outlined the financial position of the Commonwealth in a manner which demands the most .serious consideration and criticism of honorable members, if we are to establish confidence in our financial stability abroad. At the present time, I believe that from the financial stand-point the Commonwealth occupies a position abroad, which is not superior to that of any one of the larger States. It is my contention that we should occupy a much better position than we do at the present time, had it not been for certain legislation and certain misrepresentations of the Commonwealth published at Home. The duty is imposed upon us of seriously considering what remedies are available to establish the superior financial position of the Commonwealth. Some time ago I submitted a proposal for the transfer of the States debts. I gave it, as my opinion, that we should accept a lump sum of £200,000,000 as covering the debts to be transferred, and if we provided for an interest charge of 3J per cent, on that amount, we should practically carry out the idea to which the honorable member for Flinders gave prominence last week. I then suggested that it would be necessary for the Commonwealth Parliament to make provision for the return to the States annually of a fixed sum amounting to not less than £7,000,000, and I estimated that a further sum of £350,000 should be provided to meet the special necessities of Western Australia, because of the high consumption of dutiable goods per unit , in the population of that State. I find that if that idea had been carried out, the sum I have mentioned would have been very nearly met by the actual amount returned to the States at that time, viz., £7,039,199. I think it is essential that we should keep in mind the £201,580,185 of States debts as they existed at that time, and should regard the amount of the interest charge thereon, £7,254,948, as establishing the minimum amount which the States are entitled to expect shall be' returned to them. I quite recognise that the figures will have to be adjusted in making the returns on a different basis from that on which we are now making our returns. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, but I may say that I am not of that opinion now. I now believe that the adjustment of the finances under section 87 of the Constitution must be carried out irrespective of any consequential transfer of the States railways. The two things may be concurrent, and I should be glad if that could be arranged ; but the settlement of the financial position in 19 10 will have to be carried out quite irrespective of the other question to which I have referred, if the States do not themselves come together and make some proposals or overtures to the Federal Government. It has been a perfect mystery to me that the States Governments have not pressed the necessity for the adjustment of the finances more earnestly than they have done or are doing at the present time. If there is any friction between the Commonwealth and States authorities at the present time it is probably due to the manner in which the present Acting Prime Minister has flouted the Premiers' Conference held at Brisbane, the Prime Minister, and the right honorable member for Swan, in coming down to this House and saying that he was not going to agree to the arrangements arrived at with the Brisbane Conference, and making it plain that he preferred to take another course, with a view to hastening direct taxation. It is also a mystery to me that  any one holding so responsible a position as that which the Acting Prime Minister occupies at the present time should have allowed himself to take up a position of that kind. I think that perhaps we can best deal with the Tariff when we' are considering the detailed items, but it is only right that at this stage I should say exactly what my attitude in connexion with it will be. At' the late elections I made my position absolutely clear. The Prime Minister had said that he was in favour of scientific national protection!; scientific because of careful adjustment of the needs of each industry, and no more than is sufficient to meet its honorable needs. </para>

                            <para>- I know that the party to which my honorable friend belongs would like to raise revenue by other means, but, according to my view, our primary source of revenue- must be such duties. Then there is what I may call the humanitarian aspect of the Tariff, On every platform from which I have spoken, I have pledged myself to give consideration to the humanitarian point of view, a new element in connexion with Tariff proposals which I have not heard of as being considered in other parts of the world. In dealing with the Tariff, we must first of all remember the obligation to so adjust duties that we shall have sufficient revenue for the administration of the Commonwealth Departments, and be able to return to the States, as their three-fourths share, a sum not less than the annual interest of their public debts at the date of Federation. The observance of this obligation will make it impossible for us to impose prohibitive rates. We must also take into consideration what I have just referred to as the humanitarian point of view, that is, we must recognise that it is the desire of the public that the workmen employed in our manufacturing industries shall be well paid and humanely treated. But I. have always stated clearly and distinctly that prohibitive duties, that is duties which prevent reasonable competition, or impose undue or unnecessary, burdens on consumers, are opposed to the public interest, and that I shall not vote for them. It will be my endeavour to secure effective protection where a just demand has been made for it, but I shall see that consumers are not unduly interfered with, or made to bear unnecessarily heavy burdens, even to bolster up the great manufacturing industries of Australia. Moreover, I have publicly indicated' that I am in favour of preferential trade. I wish to see ultimately a union of the various parts of the Empire, under which reciprocal trading arrangements will be made. As for the proposals of the Government,- they must each be dealt with on its merits, but, speaking of them generally, I venture to regard them, having in view what was said by Ministers when in London, as farcical. However, I shall consider myself free to deal with them individually, because there may be items in regard to which a preference has been wisely proposed. My speech has occupied more time than I intended to take up, and I have not yet covered a tithe of the ground which I wish to cover, but, before  sitting down, I urge honorable members, both those who have recently taken their seats in this Chamber and those who were elected to the first- and second Parliaments, to resolve to do something towards placing the Commonwealth finances iri a sound position. It is idle to think that we can flout the opinion of the great commercial centres of the world. I speak with' some knowledge of the subject when I say that we should  make ourselves ridiculous in pretending to do so. Notwithstanding the enormous increase of wealth in Australia, we cannot regard this country as independent of the great financial, centres of the world. </para>

                            <para>- Whatever the Acting Prime ' Minister may have said before he went to London, I do not think that he is now of the opinion that Australia can be regarded as independent of the financial centres of the world. It is our duty, when proposals for expenditure are placed before us, to see what their effect will be upon our finances. We are to be asked to undertake serious obligations which may jeopardize our financial position, and injure our relations with the States. A dominating fault in connexion with this Legislature has been the too pressing desire to pass unnecessary legislation. We ought to realize that the legislation and development of this great Commonwealth must be a work of time, and that hasty action on our part will bring about adverse consequences. We have to recognise that in the individual States there are local interests, experiences, customs, and prejudices which the Commonwealth was not created to inflame or to continue. We, as representatives of the people, ought to endeavour to reduce the feeling of discontent and irritation. Unless we place the Commonwealth in a sound financial position, the causes of irritation will increase, and we shall find elements of destruction within ourselves.  .1  plead with my honorable friends opposite to pause. </para>

                            <para>- Unless the finances of the Commonwealth are placed on a sound basic principle disaster must follow. We have a magnificent heritage. I did propose to read some statements showing the magnificent development of our resources, irrespective of State or Commonwealth legislation, and the natural increase which has taken place, but I shall not weary honorable members by reading them. When I look at the figures which they contain, I find that the value of Australian products exported in 1901 was £47,741,776, and in 1906, £66,299,874/ showing an increase of. £18,558,098. The value of our imports and exports amounted last year to £114,467, 269 - the high water mark of our commercial relations - showing an increase of £22,337,086 since 1901. In every department of production we are advancing. In not one case has the result been due to any State or Commonwealth legislation, but to the efforts of the bone and sinew, the thought and judgment of our people. </para>

I plead with honorable members to be alive to the 'great trust which has been reposed in us, and to remember that before we follow any Ministry, they ought to come down with financial proposals which will be understandable. In view of the proceedings which have characterised the House during the session, and with a knowledge of the financial disabilities which exist, I contend that it is not fair or just for the Government to put before honorable members in an immature, ill-considered manner proposals for large expenditure. </para>

                        <para>. - I think that every honorable member will indorse the anxiety of the last  speaker  to see a system of sound finance established. But the whole question is, How are we to arrive at that result? From the speech of the honorable gentleman to-day, and also from the speech of the honorable member for Flinders last week, I gather that their view of sound finance is to plunge the Commonwealth into a policy of borrowing. If their speeches on the Budget indicate anything, they indicate that in their opinion this Parliament should abandon the policy which it established at the beginning of its existence, and that is, to live within our means. In its first session Parliament was asked to adopt a proposition to borrow  £1,000,000,  * It was resisted most strenuously by the leader of the Labour Party, opposed by a majority in the Chamber, and abandoned by the Government. Had we agreed to the policy which was then advocated, and which is now favoured by the honorable members for Kooyong and Flinders, by this time we should have ' borrowed  £2,500,000,  and the taxpayers would have been paying interest on that sum. Fortunately, we have been able to carry out all our work without resorting to the money market. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that it would have done so. I believe that had we initiated the policy of borrowing our loan expenditure would have amounted now to something like  £5,000,000.  Which is the sounder system of finance - that of the man who lives within his- means, or that of the individual who borrows ? The policy indicated in speeches delivered by honorable members in the Opposition corner is that of borrowing and booming, and we have also had an indication that in their opinion a reduction in the salaries of public servants is 'desirable. The speech made last week by the honorable member for Flinders indicated - if it showed anything at all - that, in his opinion, we were paying too much to our public servants, and that their salaries should be reduced.' It is well that the country should know that the policy of the Opposition corner is that of borrowing, booming, and sacking hands. </para>

                            <para>- I shall not deal further with that aspect of the question. I want to devote special attention to the Tariff. Honorable members appear to be practically unanimous on the point that the details of the Tariff should be left severely alone during this debate, and it has been said more than once that we shall be able to deal with them more satisfactorily later on. A singular feature of the debate is that so far we have not had one speech in support of the Tariff. When I first saw it I was amazed. I was under the impression that since the Commonwealth had incurred the expense incidental to the appointment of a Commission to investigate the working of the Tariff, the Government of the day, in bringing down the revision proposals, would, at"least, have had some regard to the recommendations of that industrious body, which devoted nearly three years to its work. The Government, however, have done nothing of the kind. They seem to have proceeded in haphazard fashion to frame a Tariff, adding  5  per cent, here, and  10  per cent, there, and taking various items off the free list. They do not' appear to have considered the probable effect of a Tariff so framed. That, I am sure, is the opinion of the public generally, for neither protectionists nor free-traders are satisfied with the Government proposals. The old Tariff was more acceptable than is the present one to a number of protected industries. Another point to be remembered is that, whilst the' duties under it in some cases were high, and in others fairly substantial, there was a distinct free list. In the Tariff now before us, however, raw materials are taxed to such .an extent that the increased protection of  15  per cent, given in many cases to industries in which those raw materials are used is not likely to be of any advantage to them. The honorable member for Kooyong expressed the view that the Government would not secure from this Tariff as much revenue as they estimated. I have no hesitation in saying that, if it be passed in its present form, the revenue from it during the first, or at all events the second, year of its operation will be at least  £[1,000,000  in excess of that estimated by the Treasurer. </para>

                            <para>- I venture to say that it will lead to an increase of nearly  £[2,000,000.  Every one associated with our manufacturing industries knows that to-day they are rushed with work. In a vast majority of cases orders have to be booked some time ahead, and thus there is every reason to believe that, although heavy duties have been imposed on many manufactures, enormous quantities of such goods must continue to be imported. The Tariff has been designed especially to suit the interests of Victoria. It is not by any means an Australian Tariff. The framers of it do not appear to have taken into consideration the ramifications of industry and the difficulties which those engaged in our primary industries have to face. They are penalized in every direction to such an extent that, unless the Tariff be considerably modified, it will very seriously affect them. Before proceeding to deal with the details qf the Tariff, I, wish for a moment to discuss the question of revenue. It is estimated that we shall receive this year from all sources a revenue of £13, 745, 200, or an increase of £912,934 as compared with the returns for last year. Notwithstanding this estimated increase, however, the outlook for the States is by no means satisfactory. The people of Australia, according to the Treasurer's estimate, are to be taxed to the extent of nearly £1,000, 000, although, in my opinion, the proposed taxation will nearly double that amount. But this year the surplus revenue returned to the States will be only £103,992, as compared with .£805,766 returned to them last year, and of that amount South Australia will receive only ,£239. In connexion with the consideration of these figures, the question of interest on the transferred buildings is naturally brought to mind. I know that it is argued - and up to a certain point it can be argued with a good deal of force - that the payment for such buildings as post and telegraph offices, and defence works by the Commonwealth would te a mere bookkeeping entry ; that if the Commonwealth were to pay the States Governments at a valuation, or were to take over from them a proportion of their debt equivalent to the value of the buildings, and pay the interest - it would simply be like the taking of money out of one pocket and putting it into another. But that is only true until the Commonwealth "arrives at what may be called the vanishing point in respect to the surplus revenue which it returns to the States ; and, so far as South Australia is concerned, the Surplus is reaching vanishing point this year, inasmuch as it is estimated that that State will receive only £239 more than she is entitled to under the Braddon section. So long as the surplus returned to the States was large, it was immaterial whether the Commonwealth paid for the transferred buildings or the States paid the interest on them out of the surplus which the Commonwealth handed over. But the moment the surplus vanishes, we shall be in this position. The States will not receive any more than the three-fourths to which they are entitled under the Constitution, but, at the same time, they will have to pay the interest on money represented by the transferred buildings which the Commonwealth holds. Now, that is not a proper position in which to put the States. Some effort should be made to bring about a satisfactory arrangement. It is singular that the Commonwealth, under different Governments, should have been in existence for seven years, and should have as yet failed to arrive at a valuation on account of the transferred properties. I do not know the cause of the delay, but it is astonishing that a fair estimate has not yet been determined. It has been recently stated by a Minister that it is expected, at an early date, to arrive at a fair valuation. But, in the meantime, the Commonwealth has the use of the buildings. We have arrived at the stage when we ought to pay to the States interest on the capital thus represented. Otherwise, the States will have to fall back upon local taxation for the purpose of making up the loss. I do not think it is fair that they should be put in that position. If the Government carries its penny postage proposal, it must lead to an enhanced expenditure on account of the Post and Telegraph Department. Penny postage would involve a greater volume of correspondence. Whether the additional revenue would make up the loss occasioned by the reduction of the rate from 2d. to id. .is a matter about which  1  have  grave doubts. At any rate, the loss could not be made up for a considerable time. The increased volume of correspondence would involve additional expenditure for the carriage and delivery of mails over this vast continent. Consequently, we have to anticipate diminished revenue and increased expenditure if the Government proposals are carried. Personally, I am not_ in favour of penny postage, until it can be demonstrated that the receipts will be nearer to the expenditure than the information now before us discloses. Any Post Office deficiency in consequence of the introduction of penny postage would have to be made up by the community at large, and not by the people who would derive the chief benefit from the reduction. </para>

                            <para>- My State will get this year £239 above the three-fourths due to it, with which to pay interest on buildings transferred to the Commonwealth. That amount is obviously insufficient. It is problematical whether the volume of increased correspondence would, for a considerable time, reach the point when there would be a revenue equivalent to the additional expenditure. The reduction of the postage rate would mean hundreds of thousands of pounds to business men, but to the ordinary working man and the farmer the benefit would be a mere bagatelle. If any loss has to be made up the Commonwealth Government will fall back upon the Customs House, and the clerk in an office will have to pay as much towards making up the deficiency as the man who perhaps pockets thousands of pounds as a direct result of penny postage. Therefore, until it can be demonstrated that the receipts will approximate to the expenditure, I shall vote against the proposals of the Government. I have a word or two to say ora preferential trade. The members of the Government must not take to heart what I intend to say, but the more I study the preference proposals of the Ministry the more I am satisfied that they are a delusion and a sham. While they pretend to grant a preference to Great Britain, as compared with foreign powers, the Government have, under the Tariff, struck  the United Kingdom a more severe blow in the matter of trade than it has received for many years. I will prove that statement from the schedule of duties before us. I have gone to some trouble to find out the origin of the imports which I shall mention. Take apparel and attire, woollens. Last year we imported to the value of £1,437.000. Of this amount £1,083,000 was imported from the United Kingdom. The Government propose to increase the duty on those imports from 25 per cent, to 40 per cent., and to raise the duty against imports from foreign countries to 45 per cent. In other words, it is proposed to give the United Kingdom an advantage of 5 per cent., as compared with foreign powers, but to increase the duty against Great Britain by 15 per cent. Next, take woollen piece-goods, n.e.i. The imports last year amounted to £1,900,000, of which quantity .£1,590,241 came from the  United Kingdom. The Government propose to increase the Tariff against those goods from 15 to 30 per cent. In other words, there is a proposed increase amounting to 100 per cent. in. the duty against the goods of the United Kingdom, although Great Britain is given a preference of only 5 per cent, over foreign imports. Let me take the item of cotton and linen piece goods. Last year the importations under this heading were valued at £3,209,000, of which <inline font-style="italic">£3,0^,517</inline> worth came from the United Kingdom. In this instance, the duties have been increased from 5 and 10 to 25 per cent., notwithstanding that under the old Tariff a large quantity of cotton goods was upon the free list. In respect of flannels the imports last year were valued at £52,000, of which £[42,000 worth came from the United Kingdom. Yet the duty upon these goods has been increased from 15 to 30 per cent. The importations of flannelette last year aggregated a value of £253,000, of which! £203,000 worth were of British origin. In this instance, the duty has been increased from 15 to 30 per cent. - an advance of 100 per cent, upon the original rate of duty. Last year the importations of coatings, vestings, and trouserings, were .valued at £[92,000, of which £72,000 worth came from the United Kingdom. Here again the duty, has been increased from 15 to 30 per cent. In the matter of trimmings, mantles, dress, bonnets, &amp;c, the total imports last year were valued at £282,000 of which £111,000 worth came from the United Kingdom: Yet the duty upon these articles has been increased from 15 to 20 per cent. The total imports of carpets and carpetings last year were valued at £124,000, of which £115,000 worth were of British manufacture. The duty upon these materials has also been increased. Last year, the importations of floorcloths, coverings, &amp;c, were valued at £319,894, of which £304,000 worth came from the </para>

                    <para class="block">United Kingdom. Yet the Government (have increased the duty upon these articles from 15 to 30 per cent. Cannot honor - able members see that under this Tariff we shall obtain an enormously increased revenue? Where are the industries in Australia to cope with such a great volume of trade? I say that even if higher duties increased the local output to some extent a very much larger revenue must be collected, at any rate, for a time. The total imports last year of earthenware, brownware, and stoneware were valued at £143,582, of which £116,000 worth came from the United Kingdom. Upon these articles the duty has been increased from 20 to 30 per cent, in the case of British manufactures, and to 35 per cent, in the case of goods of foreign origin. Last year, the imports of galvanized iron, plate and sheet, represented a value of ^£1,245,211, of which- the United Kingdom supplied £1,028,806. The duty upon this material has been increased from 15s. per ton to 20 and 25 per cent, in the case of British! and foreign goods, respectively, which represents an advance in the rate of duty of more than 100 per cent. A similar remark is applicable to galvanized - that is, plain sheet iron, not corrugated - the importations of which last year were valued at £200,000, of which £111,000 worth came from the United Kingdom. Upon this line, which was formerly free, -duties' of 15 and 20 per cent, respectively have been imposed in respect of British and foreign goods. These materials are in every day use, and must continue to be imported for a considerable time, despite any duty that may be levied upon them. Under the heading of socks and stockings, I find that the imports last year were valued at £311,412, of which £305, 000 worth came from the United Kingdom. Yet the duty in respect of these articles has been increased from 25 to 30 per cent. The imports, of towels, and handkerchiefs, cotton and linen last year aggregated a value of £199,000 of which the United Kingdom supplied £180,724. Here again the duty has been increased. In the case of blankets and blanketing, the old rate of duty has been advanced from 15 to 30 per cent, notwithstanding that of the £53,000 worth imported -last year £49,000 worth were of British origin. I come now to a number of other instances which will serve to show the enormity of the imposts which are being levied upon 'British goods. </para>
                    <para class="block">Last year, the total imports of portable and traction engines were valued at £108,000 of which £87,000 worth came from the United Kingdom. Yet the duty upon these engines has been increased 25 to 30 per cent. Last year the total importation of the parts of these engines was valued at £628,301, of which the United Kingdom supplied £395,102. In respect of these parts, the duty has been increased from 12J per cent, to 25 per cent. in. the case of British goods, and 30 per cent, in the case of the foreigner. I now come to that most useful article wire-netting. Last year, the total imports were valued at £521,788, of which the United Kingdom supplied £378,847 worth. Under the old Tariff, this commodity was free, but under the present Tariff, it is dutiable at 25 per cent, in the case of British goods, and 30 per cent, in the case of goods of foreign origin. Surely the sham nature of the preference proposals of the Government is demonstrated by these figures? Whilst they have imposed an additional 5 per cent, upon metals of foreign manufacture, they have advanced the duty upon metals from Great Britain by five times that amount. I say that there is more cant talked about extending a preference to the goods of the mother country than there is about any other political question. The Australian manufacturer does, not care a tinker's curse where these goods come from. If they are a menace to his trade, he desires that protective duties shall be levied upon them. He is equally anxious that all his raw material should be placed upon the free list. Every manufacturer in short, is a free-trader so far as his raw material is concerned, but a protectionist in the matter of everything that he desires to sell. Let us assume that the present duty upon wire-netting had been operative last year. There is only one manufactory of wire-netting in Australia, and the owners of it have considerably more to do now than they can cope with. Although there has been a vast increase in the duty, they have kept all the time within a margin of the top price, although they have a big market in Australia for their product. I refer to Lysaght Brothers, of New South Wales. </para>

                            <para>- I have just said so. I venture to say that even if this extra duty had been imposed before, the wire-netting I am speaking of must have come  in. I want to show what this increased duty means to the farmer - the primary producer, the man who has to battle in the back country against rabbits, and very often ' must take inferior land because he cannot get any better. He has quite enough of hard times to contend with without being taxed as he will be under this proposition. Assuming that we import this year as much wire-netting as we imported last year from the United Kingdom, the duty of 25 per cent, proposed by the Government on manufactures from the United Kingdom would represent £94,711. If we take the duty of 30 per cent, on the wire-netting to the value of £142,943 which came from foreign parts, the receipts would amount to £42,882. </para>

                            <para>- No. The total duty on last year's imports on the basis of the new duties proposed would have been £137,593. Recently a question was put in the Senate as to the number of hands employed in the wire-netting industry in Australia. The answer was that 656 hands were employed, not only in wire-netting, but in wire-mattress making, bird-cage making, wire-nail making, and a number of minor industries of a similar nature. Consequently, 656 hands represent the whole of the men and boys in the wire-working industry in Australia. Assuming that the whole of them were engaged in the manufacture of wire- netting, this impost on the unfortunate farmer, who has to go out into the back-blocks, and battle against vermin, is equivalent to the payment of a bonus of £209 14s. per head per year for every man and boy engaged in those establishments in the making of nails, bird-cages, wire mattresses, and wire-netting. Is this House going to tolerate such a thing? Are we going to allow our pioneers to be plundered in this way? If I base my calculation on the actual basis of the hands employed in the manufacture of wire-netting only - probably about half of the total hands in the .wire-working industry - that amount of duty is equivalent to a bonus of something like £456 per year for every man and boy employed. And for what? For an industry that has already more work than it can cope with, that cannot supply all the orders now forwarded, and that was built up without a duty at all. The  Chairman  of the Tariff Commission himself said on the floor of this House that this duty was recommended, not because it was asked for, or because of any special merits as disclosed by the evidence, but, as he said, " because if we did not put it on, it would be complained that we had . left the New  South Wales industry out of consideration." </para>

                            <para>- I venture to say that the output will increase on that of last year. Representing, as I do, a district where you might as well throw the wheat into the sea as attempt to grow it without using wire-netting, I. say without .hesitation that, having to buy wire-netting, even at first cost, means a tax on the farmer equivalent to from 2d. to 3d. an acre rent, in order to keep the vermin out. On top of that, the Government want to load him up with these duties of 25 per cent, and 30 per cent., or an equivalent of £137,000 to be paid by the farming community. It is one of the most monstrous duties that could be imposed, and when the House sees it in its true light, it will get very short shrift. There is another aspect of this Tariff to be considered. We talk a lot about placing the people on the land. The Government say that we require population.  They  say that what we need is a good yeomanry. I agree with them in that. But how does this Tariff appeal to men who want to go on the land? What inducement can they see in it to help them on to the land? If a man secures a block of land, I have already indicated the increased tax he will have to pay on his fence at the outset to protect him against vermin. The price of the implements which he re-  quires to work the farm is also to be increased. The manufacturer must have his machinery from the best makers in the world. He must get the very best and most up-to-date machinery, and must have it on the free list. But the farmer must take his machinery from the local manufacturer, who has every opportunity with the high duties to charge higher prices. </para>

                            <para>- I was dealing with the case of the young farmer. If a settler desires to build a house for himself and his family, he finds himself confronted with increased duties on the whole of the material he requires. There are many places in Australia where stone or brick is not available, though, even in the case of stone and brick houses, there is an extra cost, consequent upon the Tariff, of ,£3 on the roofing, and also in regard to the wood required. . I consulted three different builders as to the present cost of erecting an ordinary four-roomed cottage at Kalgoorlie, Broken Hill, or in Queensland, where brick or stone is not available, and I was informed that the additional cost amounts to £30 or £40. </para>

                            <para>- At any rate, in South Australia, the imported timber is nearly always used for building purposes, and in this connexion the Tariff hits the settler very badly. Then the miner finds himself under similar disadvantages. At Broken Hill, for instance, the duty on timber is a very serious matter. Owing to the immense width of the lodes, in many instances hardwood timber cannot be used. </para>

                            <para>- There may be a place 400 feet wide, propped up with Oregon timber, which, by its creaking, gives sufficient warning of danger before it gives way, whereas hardwood snaps oft' at once. It will be seen that, under these circumstances, the duty on Oregon timber is very severe. Then, with low grade ores, the best machinery is necessary ; and here we have a problem which faces those interested in mining in Western Australia. This problem has to be met either by a reduction of wages, or by procuring up-to-date machinery which will do the work at less cost. I venture to say that, in order to get the necessary machinery, it is necessary to go abroad; .but, then, those who require machinery have to face a duty of 25 per cent., and pay several other charges before they can get to work. As I said earlier in my speech, the Tariff is ill-conceived, inasmuch as it does not even give the protection it pretends to give. One manufacturer in my constituency produces strippers, but the duty on his raw material takes away all the advantage which the- </para>

                            <para>- Some of it comes from America and some from England. This manufacturer was informed that the steel was turned out locally, but he found out that the local steel cost him  8d.  per lb., and, moreover, would be of nothing like the quality of the English or American product. The particular piece of steel which I have here is American; and it costs five cents, a pound in the country of origin. Here we have a case, in which, although there is a duty on the manufactured machine, the taxation through the Custom House on the raw materials removes all the supposed advantage. As a matter of fact, this manufacturer would sooner work under free-trade conditions than under the, severe handicap of a duty on his raw material. </para>

                            <para>- Stoneware and chinaware. The bulk of these goods comes from England, "but those included in the second invoice to which I refer were imported from Hamburg, and arrived at Port Adelaide on the same day as the goods imported by the <inline font-style="italic">Oswestry Grange.</inline> Under the old Tariff rate of  20  per cent, the goods included in the second invoice would have been liable to duty to the extent of  £601s. 9d.  ' The importer paid that amount' of duty on the goods without question, but he paid the additional impost due to the increased rate under the new Tariff under protest. I am quoting figures from an invoice bearing the Customs Department stamp, and it shows that the additional impost charged on this consignment as the result of the increased rates under the new Tariff amounted to£51  16s. 9d.,  or nearly  100  per cent, more than the duties chargeable under the old Tariff rate. The gentleman who imported these goods has supplied me with figures showing the actual transport cost. I take another invoice for goods arriving from Liverpool on the  24th  August by the <inline font-style="italic">Everton Grange.</inline> The total invoice value of the goods amounts to  £10 1 8s. 6d.,  and on these there were the following charges made: - Packages,  £1 14s. 6d.";  inland carriage in England,  13s. 4d.  ; ocean freight to Adelaide,  £5 1 6s. 6d.  ; bank exchange and marine insurance,  5  per cent.,  19s. 3d.  ; landing charges at Port Adelaide, wharfage, agency and cartage to Adelaide,  £1 10s.  ; or total charges amounting to  £10 13s. 7d.  on goods -valued at  £10 18s. 6d.  It should be remembered that these goods were chiefly jugs and other crockeryware in universal use, and requiring to be replenished probably more often than any other articles in the same line. The figures I have given show a total transport cost representing nearly  100  per cent, upon the actual cost of the goods. I have another invoice of similar goods to the value of£5810s. This is submitted as a sample of the charges on the consignment of goods from America, which arrived at Port Adelaide on the  26th  August from New York, by the <inline font-style="italic">Kazembe.</inline> This consignment consisted of butter dishes, sugar basins, and such ware for table use, and the charges in connexion with this shipment were-packages,  £11 7s.1d.  ; inland carriage in America,  £10 14s.1d.;  ocean freight to Port Adelaide,  £31 3s. 6d.  ; bank exchange, marine insurance,  5  per cent., £5  12s.  ; landing charges at Port Adelaide, wharfage, agency, and cartage to Adelaide,  £7 13s. 9d.,  or a total of £66  10s.5d.  These charges, without any duty payment at all, represent no less than 113 per cent, on the invoice value of the goods. Yet, notwithstanding this great natural protection and advantage, an additional impost of about  33  per cent, is added under the last Tariff to the amount of the duty chargeable on the goods under the old Tariff. I venture to say that every line of crockeryware and stoneware will be found to give similar results. There is no escaping these figures, as honorable members may, if they please, see them set forth in the original stamped invoices. </para>

                            <para>- That is so, except in one case, as I have already said, the additional amount due to the new Tariff was paid under protest, and the invoice will be found to be marked by the Customs officials, " Received under protest." When we come to consider the detailed items of the Tariff I am sure that similar results will be found to arise in connexion with other lines of goods. While I recognise that protection is the policy of Australia, I wish to draw a line between protection and prohibition. So far as I can learn from the evidence taken by the Tariff Commission, there have been no languishing industries in Australia,  and they were all going on well under the old Tariff. Notwithstanding all the criticisms of that Tariff, it was producing good results. Two or three manufacturers in Australia in a large way of business have informed me that they would prefer the old Tariff, with its extensive free list, under which they could import their raw material, and many of their tools of trade, duty free, to the Tariff now submitted. I venture to say that so far as the primary producer is concerned, this is one of the most oppressive Tariffs ever introduced in Australia. It would be bad enough if its effects were confined to Victoria, but when honorable members come to consider the great extent of Australia, and the disadvantages and difficulties attending the development of the country in many remote districts, they can realize how burdensome this Tariff must be on many of those connected with our primary industries. I take, for instance, the duty on cream separators, and I ask whether we are going to manufacture those machines here? </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps the honorable member is not aware that there are very few of these machines manufactured in Great Britain, in spite of the wonderful advance in manufactures which has taken place in the old country. I have here a statement from which it can be seen that the cream separators sold in Australia in 1906 were valued at £400,000, and yet machines to the 'value of only £15,000 or £18,000 were imported from Great Britain. I may inform the honorable member for Melbourne Ports that only the finest class of steel can be used in the 'manufacture of these machines, in consequence of the extremely high rate of speed at which they are run. Swedish steel is used- in their manufacture, and the greater number of them are imported from Sweden.. Had there been a duty on cream separators last year, not one of these machines would have been made in the Commonwealth, although the unfortunate dairymen of Australia, who often - perhaps with wife and family - have to work from daylight to dark, would have had to pay £40,000 more for them, in addition to the indirect charges which, no doubt, they would have been called upon to bear. The possibility of having these machines manufactured in Australia is not contemplated, and why, then, should the dairying industry be penalized? If protective duties are to be imposed, let them be imposed for the protection of industries which have a chance of succeeding in Australia. Do not let us unduly burden primary industries- as has been proposed in connexion with- the duty on wire netting - for the benefit of an insignificant manufacturing industry. Why should the whole Commonwealth pay 2d".  per dozen more for matches than was charged prior to the introduction of the Tariff, merely to' benefit thirty or -forty hands who are receiving a few shillings a week in a small Richmond factory ? t trust that the Committee will so modify the Tariff as to greatly reduce the burden of the producers and consumers of Australia. I am sorry that we cannot tear it to pieces at once. While we are talking generalities, the public is being overcharged. We have heard a great deal about the political grab in connexion with the increase of the parliamentary allowance, but it was nothing to the grab of the tradespeople under the Tariff. Hundreds of them have increased prices on goods upon which no extra duty was paid, and even on goods which are not dutiable under the Tariff. This robbery of the public will continue until finality is arrived at in regard to the duties. I trust that, whatever Tariff is agreed to, it will remain for a number of years. </para>

                        <para>- I recognise that it is difficult, if not impossible, for any one of us to say anything that is entirely new on any of the many subjects which are comprehended under the two very wide motions which we are discussing, but I am consoled by the reflection that no two members, and I suppose no two men, look at any large subject eye to eye. We are here, as the members of a deliberative body, to listen to the views of representatives from different States, and from different parts of the States, espousing different fiscal beliefs, and reflecting, unconsciously, if not consciously, the views of the various classes affected by the Tariff. The speeches which are made from the many stand-points and sub-stand-points from which the feelings of the people of the Commonwealth may be expressed are of the utmost advantage to us, and I acknowledge that I have derived very great benefit from hearing the views of honorable members. None of us imagines that he monopolizes all know-  ledge on subjects of this kind. We may have a very full acquaintance with the purely economic aspects of free-trade and protection, and be firmly of opinion that one or other fiscal policy is absolutely the correct policy ; but, as practical men, we must recognise that we are npt providing for the conditions of a new country ; that we are not here to determine how things can be managed, having regard to abstract principles, but must bear in mind the conditions under which the existing industries of the Stares are being conducted, and the individual and class views which are held throughout this enormous territory which we call Australia. I have derived great advantage from the speeches of the honorable members for Illawarra and Perth, which were highly valuable for the light which they threw upon the proceedings of the Tariff Commission, one of the most important bodies ever constituted in this country. It was expected that the appointment of the Commission would contribute largely to the final settlement of the seemingly interminable Tariff discussions. To paraphrase the utterances which were made at the time, it was said, " We do not want to occupy the time of the Federal Parliament for another year in discussing fiscal questions : but there are many anomalies and inconsistencies in the Tariff which ought to be rectified." It ought to be recollected that it was a free-trade Ministry which appointed the Commission, on the distinct understanding that its primary object was to remove the anomalies of the Tariff. </para>

                            <para>- No; but I state that the head of the Ministry was a freetrader, perhaps one of the greatest freetraders of Australia. At all events, even if I admit, as the honorable member reminds me, that it contained some protectionists, it was such a mixed Ministry that its only possible object could have been - presuming that it had the welfare of the country at heart - to come to some just settlement of this question. </para>

                            <para>- I admit at once, al though it does not touch my argument, that it was stated afterwards - possibly before, although it did not come to my ears - that in this State there were strangled industries, and industries which were dying; because pf the competition from the imported articles. The Tariff Commission was very cautiously appointed, and I think that the House scrutinized its constitution with very great care and interest. Everybody recollects that it was made' up of four recognised free-traders and four recognised protectionists, and it was hoped that one of the results of its appointment would be that not only would the anomalies be removed, but that many so-called injustices would be remedied. But I ask honorable members to recollect that where we appoint experts, or men who are qualified and willing to hear expert opinion, weigh the pros and the cons, and arrive at something like a judicial determination thereon, they are much more eminently fitted, than is any advocate of a particular cause, to decide what is just and reasonable with regard to any question submitted. We ought not to forget that the Commission was at work for two years and a half, and that it had advantages which no member' of the House can have; because, whatever one-sidedness there may have been in the minds of the free-traders, was counterbalanced by the equally strong views of the protectionists, and <inline font-style="italic">vice versa.</inline> We had, if it ever could be obtained in human affairs, a well-balanced body of intellect, specially appointed, with the power of extracting the truth from evidence given under oath, and arriving at balanced conclusions as to what was just and fair to all. concerned. </para>

                            <para>- The Tariff Commission, I repeat, was in the nature of a 'jury, which was itself put under oath, which put its witnesses under oath, and which was equally balanced in regard to two conflicting fiscal doctrines. Can the opinion of the honorable member for Maribyrnong, such as he has just expressed, be placed by any rational person side by side for one moment with the judicial opinion of a body of eight men who were under oath themselves, and had heard evidence under oath, with regard to the matters committed to their care? The Commission ought to have been to this Chamber a guiding star. No one can gainsay,, without uttering an untruth, that it was a balanced body of men. </para>

                            <para>- I repeat that the Commission was a balanced body of men, because it contained four free-traders and four protectionists ; and now, after knowing most of those gentlemen as legislators for nearly seven years, I should find it very difficult to say which of them has the stronger convictions. It strikes me that they are all- men with some firmness of character, and strength of views, and that they brought these qualities to bear on the work of the Commission. If honorable members seriously consider the position in which the country is to-day they must honestly say " The Commission was appointed by the Government of the day, sat for two years and a half, and brought up certain recommendations into which they threw all their knowledge and ability. We shall not and cannot enter into those details for ourselves, but will accept their conclusions as a fair solution of a very thorny and difficult question which has been submitted to Parliament." </para>

                            <para>- The very essence of the Commission was that it was a complete body, with, as I say, the balanced corporate judgment of protectionists and free-traders. But whenever the free-traders alone or the protectionists alone have come to a conclusion, I think that the Committee has a perfect right to say, "In that case you are not' the Commission ; you are only part of it, and although we W1 not reject your deductions, we think it necessary to look into the evidence to see on what grounds you acted." . </para>

                            <para>- It might be, but I do not think we need lay down a  stereotyped answer until we have made an examination. The honorable member will admit that if the four Commissioners who were opposed to his fiscal views came to different conclusions, he would be not only entitled but under an obligation to examine into them to see how far those Commissioners had gone wrong. It has been , made clear to us, I think, why in a great many cases the free-trade quartette, as I shall call them, came to a different conclusion from that arrived at by the protectionist quartette. " After the examination-in-chief of a very large number of witnesses the freetraders entered upon a very severe cross-examination of the witnesses, and founded  their conclusions on the primary evidence and the cross-examination combined, whilst, according to one .authority here, the protectionist quartette confined their consideration to the evidence in chief. Honorable members will understand that I am not going to find fault with one side or other, because I am talking now in general terms about a body which I regard as having been appointed as a sort of judicial tribunal. If after asking men of calibre to sit on a Royal Commission to inquire into difficult questions, putting them under the obligation of an oath and enabling them to take evidence on, oath, the House lightly regards the results of their hard work, which has been ill-recompensed, I believe that it will find very great difficulty in the future in getting men of calibre to sit on. Royal Commissions; because any man who regards himself as competent to do that work may well say, " I may sit for months, and hear a great quantity of evidence; I may give many evenings to the consideration of that evidence, and come to certain conclusions, but I may find that the whole -of my work and my conclusions have been ignored by the House." If an honorable member anticipated that the House was going to ignore all his careful thought and consideration, he' would say at once, ' ' I shall not sit upon this Commission." </para>

                            <para>- I do not wish the personal factor to  obtrude  in this discussion, but if I were a member of a Government which had deliberately appointed a Commission to inquire into some very grave ' problems, and had invested it with important and weighty powers, I should feel it my duty, if that Commission had spent anything like the time which the members of the Tariff Commission have devoted to their work - either to accept its findings or to take some other step that would clear the question. </para>

                            <para>- I do not understand the attitude of the Acting Prime Minister. There are occasions upon which we expect Ministers, and especially the leader of a Government, to take up some stand for principles. I am advocating a principle which I am sure every honorable member, irrespective of the party to which ;he belongs, must recognise. It is an easy matter for the Acting Prime Minister ito " pooh pooh " the idea, and to say that since the Commission has not reported in accordance with his own individual opinions its findings should be disregarded. </para>

                            <para>- I have not yet found fault with the Government as a whole. At present I am merely inculcating a general principle, but I do not think that the House has so far indicated a disposition to show to the findings of the Commission that respect which it ought to have for them. When I speak of the Commission I refer, as I have said before, not to four free-traders, or to the four protectionists, but to the eight gentlemen appointed to investigate and report upon this very  difficult question. </para>

                            <para>- That is immaterial to my present argument. The Commission was also appointed to inquire into cases in which industries were being ruinously affected by reason of the insufficiency of the Tariff. Whatever may be the view of the Committee as to. the scope of the Commission, I.  am sure that a large majority of honorable members will agree that, having regard to the fiscal bias that we naturally possess, no man in the House possesses a capacity equal to that of the composite body of free-traders and protectionists who inquired into the working of the old Tariff, took evidence, and analyzed that evidence in a variety of reports. The Acting Prime Minister, however, has plainly told the Committee - and I hope that honorable members will note this - that even where the Commission of eight has weighed the evidence relating to any question, and arrived at a unanimous conclusion upon' it, he will concur in that conclusion only in so far as he approves of it. </para>

It is very well for him to say, " I will do this or that" ; that is the attitude, not of a schoolmaster, but of a despot, who imagines that this Committee is to be whipped into certain conclusions which he holds,, and is to indorse them, simply because he holds them. I hope that there is in . the Committee enough spirit to lead to the honorable member being made to understand that it is going to use its own brain power, and its own intelligence in utilizing the findings of a body for which it has, and ought to have, great respect. </para>

                            <para>- I have, I say, derived a great deal of advantage - especially in regard to the work of the Commission - from the speeches delivered by the honorable member for Perth and the honorable member for Illawarra. . I did not have the pleasure of hearing that delivered by the honorable member for Illawarra, but I had the advantage - which I willingly admit - of reading it. Those two speeches reveal an immense amount of useful information, which honorable members should take into their consideration. There is no man in the Labour Party to whom I attribute so- much acumen and who seems to have read so widely and to think so independently as the honorable member for Perth; and that gentleman gave us a most calm and dispassionate statement of the position which he and his fellow free-traders have taken up upon the Commission. He did not say, " We free- trade members alone are right, and the House ought to accept our findings," but he said, " I will tell the Committee the circumstances under which we, as freetraders, arrived at certain opinions." They were these - that after a number of witnesses had been examined, they were cross-examined. Honorable members will recollect from their perusal of the newspaper reports" that in many cases where manufacturers went before that Commission and told a woful story of the dreadful ' condition, financial and otherwise, in which they . found' themselves, and when they were faced with their own balance-sheets in cross-examination they actually went the length of contending that such questions were not subjects of inquiry. But they were the subjects of inquiry, because one of the functions of the Commission was to find out how' far it was true that certain industries were being strangled. I shall mention in a few moments an industry which has constantly, cried out about the bad times it was undergoing, and I will show that for five years it has paid 10 per cent.- dividends, that it has put away in the last year another  5  per cent. - although it has placed that money away in funds which are to be seen on. the balance-sheet - and that its £1 shares to-day stand at  36s.  and  38s. </para>

                            <para>- It serves no purpose for the Minister to drag a red herring across when a  speaker  is on a distinct trail. Honorable members will see why I give this illustration - and it is only one. I want to show, that if you have  a  large body of manufacturers coming before  a  Commission, which is going to  have  weight with Parliament, and if you find that a number of witnesses tell that Commission a woful story of their financial state ia consequence of the Tariff, and if then, when they are examined against their will, it is shown that their businesses are producing very large fortunes, and exhibiting great success, it proves the importance of cross-examination. I take it that the primary object in appointing the Commission was to elicit the truth. We want to get at the truth. We enabled the Commission to put the witnesses on oath in order that the Commissioners might have a better chance of eliciting the truth. And if, as the honorable member for Perth states, there were many cases of the kind I have indicated, they should induce honorable members not only to accept the findings of the Commission where the eight members were unanimous, but to look with great scrutiny into those cases in which the findings of one part of the Commission have been based upon the evidence in chief of a number of witnesses who, under cross-examination, have shown that their first representations were - well, not true, to put tha mildest construction upon them. I have had put into my hand the terms of the Commission. They read - </para>

                    <para class="block">If I were asked for my opinion as to whether or not that Commission places any limitation upon the scope of the inquiry, I should say, "Absolutely none." It is an authorization to the Commission to explore the whole field of our industries. Whether it authorizes them to recommend a cure for unsatisfactory conditions in the shape of a cut and dried Tariff is another matter. But if the Commission has exceeded its functions - and I do not admit it - in not only inquiring and reporting upon the condition of industries, but in recommending a Tariff which in their opinion is best qualified to meet the case, that does not interfere with our right to look into the matter for ourselves, and it does not lessen the value of the Commission's reports. I have thus derived great assistance from the two speeches on the work of the Commission to which I have referred. They have been an invitation to me to look very closely into the reasons which led to the free-trade quartette differing from the protectionist quartette upon those subjects upon which witnesses were cross-examined. I remember - and most honorable members will recollect also - that many witnesses, after telling what I have called a woful tale to the Commission about the bad times they were having, revealed, by their own balance-sheets, that their condition was a very prosperous one. One industry to which I have referred shows a very healthy State of things. We shall, I insist, have to look very closely into the findings of the two branches of the Commission. We now know the principles which have actuated the Acting Prime Minister. We now know that the Acting Prime Minister and, possibly, the Government, too - have approached the whole question in this spirit: "It is true that you have had a Commission, but we did not appoint it." What has that to do with the matter? If we assume that the Commission was composed of eight honest men, actuated by a desire to arrive at honest conclusions with regard to this question, four of whom came from the other side of the House, and four from this side, what does it matter what Ministry appointed them? . What would be thought of a Government who said, concerning the judgment of a Court, " We did not appoint those Judges." It amounts to the same sort of thing. . . </para>

                            <para>- It would be just as relevant to my argument for the Acting Prime Minister to tell us that some of its members have fair hair and others dark. He does not seem to have grasped the principle which I am emphasizing. I do not know whether he wishes to grasp it ; but evidently he does not grasp it, otherwise he would not volunteer the statement as to the way in which he, personally, has looked at this matter. If the Committee know that the Government have paid no regard to the recommendations of the Commission- </para>

                            <para>- As long as the Committee know the attitude of the Acting Prime Minister my purpose will be served. It appears then, that the work of the Tariff Commission extending over two and a half years is to count for nothing. Of course, the Tariff is primarily the work of the Treasurer and the Comptroller-General of Customs. When honorable members know that the minds from which it emanates have been actuated by a want of principle of the sort I have mentioned, they will know how to approach its consideration. Whilst I have elicited that fact, I have endeavoured to emphasize the gravity of treating the recommendations' of the Commission as if they were a mere haphazard expression of opinion by some individual with a biased mind. </para>

I do not say that we are bound to accept the conclusions of the Commission if we should discover some irregularity in its mode of working. But the Commission has done its work thoroughly and harmoniously. There has been so little indication of any differences of opinion between its members, other than those of a fair and intellectual character, that we ought not to hesitate to accept its unanimous conclusions. </para>

Will the honorable member not consider that if we obtain a recommendation from eight members of the Commission, four of whom have a fiscal bias towards protection, and an equal number of whom have a fiscal bias towards free- trade, the proposals to which they agree will represent a fair compromise under the circumstances under which they were appointed? </para>

Is not his position similar to that of one of the parties to a law suit, who runs into the jury room, exclaiming " You must give your verdict this way ; otherwise I cannot agree with it." The whole object of appointing a Royal Commission like the Tariff Commission is that the House may be saved from undertaking unnecessary work. If we adopt the suggestion of the honorable member for Flinders that, in connexion with this Tariff, we should endeavour to arrive at some conclusion which will be regarded by protectionists and free-traders alike as a rational settlement of the question for a number of years, I think that in. future questions of this sort should be left to a Tariff Commission to investigate judicially, and to advise the House upon from time to time. </para>

                            <para>- I paid a tribute, which I think is justly due, to the honorable member for Illawarra  and the honorable member for Perth', for' their valuable contributions to the debate. From his point of view, the' honorable member for Bendigo has also said a good deal to assist the Committee in its deliberations. I wish to acknowledge, because I am perfectly sincere when I say that I feel indebted to several honorable members for their speeches, the important information and arguments put forward by the honorable' member for Flinders and the' honorable member: for Kooyong with regard to the state of our finances. I cannot pretend not to have entertained serious doubts  myself, looking over the records of past years, as to our financial position, and as to the time which we are now very closely approaching when we shall have reached the end of our Federal financial arrangements, and have to exercise a. great deal of care and caution in dealing with questions that determine the relative financial positions of the States and the Commonwealth. Those honorable members have placed the Committee under an obligation by Having gone so carefully, and I think so impartially, into the finances in order to inform honorable members of the apparent gravity of the' situation. There is at times too great a tendency in this House to attribute everything a man says to his party feeling. But however strongly one may feel upon certain issues, there are questions of a broad Federal character upon which a great many of us ought to be carefully listened <inline font-style="italic">to,</inline> inasmuch as the observations made about them are irrespective of party or fiscal  . beliefs.  The remarks made upon the financial position by the honorable member for Flinders and the honorable member for Kooyong were very valuable in that respect, for they did not seem, either by the manner or the tone of their delivery, to indicate the presence of any party bias. I wish also, in order to be fair, to acknowledge the great value of the speech of the honorable member for South Sydney. It was most notable for the honorable member's candour about what he intended to try to do in .regard to the Tariff. Those of us who read our papers, and study current events, know that the intention has been generally credited to the Labour Party for a very long time - I am not going to say that it was not their intention - to encourage a prohibitive Tariff in order to reduce the revenue and so necessitate the imposition of a land tax. There is no doubt that, if that course had been followed, it would have carried out the intention frequently expressed by the leader of the Labour Party to "burst up," or, as he. more mildly, but quite as effectively, puts it; "disrupt" big estates. The honorable member was perfectly candid in saying that, whatever his intention may have been, he is now pre- - pared to lend a hand to reduce the Tariff considerably. I have always felt that the two most important factors in arriving at a determination of the probable fate of the new Tariff were the opinions of the Labour Party and of the group of honorable members who sit in the Opposition corner, but whose leader I am not  able to name at present. When the Labour leader told us candidly that it was their intention to cut down considerably the proposed duties upon many items affecting the expenditure  of  the working classes, I began to feel that at least one factor was at work in the direction of emasculating this extravagant production of the Acting Prime Minister. It is important, however, to bear in mind that, although the expectation of the attitude of the Labour Party with a view to a land tax was almost universal, yet as soon as the Tariff 'was announced a cry went up against the high duties proposed, not only from the mercantile class but from the working classes throughout the whole Commonwealth. At -a later stage- I shall quote from 'the Queensland <inline font-style="italic">Worker,</inline> the ablest and "most  representative labour, journal in Australia, to show that in its opinion the Tariff as promulgated by the Acting Prime Minister would add from 3s. to 5s. a week to the cost to the working classes of the necessaries of life. We may depend upon it that the Queensland <inline font-style="italic">Worker</inline> is carefully read by most labour members, and 'that article would no. doubt influence their attitude towards the Tariff. It seemed to receive an echo in New South Wales; for a special meeting of the Labour League of New South Wales was called, and a resolution, which I shall read to the Committee shortly, was carried to the effect that the Tariff was calculated to add substantially to the cost, of living of the working classes. The  president  of that body, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Flowers,</inline> a member of the Upper House in New South Wales, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGowen,</inline> the leader of the Labour Party in the Parliament of that State,  were deputed as a special commission to come to Melbourne and represent to the leader of the Labour Party the serious effect of the Tariff upon the expenses of the working classes. The Parliament of Western Australia, representing a very large body of the working classes as well as other sections of the community of Western Australia, passed by an overwhelming majority a resolution - a most unheard-of proceeding, but, apart from the question of its constitutional propriety, a very valuable indication of public feeling in that State - denouncing the Tariff. All these forces have been coming from different directions towards this Parliament, and have no doubt had their effect, upon the views of the Labour Party. [ am happy to see - and I say it without any feeling - that instead of the Labour Party now supporting this prohibitive Tariff as a solid body, a number of its free-trade members have made it clear that the party is now as free as ever it was upon the fiscal question. We can, therefore, expect the honorable member for Perth and a number of others who sit in the Ministerial corner to exercise their own discretion as to the Tariff. </para>

                            <para>- I have heard constantly, and read . in the papers,  that the intention of the Labour Party was to approve of a prohibitive Tariff, in order to lower the revenue, and thus necessitate a land tax. The honorable member for Maribyrnong may not have heard of it, but, nevertheless, what I say is quite compatible with that fact. I have heard of the matter, and we may both be telling the truth; and, therefore, I stand practically uncontradicted. If one man makes a statement, and another man says that he does not know of it, there is no necessary contradiction. </para>

That honorable member, and I think also the honorable member for Kooyong - two of the most determined mien of that party - have shown a desire, not merely to cut down the Tariff, but to do what is a fair thing in regard to Tariff reform as a whole, that is, to endeavour to arrive at some settlement which will get rid of the fiscal question for some years to come. Of course, the Acting Prime Minister laughs at such an idea. </para>

                            <para>- Well, I shall say the multiplicity of parties. If it were not for the existence of three or four parties - instead of two parties, according to the principles of responsible government - neither the Acting Prime Minister nor his colleagues would be in office to-day. I say that in no ill-natured spirit; but anybody who has watched the history of this Parliament, with their eyes and their minds open, must know that the Acting Prime Minister and his colleagues are the veritable accidents of our political life. It is very cheering to find an honorable member like the honorable member for Flinders telling us that the object of himself, together with the honorable member for Kooyong and others - whether they effect that object or not is another matter - is to reduce the Tariff to such an extent as to make it acceptable to all parties - to not only cut the Tariff down, but to try to get rid of this embarrassing fiscal issue for some years to come. </para>

                            <para>- That may be. I am sure that the Postmaster-General will be as active as the Acting Prime Minister himself in keeping the question open. ThePostmasterGeneral, if he will allow me to say so, knows no political interests, from a fiscal point of view, but the interests of his own State ; he looks at everything through the knot-hole of Victorian industries, and any complaint that may be made by the consumers of the greatest State of all. New South Wales, that they are suffering from the imposition of high duties, meets with no response or sympathy in his heart. The honorable gentleman may talk about humanitarian legislation, but his humanitarianism is limited to the confines of Victoria. I have told the honorable member over and over again that such is his point of view ; and I have made a tolerably close psychological study of him ever since this </para>

                    <para class="block">Parliament met, in 1901, so that I could, I think, give him a mental chart which would be quite readily recognised by his friends. Another important and valuable admission was made by the honorable member for South Sydney as to the nature of the new protection. I am bound to say that I think we are very much indebted to that honorable member for the very candid way in which he answered the questions and interjections made during his exposition of that theory. Whether the theory be practicable or not, I shall endeavour to show at another time ; but the contribution of the honorable member under this head was most valuable, because it shows that the ultimate object of the honorable member and his party is to tack on to the duties, however low these may be, a provision which will enable part of the duties to be shared by the working classes whom he represents. I shall have some observations to make hereafter in regard" to the practical possibility of this new protection, and, therefore, I shall not go into detail now. I desire to show that I have not come here to merely advocate my own views, but to acknowledge the light thrown on the question by other honorable members. The right honorable member for Swan made an admission, from his own point of view, which is a veritable search-light on Federal history. The right honorable member has been in office five years out of nearly seven, and, although that fact has been the subject of much persiflage, he nevertheless made the admission, which is important, that during the whole life of this Federal Parliament there has. never been one Government in power with a working majority so as to be independent in its executive and legislative action. </para>

                            <para>- The admission of the right honorable member for Swan is very important ; and everybody who has watched the progress of events will recognise its truth. When the public have a clear admission from one of our most prominent members, that during the whole of the seven years of Federation there has never been a Government in power with a sufficient majority to enjoy or exercise independence, either in legislative or in executive work, it is, as I say, a searchlight on Federal history; and it leads to some rather important deductions which account for much in the past. The right honorable member also made another admission which I think ought to be emphasized for the information of honorable members. The Acting Prime Minister who, true to his diplomatic nature, always has a smile for everybody, pursues methods of his own ; and I think he ought to be reminded of the omission made by his late colleague, the right honorable member for Swan. The right honorable member told us that notwithstanding that he attended the Premiers' Conference, and endeavoured to make an arrangement as to some substituted method of dividing the Customs revenue after the Braddon section has ceased to operate, the whole of that arrangement was broken up by the Acting Prime Minister. The right honorable member further said - and this ought to give great weight to his revelation - that the scheme which he submitted to the Premiers of the different States had been submitted to the. Cabinet of. which he and the present Acting Prime Minister were members ; and that it had been indorsed by the present Prime Minister, the latter having actually written a letter approving of the arrangement, and of its being placed before the Premiers. But the moment the back of the right honorable member for Swan was turned - although it is a fundamental constitutional principle that whatever a member of a Government may say in his Ministerial capacity is the voice of the Ministry itself - the Acting Prime Minister practically repudiated the arrangement, and he has told us, in the course of the debate, that he regards is as. " impracticable." </para>

                            <para>- That does not touch the principle with which I am dealing. The Acting Prime Minister is always some yards behind the point one has reached in a discussion. What I wish to emphasize is that it is one of the most settled constitutional principles that a Government is in the position of a. firm, any one of whose partners or members can commit it to a matter of policy by an authoritative expression of opinion. The right honorable member for Swan, who at the time was Acting Prime Minister, in his desire that some arrangement of a permanent character should be made with the States to avert possible difficulty or conflict with  them as we approach the end of the term during which the Braddon section will operate, attended the Conference of Premiers at Brisbane, and made a proposal for the return of a fixed and definite sum annually "to the States by the Commonwealth. The right honorable gentleman did that with the authority of his Cabinet and with the specific authority in writing of the Acting Prime Minister as a member of 'that Cabinet. </para>

The right honorable gentleman further said that he had a letter from the Prime Minister confirming his proposal. But the moment the Prime Minister's back was turned, and the right honorable member for Swan left the Government, the Acting Prime Minister, in his confident manner, denounced the proposal as impracticable. </para>

                            <para>- The occurrence throws a very interesting light on what I may refer to as the sense of constitutional propriety of the honorable gentleman who is now acting as Prime Minister. Then the right honorable member for Swan told us something further, which throws additional light on the delicate political and constitutional sense of the honorable gentleman who occupies the position of acting leader of this House. He said that he had refused to make provision in the Estimates for certain increments to public servants until the matter had been discussed by Parliament, because, according to his opinion, the question involved was one on which this House had a right to express an opinion. </para>

                            <para>- I think that all these speeches to which I have referred have been of very great value. The speech delivered by the acting leader of the Opposition was also a very valuable speech. I hope that honorable members of the Labour Party will reflect upon that portion of it in which the honorable member dealt with the effect of the measures adopted in New Zealand for the  purpose of what is called "disrupting" the large estates. I think that by his speech the honorable member for Parramatta was successful in pricking a bubble ; because he showed that, although the policy which has been so strongly recommended is in force in New Zealand, it has not had the effect now anticipated for it. It has resulted in New Zealand only in a reduction of the size of the estates sufficient to bring them within the provisions of the law', while they have still been left too large to give effect to the desire of the men who introduced the reform referred to. I pass away from that, because I wish to say something as to my own fiscal position. We have had some expressions of opinion which I think" have led to a little confusion as to the attitude of the men who gave utterance to them. The leader of the Opposition has taken up an attitude on this fiscal question with which I am bound to say I do not sympathize. Of course, on a great question of this kind, each of us is entitled to think and to say. just what he deems proper. We have reached a stage at which it is quite impossible to hope for an absolutely free-trade Tariff in this country at present, and possibly for many years to come. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable gentleman would appear to be even more cock-sure now than he was before dinner. I am not dealing with what the honorable gentleman thinks, but with what the leader of the Opposition said. The right honorable gentleman practically admitted that the constitution of this House can be taken as a reflex of the opinion of the Australian people on the fiscal question. He has said that protection and preference have spoken during the last election, and that this Parliament has a mandate from the Australian people to give them as much protection as they think proper. I differ entirely from that view, and for this reason. The right honorable member for East Sydney has frequently said before that he would make and had made the issue of the election Socialism <inline font-style="italic">versus</inline> anti-Socialism, and certainly no one did more than the honorable gentleman in that direction. He told the people everywhere that the fiscal question had been put on one side, and that the real question before the electors was "Are you a Socialist or an anti-Socialist?" One of the consequences of making that question the issue of the election was that in New South Wales, which is the largest of the States, it was distinctly arranged that anti-Socialists should not demur to supporting protectionist candidates so long as they were anti-Socialists. Even some free-traders were opposed by the free-trade party in New South Wales, because we knew that they were Socialists. The result in the case of New South Wales at least - and I am sure that in the other States the same thing prevailed - was that many honorable members were returned quite irrespective of their fiscal beliefs. " They were returned upon the issue of Socialism and anti-Socialism. I say, therefore, that this House returned on that issue cannot be taken to represent the feelings of the people on another issue altogether. I am not so sanguine as to believe that when once a country has been committed to protection for any length of time it is easy, even if possible, to bring it back to free-trade, because the operation of a policy of protection creates protectionists. I can refer to typical instances in New South Wales. Three or four importers in that State who were strong free-traders, finding their business as importers so checked that it was impossible for them to confine it to importing, deliberately established small industries for the manufacture locally of some goods which they had previously imported. Those men are to-day, if I may say so, rabid protectionists. </para>

                            <para>- Does the Acting Prime Minister mean to approve my statement as a fact, or does he mean to express approval of what those people have done? What they have done they have done for self-interest. By conviction they are free-traders, but for political and business reasons they are now protectionists. Will honorable members contend for a moment that because their personal interests are one thing and their intellectual convictions another, those men have changed their views from those of free-traders to those of protectionists, when they know that they are advocates of protection merely because they find it best suits their pocket, which is with them a vital consideration? Protection converts importers into manufacturers, and thus makes more protectionists. Every man, woman, boy, or girl who finds that his or her living depends on the maintenance of a particular industry naturally follows that particular fiscal cult which supports the enterprise from which he or she derives subsistence. Therefore, I' do not expect that for perhaps many years to come there will be any close approach to free- trade . But that does not affect my convictions. It is one thing to say what I believe to be right under certain conditions, and another thing  to say what I believe to be practicable. An honorable member cannot say, " <inline font-style="italic">Adam Smith</inline> is my Bible, and I insist on nothing short of free-trade ' ' ; but a practical politician may say, " I regard free-trade as the ideal of commercial freedom, and part of the great body of freedom for which all Liberals fight. I cannot get all that I want, but I am willing to take the best that I can get." We began Federation with the prospect of an Australian Tariff against the world. Free-traders like myself naturally said, "Although, we  are  living in a free-trade Colony, we so value freedom of trade between the Colonies that we are willing to risk some protection against the outside world in order to abolish the miserable fiscal barriers which now interfere with the free commercial dealings of the people of Australia. _ If we do this, we shall have gone some distance towards the achievement of our ideals." No less a person than the Prime Minister, when addressing the Imperial Conference in London, said that if it would entertain the idea of Imperial free-trade, we in Australia would consider it. I do not think that it would be considered by protectionists generally. But the statement showed that, just as I and other free-traders were willing to take our chance of a Federal Tariff against the outside world in order to secure Inter-State free-trade, so there are protectionists as well as free-traders who are content to risk a Tariff against the outside world to obtain free-trade between all parts of the Empire, and thus gain the economic advantage of having every conceivable human need supplied within the King's dominions. The honorable member for Flinders, in answer to, I think, the honorable member for Kalgoorlie, told the Committee that he has changed his fiscal views. That was has way of stating the position. My idea is that the honorable gentleman, though a free-trader at heart, recognises that to Victoria, at all events, protection is, at the present time, a necessity, and he is, therefore, prepared to accept the inevitable in regard to the Tariff. So, too, am I when I have done my best t'o make the duties as low as possible. It is not that I believe in tariffs; because I regard the perfection of liberalism to be absolute freedom of commerce- </para>

                            <para>- I agree with the honorable member. To obtain' revenue, even free-traders impose duties on such goods as stimulants and silks, which cannot be made in the country, so that the duties may not act protectively, and rear up hot-house industries at the expense of the public. A great many persons suppose, because they cannot get absolute free-trade, that every free-trader in Parliament has practically foresworn his opinions. I' pin my faith as much to-day as before I entered Parliament, to the doctrines which Adam Smith pioneered. But I recognise the practical difficulties of the case, as, I take it, the honorable member for Flinders does. A quotation was made from a <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report of what he had said in the Victorian Parliament; but it must not be_ forgotten that his position as a member of that Parliament was entirely different from his position here. He was at that time a member of a Legislature controlling the affairs of one State only, in which protection had been established for over 30 years ; to-day he is a member of a Legislature in which six States are represented, the largest of which, before entering the Union, was notoriously free-trade. </para>

                            <para>- I shall not stop to argue with the honorable member on his assertion, though I have my own opinion on the subject, and believe that, apart from the conversions which have been made through people's pockets, New South Wales is to-day as great an advocate for freedom of trade as it was prior to Federation. When Federation was- mooted, the great problem was how . to find the revenue which would be needed for Federal expenditure. We all remember the difficulties over which Conferences and Conventions laboured in their endeavour to solve that problem. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. James</inline> Service, one of the ablest politicians we ever had in Australia, spoke of it as the " lion in the path." He did not see how it was going to be solved. It was solved by the very simple proposition of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Braddon. I have heard the provision which he caused to be inserted in the Constitution referred to as the Braddon "blot"; but every constitutional student knows that but for that blot the States would not have federated. None of them, especially not the smaller States, would have dreamt of giving up their Customs revenue without being guaranteed the return of a  large portion to meet ordinary Executive needs. As a compromise tending towards a settlement of the  question, the Braddon provision was limited to ten years. Therefore, when the States federated, it was upon the condition that the revenue collected from duties of Customs and Excise should be distributed by the return of three-fourths to the States, leaving one-fourth to meet the needs of the Commonwealth Administration. We knew that for some years the States would be largely dependent on their share ; and the ten years for which the Braddon section had force was regarded as a period during which each and all could look round and think out some new adjustment of " the finances. We all came into this Parliament pledged to recognise the duty of imposing such a Tariff as would produce sufficient revenue to return to the States as much as would meet their needs.  In the first instance, it was thought that a Tariff yielding £6,000,000 a year would give a sufficiently large return. But the needs of both the States and the Commonwealth have grown, and in the seventh year cf Federation we are approaching the time' when the Commonwealth will require the whole of its one-fourth of the Customs revenue, and must determine whence it  shall get more revenue if more should be needed. I am sure that no thoughtful member of the Committee can fail at times to feel anxious for the future when he hears from certain honorable members a programme which involves an expenditure of many millions sterling. Rightly or wrongly - my own opinion is that it is wrongly, as I shall . endeavour to show in a few moments - we are told by the Labour </para>

One naturally asks oneself the question, "Where is the money to come from?" That is a conundrum to which there is no solution, unless it is further taxation, reduced expenditure, or the taking over of a larger part of the Customs and Excise revenue by the Commonwealth. </para>

I am putting the position hypothetically, because I want to show, as the honorable member for Flinders did, its gravity. It simply means that if we take no more of the revenue, and continue the scheme of expenditure which the Acting Prime Minister is prepared to enter upon, with a youthful indifference to where the morley is to come from - on. the Micawber principle of " Thank God that is paid," long before it is paid ; - if we enter upon a phase of that sort, we shall land ourselves in very great difficulty. Therefore, one has been obliged to consider one's free-trade principles here, and how the revenue is to be raised. Whilst maintaining one's fiscal convictions one has to recognise in the circumstances that we are forced to impose a certain amount of taxation, which, however, free-traders hold can best be raised by low duties. After the speeches of the honorable members for South Sydney, Flinders, and Kooyong, it must be quite evident to the Committee that the Tariff will be cut down considerably. </para>

I do what I think right, and my constituents are liberal enough to allow me to do so, because they defer .to my better judgment. But the honorable member is on an entirely different footing. He goes to his constituents, finds out what they want, and promises it to them.  His  convictions are usually an algebraical x, whilst mine remain, and. my constituents pay me the compliment of considering that in most cases I have opportunities for knowing better than they. </para>

                            <para>- I want to say again  what I have said here more than once. I do not think that we ought to forget that the whole of our troubles over the Tariff have resulted from a great breach of faith at the very beginning of Federation. There are new members of the House who perhaps have not had reason to make themselves as familiar with the early stages of Federal history as have I and others who have been here since the opening, and who took an active part in bringing about its establishment. We all know that Australia looked to its first Prime Minister to solve the great fiscal problem. What was the position at that time? Here was Victoria, having enjoyed protection for thirty-five years, with a substantial Tariff in force, and there was . New South Wales with what was popularly known as a freetrade Tariff - a Tariff certainly the freest in the world, freer than that of Great Britain - and the question for any man who seriously considered the circumstances of Australia, was to ascertain h'ow the difficulty of establishing a Tariff which would do justice to both States should be solved. I pay <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton, then <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Barton</inline> - now a member of the Bench of the High Court - the compliment of saying that his conception of how it should be done was very sound, but, unfortunately, precept is one thing and practice is another. When he went to Maitland, he told the people of Australia who were listening anxiously for the solution, how he intended to solve the difficulty. He proposed to do justice to everybody, to establish a Tariff which would give " revenue without destruction." He found it necessary to tell the people that he did not propose to destroy the industries of Victoria, but he implied in that remark that he intended to give some consideration to the greatest State of all, so far as population was concerned - New South Wales, from which he came. In the Town Hall of Melbourne, he said, " Victoria cannot have her Tariff, and New South Wales cannot have her Tariff " ; he made it clear that there must be a compromise between the two.  His  intentions were good, but he got into bad political company. He had taken, into his Government the honorable gentleman who is now Acting Prime Minister. Can honorable members imagine that honorable gentleman trying to do a fair thing between two States on the fiscal question? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Barton</inline> took into his Government also <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Alfred</inline> Deakin, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston.</inline></para>

                            <para>- The honorable gentleman must not be taxed too closely with what he said sui years ago, because the principle on which he represents Hume involves many and frequent changes. Six years is too long a time to be forced to hold the same opinion when a man represents a constituency on the principle he adopts'. Whilst <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Barton,</inline> both in New South Wales and in Melbourne, was advocating a fair compromise between the Tariffs of New South Wales and Victoria, and whilst <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O'Connor,</inline> who was afterwards a member of the Government, was deprecating the raising of the fiscal issue at all in New South Wales, the three gentlemen I have named were telling the people of Victoria and South Australia that a Tariff as high as that of Victoria was necessary, or - and here we have the old story again - the industries of this country would be ruined. We free-traders, who were actually supporting the candidature of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O'Connor,</inline> together with that of five out-and-out free-traders for the Senate, began to see which way the land lay ; we began to see that, although <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Barton</inline> might be disposed to do what was spoken of as " the fair thing " between New South Wales and Victoria, his colleagues were determined to drag him into extreme protection. We recognised immediately that we should have to sit in opposition, but not necessarily to oppose the Government, provided it carried out the policy and observed the statements and undertakings of its chief. We soon discovered that the Government had no such intention; for whereas <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Barton</inline> started with fine precepts, he ended with the most melancholy practice. He gave himself up entirely to these gentlemen as well as to the honorable member for Hume, now Acting Prime Minister, who told the people of New' South Wales that a  10  to  15  per cent. Tariff would be a fair one. </para>

                            <para>- It is said that we undergo intellectual changes, and that if one tells an untruth often enough, one comes to believe it. And so, when a man tells the truth about a certain matter, but changes 'his views in regard to it after a lapse of many years, it is perfectly natural that he should forget that he had told the truth. I can afford to put aside the honorable member, and not allow him to disturb the course of my argument. We came down here, and what did we find? There was submitted to the House a Tariff which, instead of being a compromise between the people of New South Wales and those of Victoria, averaged, according- to my own showing, 6 per cent, above the old Victorian Tariff. We, as a party, had to fight for twelve months to reduce that Tariff. In that work we were assisted, among others of the Labour Party, by the honorable member for Grey. We fought for twelve months to bring down the Tariff to the level at which the leader of the Government had undertaken that it should be launched. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Barton</inline> was then in the hands of these honorable members to such an extent that he had not a will of his own, and could not do all that he wished. Then, again, he was beguiled by the three gentlemen I have named, and influenced slightly by the present Acting Prime Minister. I wish the Committee to remember that this has left a dangerously, sore place in the feelings of the people of New South Wales. It is not a matter for merriment, that more than  1,250,000  of the people of Australia should yet harbor a feeling of resentment in regard to that deliberate breaking ' of a promise as to the nature of the Tariff which should be imposed upon them. Honorable members will recollect that the people of New South Wales already had to bear a land tax and an income tax, and' that,  in order to justify those imposts,, duties' had been removed. I have just had put into my hands - and it is very- useful - an extract from a report of a speech made by the Acting Prime Minister, and published in the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Morning Herald</inline> of 22nd January, 1901. The honorable member for Hume then said - </para>

                            <para>- This is history - and it touches all of us - which has a very important bearing upon the harmonious working of the States. I am sure" that no one can view the present attitude of the States towards the Commonwealth without feeling some concern. There is, of course, the happy-go-lucky attitude, which, I hope, few honorable members take up,  of snapping one's fingers metaphorically speaking, at the States, and saying " We do not care." But every observant person will agree with me that there are to-day many indications of growing discontent and a dangerous attitude on the part of the States towards the Commonwealth. It behoves every one of us to look very closely into the position in order to see what we should do or not do further, because, as long as we have this condition of unrest touching the conditions of the "people we certainly shall not, as a body politic, progress as we might otherwise do. The secret of commercial success lies in the - certainty of what is ahead. If we are to have Tariff changes every five, six, or seven years, it follows that every, business man - I care not whether he be a merchant prince or a  coffeestall-keeper - must be left in uncertainty. If .we are going to have the- Tariff .changed in this way from time to 'time without, in some cases, rhyme or reason- and I snail show in a moment that there is no reason for the present change - then the progress of this country will be very seriously retarded. But quite apart from our commercial progress there are indications that we are approaching a very dangerous time. There is more than we see in the action of the Premier of New South Wales in seizing upon a few beggarly rolls of wire. There is nothing in the wire itself, but it is an indication of the spirit which exists in that State; and, although I seriously deprecate a person in the high position of the' Premier of the largest State of Australia resorting to physical - I might even call them primeval - methods of seizing property from other people, instead of appealing to the tribunals which exist for the purpose of settling disputes, there is very little doubt in my mind, from what I can see in the New South Wales newspapers, that hundreds of thousands of people thoroughly indorse the extravagant action of the Premier, because of the trend of public feeling in that State towards the Commonwealth. It is a very serious thing. </para>

                            <para>- It is truly deplorable. It is an example to other people of less importance. When the highest political personage in a great country like  that takes steps of this sort to obtain possession of certain property, instead of resorting to the Courts of law it is reprehensible and an example of the worst kind to other classes, who may be much less ready to observe the. law than he is. We are very apt to lose sight of the fact, because we are a different legislative body, that we represent the same  people as do the Premiers of the States. Those very people in whom this feeling of antagonism is being created are all of  them our own constituents. Twenty-seven members of this House represent the very  people in New South Wales who have these  feelings of antagonism against the Commonwealth. The similar feelings existing in Western Australia and Tasmania are the  feelings of the very people who are represented in this House. They are not merely  the feelings of. the people of the States, because the people of the States and our constituents are identical in sympathy and in interest. </para>

                            <para>- That is another question. In political matters it is not always whether a feeling is justified that we have to consider, but whether it exists. The honorable member knows that some of the biggest struggles that have taken place in the world have arisen over very small things. They have begun in a very small way. Reprisals have been taken,, and very soon conflicts have ensued, having  social and political consequences over which it was impossible to exercise any control. It is very much like a devastating bush fire that may result from a discarded match. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member may say so if he likes, but if people are sometimes ridiculous - even if, as Carlyle said, they are " mostly fools" - you have, nevertheless, to reckon with them. It is of no use to say that this affair is of no importance. It is a very remarkable thing that a very large portion of the population of New South Wales actually indorsed so reprehensible an act because of their indignation with the Commonwealth'  on account of other things. </para>

                            <para>- I have already said that I am expressing my own opinion. I am not laying down a law of the Medes and Persians. The honorable member for Hindmarsh is no doubt going to make a speech on his own account. We shall then be able to have his opinion about it. I am. expressing mine.  From reading the newspapers of New South Wales, I have come to the conclusion that a large number of the people of that State indorse the action of the Premier. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Hindmarsh asks what sort of people they are. That is riot the point. If it is essential that a body of people should work together in harmony, and if, instead of that, you see that there is antagonism amongst them it does not matter whether the feeling is wise or not. If there are such feelings of antagonism, it is the duty of everybody who has at heart the welfare of the community to try to stop those angry feelings, to do something to prevent them. It is our duty to find out how they have arisen ; 'and when we find that they have arisen in consequence of injustices alleged or real, we should endeavour to get rid of the imagination in the one case, and of the injustice in the other. I would ask the honorable member to listen to what seems to me to be the causes of these feelings, not on the part of the New South Wales people only, but on the part of those of the other States also, towards the Commonwealth. The fencing wire is a very small matter, but it shows at all events that the highest political officer in the State can afford to do what could ordinarily be done only in a primitive community. .  His  action has not been generally condemned. It has not been generally condemned in the New South Wales newspapers. </para>

                            <para>- It is a great mistake to suppose that one has any personal feeling in this affair. I am not speaking of the Minister of Trade and Customs. There seems to be a sort of electricity in the air which induces some honorable members almost to impute to me party motives in making this statement. I am deprecating the position, because, as one of the politicians who took an active part in bringing about Federation, I am grieved .to think that what we expected would result in a veritable political partnership, looks as if it were in danger of ending in disruption. We hear secession talked of on every hand. It has been advocated in New South Wales, Queensland, and Western Australia. As the honorable member for Hindmarsh suggests, this may be the result of action on the part of very foolish people, but at least it indicates a desire at the present time- </para>

But when we recollect that all the Premiers of the States deliberately met the Treasurer of the Commonwealth in Conference, and arrived at an arrangement with him in substitution of the Braddon section of the Constitution, and when we remember that that arrangement has been thrown on one side by the Acting Prime Minister, who has declared it to be ridiculous and impracticable, I ask whether his action is not offensive to the States? </para>

After asking the Premiers of the various States to meet the Treasurer of the Commonwealth in solemn conclave, and after making an arrangement which provided for the return of a fixed sum to the States in substitution of the Braddon section, is there no offence in the Acting Prime Minister snapping his fingers at the whole agreement in the very teeth of the Prime Minister ? </para>

                        <para>- Order. I have repeatedly called honorable members to order for interjecting, and I am afraid that members upon the Ministerial bench are the greatest offenders in this respect. In any case these conversations across the Chamber must have the effect of preventing any honorable member from making his speech in an intelligible way, and therefore I must ask honorable members to cease their interruptions. </para>

That arrangement was to come into operation after the Braddon section had expired. The proposal of the ex-Treasurer  was to return to the States a fixed sum in order to compensate them upon a definite basis for the loss of revenue they will sustain consequent upon the expiration of the Braddon section. </para>

                            <para>- We all have our ideas as to the qualities which should be possessed by an Acting Prime Minister, and I will make no comment in that connexion. But I repeat that the right honorable member for Swan told the Committee that he himself had made an arrangement with the Premiers of the States, under which the latter were to be guaranteed the return of a fixed sum annually after .the expiration of the Braddon section of the Constitution. </para>

                            <para>- He told us that that arrangement had been thoroughly indorsed by the present Prime Minister. Very naturally, therefore, the States thought that it would be likely to receive the sanction of this Parliament. Whether that be so or not, the fact remains that it was put before a Conference of Premiers assembled for the purpose of discussing it. But the moment the right honorable member for Swan vacated the office of Treasurer the arrangement was repudiated by the Acting Prime Minister. The latter has declared in this House that he would do the same tiling again, because the agreement arrived at is an " impracticable " one. That is the data upon which I am about to found an observation. Is it unlikely or unnatural that the leading politicians of the States should come to the conclusion that they are being played with ? The honorable member for Swan, as Acting Prime Minister, called the Premiers of the States together, to a Conference, and made an arrangement with them, subject, of course, to the approval of Parliament. But then the States found that, although the Prime Minister himself approved of the arrangement in writing, somebody who stepped into his place for a little term of power turned round, and on his own responsibility said, " I ignore that act of the Acting Prime Minister, although it is confirmed by the Prime Minister." That in itself is not calculated to soothe the feelings of the States. It is treating them as children, and they naturally ask, " Who does represent the Common wealth? We have a Prime Minister who is ill. We had one Acting- Prime Minister while he was away in England, and now we have another. Whilst the actual Prime Minister approves of what the first Acting Prime Minister did, the second Acting Prime Minister steps in and says that it is impracticable." That is a pretty state of things for the States to have to deal with. They are very likely to say, " God only knows who is governing this country, and managing its Executive affairs." Yet we are told that the States' must not be angry, but must take that sort of treatment from the Commonwealth coolly. </para>

Any man who understands his position as a Federal politician will regard it as one of the obligations of every thoughtful mm in - both State, and - Federal Parliaments to try to make things work smoothly between the States and the Commonwealth. The. greatest war that ever took place in the United States of America was the consequence of  a  long-gathering quarrel, and we do not want even  a  suggestion of anything of that sort to arise here even on a small scale. We have to remember that the people of the States are the people of the Commonwealth, and, therefore, we are dealing with identical interests. Seeing that we in this -Parliament represent the whole of Australia, we ought to' do. our best to smooth away these difficulties and prevent their recurrence, even if they are individually only pin-pricks. </para>

                            <para>- They are trying to smite it now, but we shall be showing a little magnanimity if we try to soothe them without any reprisals. Another matter that has displeased New South Wales, apart from any other State, is the treatment of the Capital Site question, with which I do not think we have dealt fairly. </para>

                            <para>- I am not blaming anybody ; I am not even blaming this Parliament. But it is perfectly natural that a great State like New South Wales, having the largest population, should feel a little hurt that, although this Parliament has been in existence for seven years, no step has been taken towards establishing the Federal Capital. </para>

If the Federal Parliament has really taken legal possession of the land, as asserted by the honorable member, who is not a legal member, and speaks much more confidently than legal members will on legal questions, how is it that the Commonwealth Executive has never touched the ground? It cannot do so. It can physically, but the moment it does so it becomes a trespasser, and then the whole question is raised for the High Court to settle. If the honorable member asks the Prime Minister, or any other member of the Cabinet, why they do not put the pegs in the so-called chosen site, they will tell him confidentially why they do not do it. If the site was chosen three years  ago, why are not some steps taken to give authority to the choice? </para>

                            <para>- I shall not stop to deal with the explanation which the honorable member so readily offers. Either no Capital Site has been chosen at al' or the one which was chosen is not touched by the Government, although the choice was made three years ago. The people of New South Wales' feel that they are being fooled over the matter. Rightly or wrongly, it is a grievance, because every one will admit that New South Wales is entitled to have the Capital within her boundaries. If the site has been chosen, let the Government do something- to test their right, and then let us see what the High Court says about it. Perhaps then the honorable member for Grey will come to the conclusion that he does not know as much law as he thinks he does. Why has Melbourne been retained as the Seat of Government ? Why is the site not chosen, or the one which has been chosen not taken? We know very well the attitude of the press of this State on the subject. The Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> said that it was quite true the Constitution provided for the selection of a Capital Site, but that the Constitution did not say " when ' ' the site had to be selected. The newspaper went on to say, " We, of Victoria, ought to adopt the attitude of Shylock, and say,  You can have your pound of flesh, but no blood.' " That is the miserable, paltry, contemptible attitude assumed by the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age.</inline></para>

                            <para>- I really do not know what the names of the candidates were, not even the nature of their politics - neither fact touches the question. New South Wales is alive to what is going on ; and it is very natural that the people of that State should feel aggrieved. The Western Australian Parliament has taken a step which points to the widespread dissatisfaction there is in regard to the Tariff. Did any one ever hear before of a .Parliament passing, by an overwhelming majority, a condemnation of a Tariff which the Commonwealth Parliament had the power to pass? Whichever State we go to we find evidence of dissatisfaction. Whether the people be right or wrong, foolish or wise, they are our constituents, and we ought to try to prevent them entering into conflicts, whether of mere words or suggestive of a more substantial and serious character. It is part of our duty to remove causes of dispute and grievances. We ought to remember that originally we were promised a Tariff in the nature of a compromise between the fiscal arrangements of the greatest State and the next greatest State of the Commonwealth. From  1902  until the other day, we had a Tariff which was only reduced to its working proportions after a year's fighting, and that Tariff was, as introduced, 6 per cent, above the previous Tariff of Victoria. Whether we are freetraders or protectionists, we ought not to allow our fiscal bias to prevent us doing justice. There are  1,250,000  people in New South Wales, the bulk of whom we must remember have strong free-trade proclivities, and when the first Federal Tariff was passed they were enjoying greater fiscal freedom than any other country in the world. That is a fact which ought to be taken into consideration. I should like to say another word, in more detail, about the Tariff Commission. When that Commission was appointed by the then Prime Minister, who was the .right honorable member for East Sydney, he was asked whether the consumer would be considered, and he replied, "Yes, certainly." Thus it was part of the duty of the Commission to consider the consumer ; but I submit that there is a tendency on the part of Parliament, especially on the protectionist side, to forget the consumer. I do not say this with any party feeling, because freetraders, I admit, regard the fiscal question largely from the consumer's point of view. It is the consumer whom we have first to consider, and next there is the manufacturer. It is unfortunate that, although many manufacturers and producers gave evidence in support of their claim for more protection, the consumer was not at all represented, except in the minds of the Commissioners. No representative men who might . be said to reflect the feelings of the general public, came forward to lay their views before the Commission. We free-traders, of course, look on protection as a form of subsidy which is given by the general public in order to start an industry, and, naturally, we feel that the man who has to pay the subsidy ought to be considered in regard to the amount to be paid. The consumer has not been sufficiently considered; and, therefore, I say to the protectionists in the House - if there is any use in saying it - that when we are considering the propriety of particular duties, we should take into serious consideration the effect of the duties on the ordinary householder. Let us, by way of illustration, take the very homely domestic article of condensed milk. This milk, I suppose, enters into the economy of almost every working man's home, and, indeed, every other home, as child's food, or as a substitute for ordinary milk. We find that there are eight manufacturers of condensed milk within the Commonwealth. The duty under the last Tariff was1d.per lb., and it is a fact that the whole of the present manufacturers have declared that they require no higher duty. Letters to that effect have been sent by the manufacturers broadcast, and have reached the Government ; and yet it is proposed that there shall be a further extra duty of1½d. per lb. </para>

                            <para>- I hope the honorable member will -not make those economic reflections. Condensed milk is a very good illustration of the absurd way in which the Tariff has been framed. The consumer has been forgotten ; it is the man in constant touch with the Minister or his officers who can get what he asks, while the consumer may figuratively speaking "go hang." The consumer is everybody, and, therefore, it is nobody's particular business to represent him; and this is a matter which ought to be taken into serious consideration by honorable members. We were told that there were many ruined industries in Victoria; and we all remember the story told to the Tariff Commission by the representatives of the Denton Hat Mills. </para>

                            <para>- It is not enough, though there is a good deal to condemn. I should like to let honorable members know what this " miserable, declining" industry is doing. They should find the information somewhat interesting. I have here a copy of the company's report, which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Investors' Review</inline> of Victoria, which shows that whilst the face value of the company's shares is £1, their present market price is 38s. I find also that this Company, which we have been invited to believe has been suffering so seriously, paid a dividend of 10 per cent, in 1904, in 1905, in 1906, and again in 1907. This year, in addition to the 10 per cent, dividend, the Company put away £500 towards an insurance reserve, and still had a balance of , £1,013ofun- divided profits. Honorable members will see that this declining industry really made enough profit to pay a 15 per cent, dividend, and yet, naturally, it wants more, and it will go on wanting more till further orders. </para>

                            <para>- No, the Company paid a 10 per cent, dividend for each year mentioned, but put away enough this year to represent another 5 per cent. Last year the Company put away £829 in the shape of undivided profits, in addition to £3,000 paid in dividends. They put no money to an insurance fund that year, but they did set aside £100 for another purpose. I should be justified in saying that last year the Company might have paid a dividend of 13 per cent, or 14 per cent., and this year they made enough to pay a dividend of 15 per cent. If the interests of those engaged in manufacturing industries are to be kept in view in accordance with the principles adopted by the Commonwealth, it may be that some protective duty is  necessary, but should we make our protective wall so high as to enable this Company - because the duty is a factor in enabling them to make their profits - to make the public pay so much for their head-gear that by manufacturing the article locally they can pay a dividend of 10 per cent., and put away additional profit equal to another 5 per cent., and nearly double the value of their shares? </para>

                            <para>- Possibly Mie honorable member, for Wide Bay has been in some little mining investments. At all events the man who gives 38s. for a <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> share thinks that there is some substantial reason for the rise. The hat-making industry does not exhibit sudden rises and falls, and no parallel can be drawn between that industry and the gold-mining industry. I give this as another illustration to show that the public are being made to pay this larger sum because it is supposed that this particular industry is suffering a very great decline in its prospects. I wish to say that I think we are making a very great error in Australia in connexion with our industries. If we are to consider the welfare of the race, the conditions under which our people labour, and the advantage of humanitarian legislation, we should try to induce our people to follow those occupations which are most healthful. That will be admitted as a general proposition. It will also be admitted that there is no comparison between the health-giving character of rural life, and that of life in a great manufacturing city. The people of Great Britain followed pastoral and agricultural pursuits as long as they could. It is only in the later history of that country, when pastoral and agricultural pursuits failed to maintain' the great population that had arisen, that they resorted to manufacturing pursuits. </para>

                            <para>- I wish to say that the development of manufactures is a part of the later history of Great Britain, and was resorted to by the English people as a matter of necessity. If one visits such towns as Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, or Nottingham, he will notice that the people are anaemic and unhealthy as compared with, those who are to be seen in the rural districts. No one doubts for a moment that this is due to the life which people have to lead in the great manufacturing cities. No matter how carefully they -may be provided for by regulations insisting upon smoke consumption and proper ventilation, they cannot expect anything like the health-giving conditions of the rural districts. Yet in a young country like this, where we have millions of acres which can be cultivated, we are doing our best to offer inducements to people to come into the towns, instead of trying to see what we might do to induce them to lead the more healthful country life. </para>

                            <para>- I am not at present saying whether they are or not. We are doing all we can artificially to aid manufacturers .to offer employment to people which will draw them from the country into the city. The higher the wages offered to people to engage in city industries, the greater will be the temptation held out to them to leave the land. </para>

                            <para>- I am merely laying down a general proposition/  The Labour Party devote their attention to the conditions" of the working people, and they profess to regard the health, careful living, and prosperity of the working classes as an element in their policy. i am in entire sympathy with them in that. If even as ah individualist I am shown something which is inimical to the interests of the people" and infringes their right to healthy occupation, I shall be one of the first to lend a hand to prevent such a thing. A broad -consideration attaching to our protectionist policy is that to-day, instead of lending ourselves to schemes for putting people  on  the land - and I am not now saying how that can best be done - we are offering artificial inducements to manufacturers in order that, in their' turn, they may offer monetary inducements to people to come into the cities instead of remaining' in country' districts. The policy is one which we ought to carefully watch. We ought to do all that we can, and should leave nothing undone to enable our people to lead the healthiest possible 'life. 1 have heard explanations of what is going on. When I made an observation to this effect the other night I heard some one say that the large estates should be burst up to enable the people to go upon the land. I join issue on this point. I do not believe that the land is as fully utilized as it might be, but when we hear it said, as we often do, that there have been 800 or 900 applicants for one piece of land, no one who knows anything of .land ballots will take such a statement as an index of the number of people honestly wanting land. It has been the practice in some cases, and certainly in New South Wales, at certain times, to put up land at upset prices very much less than the land is worth in the market. As a consequence, hundreds of people living in the towns send their money to an agent at the place where the land ballot is to be held, and he makes a regular business of putting in applications on their ' behalf , and if any of them are successful at the ballot, he sells the land for them. </para>

The honorable member has peI haps a little more experience of the land than other people, but he ought to remember that we are all trying to learn something of what he knows. I say that the fact of 800 or 900 people having balloted for a piece of land in this way is not an indication that they all desire to settle on that land. </para>

                            <para>- I am not now arguing as to what ought to be done, but 1 am referring to one of the causes of misunderstanding on the part of certain people who imagine that these rushes of applicants for a particular piece of land afford an indication that they all desire to settle on the land. A large part of them have no intention to take up land, merely wishing to get it at upset prices in order to resell at a profit. I admit, of course, that there are hundreds of others who are desirous of settling in the country.  But it is one of our misfortunes in Australia that our people have been taught to look upon land as worth only <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> an acre, and, when they want land, they expect to get it at that price. There are many land-holders possessed of large estates who would be willing to cut up and sell their properties at their actual market value. I know  of many cases in which land-holders would sell their estates for the actual earnings over a number of years capitalized, but as* that would make the cost £2, £3, or <inline font-style="italic">£4</inline> an acre, there are no buyers. Prospective settlers expect to get at least 640 acres, and cannot afford to buy so large an area at such prices. But land-holders cannot be expected to give away their land, nor should Parliament take it from them except at its market value. </para>

                            <para>- The land is to be " disrupted ' ' irrespective of the volition of the person who holds it. _ A tax equivalent to 5 per cent, on the capital value of land would destroy its profit-earning capacity, and if a tax were imposed with that object, so that the owner might be forced to part with his property to other persons, a gross breach of contract would be committed by the State. The State, in selling land and taking money for it, enters into a bargain guaranteeing peaceable possession and quiet enjoyment to the purchasers. If afterwards they are forced to sell for less than the market value of the land, the forced sale amounts to confiscation. </para>

                            <para>- When a tax is so heavy that it makes land valueless to its holder, its imposition amounts to confiscation. If our people, instead of wanting land at <inline font-style="italic">j£i</inline> an acre, or at less than its market value, and in large holdings, were prepared to buy small holdings at market values, thousands of settlers could be scattered over Australia. In the United States men will be found making a living near big cities like Philadelphia on, perhaps, an acre of land, growing strawberries, or asparagus, or' similar crops for the local market; while thousands do well on holdings of ten acres. In this country it is thought that no settler should have less than 640 acres, of which often only twenty or thirty acres are cleared, the rest remaining a wilderness for years, while the holder struggles on with a great debt round his neck. If persons were content with smaller areas, and thoroughly worked their land, we could settle a very large number in the country, and thus find openings for many who are now seeking work in protected industries. Our people must be satisfied with smaller areas, and must cultivate their land more completely than they do at present, before we can satisfactorily settle our territory. If the public could be induced to pay market values for land, and to take up areas within the limits of ' their capital, instead of clamouring for large holdings at small prices, the land question would be largely solved without the need for legislation. Three days ago Professor Macmillan Brown gave a lecture in Sydney touching this subject of town and country. He is ' a very thoughtful man, and his remarks ought to be of- great interest.

                        <para>Labor, if wise, when it holds the reins of power, will not forget this natural truth, that it is out of, the rural districts a nation must reinvigorate itself, and that the zone of cultivable, land is  comparatively  narrow in Australia. True statesmen should do everything in their power to extend this zone and 'to push small settlement and intensive culture as far as irrigation, afforestation, and other means will carry them ; and, in order to check the hugeness and wastage of cities, should encourage the spread of cottage industries and the transference of even the larger industries to the country. The concentrated industries and factory life of our age are surely not the goal of human development, else that goal is Hades. For out of it comes an irresponsible plutocracy that dies of luxury at one end, as it breeds at the other an enfeebled, impoverished people, that gradually dwindles. True statesmen will see that the rewards of settlement in the country, and of intelligence, wisdom, and invention in the ranks of urban labour are not lessened, but increased. </para>

                            <para>- I am very glad that I have taken what the honorable member approves. I propose to say a few words about the Tariff proposals. There are a number of general considerations which I think ought to operate. I believe we shall find that a great many of the duties have been imposed without much thought. Take an instance which came under my notice a few days ago. An importer of coachbuilding material told me - and I think that his statement is correct - that prior- to the new Tariff there was a duty of 60 per cent, on the material required for coachbuilding, especially wheels. He said that under the new Tariff there is a specific duty which is equivalent to 180 per cent, in addition to the old duty of 60 per cent., but that since the duty has been imposed a fresh rule has been issued to the effect that in future a set of wheels shall be two instead of four. That increased the new duty to 360 per cent, on top of the old duty of 60 per cent., making a total duty, of 420 per cent. </para>

                            <para>- I want to show what the honorable member and his party think. I do not propose to discuss the question of the conversion of the States debts at great length, but I remind the Committee that about four years ago I characterized the movement as being entirely inopportune. I take it that the object is to avail ourselves of a lower rate of interest under the Commonwealth. After reading <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coghlan's</inline> despatch to the Federal Government, in which he deals with the question of the conversion, and speaks of it as being entirely ill-timed just now, one must realize certain facts. When we federated, in 1900, under the Constitution, and the Parliament met in 1 90 1, a New South Wales debenture for £100 bearing interest at 3 per cent, was worth £99, and Canadian 3 per cent, stock was worth £99 too. From 1901 the New South Wales 3 per cent, stock, which I believe is the best priced stock of that kind in Australia, has gradually gone down pound by pound until at the present time it is worth only £86, sometimes realizing £87. Meanwhile the value of Canadian 3 per cent, stock has remained <inline font-style="italic">at £99-</inline> In the course of his paper, which the honorable member for Kalgoorlie read, and evidently attached some importance to, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coghlan</inline> says that, whether we like it or not, we, as national borrowers, are dependent upon the London money market. He does not suggest that we ought to borrow. He says that there have been exaggerated statements made, and that it is unfair that our stock should have been so affected; but certain it ' is, he adds, that our stock is affected, not by the want of prospects in ' the country, but by our legislation. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member may laugh after I have completed my speech. I am quoting <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coghlan,</inline> who says that whilst New South Wales stock, which, in 1900 was at ,£99, has fallen to <inline font-style="italic">£86,</inline> Canadian stock remains at <inline font-style="italic">£99-</inline> If what he says be true - and I put this case hypothetically, because honorable members seem to think that when T put a principle I am advocating it - if it be true that New South Wales stock in the London money market has been prejudicially affected by our legislation, we must pause for a moment to consider what that means to us. In the next ten years, we shall have to redeem loans &lt; amounting to ^80,000,006! and if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coghlan's</inline> statement be correct, we shall ha.ve to float ^80,000,000 at <inline font-style="italic">£86</inline> in order to pay off ^80,000,000 at par. In other words, we shall have to make good the difference between ' ^80,000,000 at <inline font-style="italic">£86</inline> and ^80,000,000 at £100 </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member will recognise that if, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coghlan</inline> states, Commonwealth legislation has led to a reduction in the price of New South Wales stock from £99 to  £86,  we should not do much good by attempting to convert States stock. The opportunity has gone. When, by floating a loan for some purpose or other, we have shown that a Commonwealth debenture will command a better price than will a State stock, it may be advantageous for the States to hand over their stocks to us in order that we may borrow to pay them off. We might have taken this step at the outset, and we may have a suitable opportunity on some future occasion. I think, however, that the present is an inopportune time for advocating such a proposal. </para>

                            <para>- No. If New South Wales stock had remained at £99, we should have been able to borrow at £99 in order to pay it off in full. Let me take as an illustration the position in regard to one debenture of £100, which, in 1900, was worth £99. If that price remained unchanged, when we had to pay off that debenture, we should be able to borrow another £100 at £99 to pay it off, and we should thus lose £1 on the transaction. If, on the other hand, we could only obtain  £86  for our new bond of £100, we should lose £14. </para>

                    <para>Coghlan be right in saying that Commonwealth legislation has caused New South Wales stock to fall from £99 to  £86,  we could not borrow more advantageously than could the States. We know very well that people at Home do not take into consideration the divisions between one State and another. They have regard to Australia as a whole, and do not take the trouble to distinguish between the States. "Australia" is the word they use. The question that we have to consider is, how can we borrow more money to pay off these debentures at par? </para>

                            <para>- He might distinguish to a slight extent between the stocks of the different States, and, as a matter of fact, there is a difference of 10s. or £1 between the prices of some of the Australian stocks-. I have taken that which was at the top of the list when Federation was established. Had I taken the. stocks of other States, I should have shown that they had fallen from a lower rate to a still lower rate. My only object is to show the difficulty we should have in endeavouring to raise money to pay off our debentures at par. </para>

                        <para>- The State has something else to do with its money, I suppose. Now, I have a word or two to say about the transferred properties. I do not approve of the way in which they have been treated. Five years ago I advocated that the money paid over by the Commonwealth to the States above the three-fourths of Customs and Excise revenue that was due to them should not be paid unconditionally, but that it should be arranged with the States that those payments should be on account of the transferred properties. We were under no obligation to pay this money to the States if we had a means of spending it, and we might well have said that as one of our obligations was to purchase from the States properties for carrying on our postal and defence functions we would do so by means of the surplus which was paid over to them. </para>

                            <para>- -Those properties are the assets upon which part of the national debt of the States was incurred, and unless we were prepared to take over the portion of their national debt which was raised upon the security of their assets, we had no right to take the assets from them.  It has been the practice in New South Wales, and in the other States also, I think, that all works of permanent value which were in the nature of lasting assets, which could, if necessary, be sold in the market as properties, should be paid for out of loan money. As they were paid for out of loan money and we took over ^£9, 000,000 or ,£10,000,000 worth of them, it was an obligation on us to take over debt to the amount of ^9,000,000 or £10,000,000. It was not fair to creditors of the States to relieve them of their properties without relieving them of the debt. By adopting the course which I have suggested, we should have paid over about £8,000,000 out of the £9 000,000 or £10,000,000 borrowed by the States on account of the properties we have taken over. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, because they accepted the protection which I enunciated as a candidate of the Labour Party. The honorable member for South Sydney has formulated what is termed the " new protection." I did not subscribe to the old protection; because I considered that simply to build a high Tariff wall, and by doing so to license the power of money to exploit the poor of the country, is a mischievous proceeding. I do not want to see any industries built up in Australia at the expense of the bone and sinew of our race, undermining its stamina in the process. I quite agree with the honorable member for Parkes in his denunciation of that aspect of industrialism. But are we to forego the right to develop this country and its natural resources, and to produce for ourselves whatever may be useful and necessary in times of peace, or for purposes of </para>

Are we to be bound by the policies of older nations, or are we to carve out for ourselves a new course, and to develop the industrial possibilities of our country on right lines? We can hedge about this- " new protection " in an effective way so as not only to protect the industries concerned, but also the consumers and the wage-earners. Surely we can devise some plan which will secure the end which we have in view. As I understand that Ministers are willing to adjourn, I ask leave to continue my speech to-morrow. </para>

                            <para>- I must point out that the course we have always followed has been for an honorable member to suggest that the debate be adjourned. A private member has no power to move that I report progress. That motion is usually submitted by the Minister who is in charge of the Bill immediately under consideration. But the honorable member who suggests the adjournment of the debate is naturally called upon to resume it on the following day. There is no rule which provides that he should be so called upon, but as a matter of courtesy that practice is adopted. </para>

                            <para>- That has nothing whatever to do with the question. The right honorable member for. Swan said that, Tn his negotiations with the States Premiers, he proposed that" the Commonwealth should return to the States a fixed sum annually, in lieu of the three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue. When he made that statement, the Acting Prime Minister interjected that the scheme was impracticable. I merely drew the attention of the Committee to that fact.
