                        <para>- In accordance with my promise to the honorable member, I consulted with the law officers of the Crown to-day on the subject, and was advised that there is little doubt but that we have the power to do by regulation - I think under section 16 of the Commerce Act - what the honorable member desires; but such a regulation could not come into force within less than three months after it war proclaimed. If that is so, it will be unnecessary to introduce amending legislation. I gave a similar answer on a previous occasion, although I was afterwards told that we have not the necessary power. </para>

It will be time enough to consider the introduction of an amending Bill when I find that what is desired cannot be done under the present law. If I find that we have not now the necessary power, I shall make a statement to the House on the subject, and be prepared to answer any question put to me as regards the probability of the Government introducing an amending Bill. I can hardly be expected to answer such a question as the honorable member has just put, until the case to which he refers has arisen. </para>

                        <para>Dear <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyle.</inline> - We are putting boxes on the <inline font-style="italic">Himalaya</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Medic,</inline> both leaving to-day. Can you do the same, or get your Government to do so? This is a splendid work, which  requires  to be organized. All these hundreds of passengers are potential immigration agents. Don't mix up immigration and land settlement in your pamphlet. In fact, rather issue two. In the immigration book everything must be <inline font-style="italic">couleur</inline><inline font-style="italic">de rose.</inline> No hint of difficulty about getting land. You need not be afraid you will be rushed. Even when Queensland offered cheap farms in London, there was only one applicant. As regards land settlement for home (Victorian) consumption, you can he as pessimistic and as indignant as you please. The blacker the better, though don't get too much on the line, " What is the use of having the immigrants here, when we have nothing to offer them." That would choke off subscriptions. Anyhow, don't do anything to. frighten off immigrants, because competition for them is so keen in Europe, and even if conditions change for the better in Victoria you might find that it was of no avail, as you had given the place a bad reputation. </para>

We cannot continue to have a penny inland rate in one State and a twopenny inland rate in the others without serious injustice being done to those who pay the heaviest postage. </para>

                            <para>- As the honorable member is aware, the present rate of postage in Victoria is one penny, whereas the rate in South Australia - even if a letter has only to be carried from one side of the street to the other - is twopence. It seems to me that we must make the rate of postage throughout Australia uniform. </para>

                            <para>- Immediately the Minister of Trade and Customs had concluded his remarks, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McColl,</inline> who at that time represented Echuca, moved the adjournment of the debate. The House, however, with the exception of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McColl,</inline> unanimously objected to its adjournment. Honorable members were clearly of opinion that the motion then under consideration was of more importance than was the business which was to follow. The debate was carried on for a considerable time, and in the end the motion was unanimously agreed to. Notwithstanding that fact, however, and despite the Minister's statement in the concluding portion of his remarks that I had acted in the public interest in directing attention to the matter, and that the passing of the motion would strengthen his hands in giving effect to the wishes of Parliament, nothing has been done in the matter so far as I can ascertain. On the  25th  of September last I again asked what steps had been taken by the Department <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> give effect to the resolution of the House. From <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> I learn that a long reply was given to my question. A large number of Latin names were hurled at my inoffensive head - names that I am prepared to admit I can neither spell nor pronounce. But the_ latter portion of the answer stated that as regards infantile and artificial foods the Commerce regulations required a trade description to be applied stating the true description of the goods and their country or place of origin. It added that these regulations would come into operation on the  1st  of January,  1907.  When the Estimates were under consideration I again brought this question under the notice of the Minister, who, in the course of a somewhat vague and indefinite reply, said : - </para>

                    <para>Nothing short of the actual carrying out of the terms of the resolution passed by this House will be satisfactory to me. We were told that regulations relating to the introduction of patent and proprietary medicines would come into force on  1st  January last, but although practically seven months have elapsed since that date nothing has been done. The resolution was adopted nearly twelve months ago, and the only assurance that we have from the Government is that something may be done, within the next three months, to give effect to it. The Minister, however, is not quite sure on the point. In view of the opinion expressed by honorable members during the debate on the motion which I submitted last year, and the statement then made by the Minister, I consider that we have been most unfairly treated. The question affecting, as it does, the lives and well-being of hundreds of people, is of much importance. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so. The Government have invited the House to vote a bounty on the production of peanuts, and although that may be a matter of some importance, the safeguarding of the health of the people is of infinitely greater concern. If the Minister as the result of inquiry has ascertained that neither the Commerce Act nor the Customs Act enables him to take the action promised by him, he should make a plain statement of the facts to the House, and seek the power that he lacks. If he took that course, I am sure the Parliament would agree without any waste of time to vest him with the power to enable him to take decisive action. It is unnecessary for me this afternoon to dwell upon the necessity for giving effect to the resolution. I have no desire to take up a hostile attitude towards the Ministry, and, as I am sure honorable members are agreed as to the ill effect which many proprietary medicines have upon those who use them, I shall not attempt at this .stage to go into details. The suggested' regulations would not prevent the local manufacture of patent medicines, and infantile foods, that being beyond the scope of the powers of the Federal Parliament, but the least we can do is to prevent the importation of such preparations unless their component parts are clearly shown on the labels which they bear. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. I am not asking for the prohibition of these preparations. I simply say that the people who use them should be able to ascertain for themselves what they are actually buying. Knowing of what these preparations consisted, they might safely be left to take whatever action they thought fit. Some time ago, a resolution bearing on this subject was passed by the Legislature of New Zealand, and although the Government of that colony took action, they ultimately backed down. It would be interesting to learn the reason for this. I remember reading some time ago in one of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stead's</inline> annuals, an article dealing with the action of a mythical Empress in Central Africa, who sent an ambassador to London, with a direction that he should write by every mail giving her his impressions of England. Among other statements made to her by the ambassador, was one to the effect that public opinion in England was formed not by Members of Parliament or Governments, but by the press, and that the opinions of the press were manufactured to suit the advertisers of quack medicines, so that the vendors of nostrums really formed English public opinion. Some time after the passing of the resolution which I submitted to the House, I saw in the daily newspapers a cablegram, in this connexion which is worth reading. It was as follows :  - </para>

It was decided to recommend members of the Chamber to cease advertising in colonial newspapers where the Bill is in force requiring a declaration of the formula; of preparations. </para>
            <para class="block">Having regard to the publication of such a statement, together with the fact that the Minister promised twelve months ago that he would do something in the direction sought by me, and that he was glad that his hands had been strengthened by the action of the House, it would be interesting to know why nothing has yet been done. Are those who advertise quack medicines in our newspapers more powerful than the Government? Are they the power behind the throne? It is about time that we had an authoritative statement on the point. I hope that the Government, if they find that they have not the power necessary to enable them to require the formulae of these preparations to appear on the labels, will lose no time in asking Parliament to confer it upon them. If, on the other hand, they have the power, they should at once take action. The delay which has occurred is certainly a justification for my action in moving the adjournment of the House to allow this subject to be discussed. I shall not attempt to outline the 'ill effects which many patent medicines have on those who use them, for I know that other honorable members, belonging to the medical profession, are far more competent than I am to deal with that phase of the question. I have repeatedly asked the Minister of Trade and Customs whether any action was being taken, and it is because of my failure to obtain anything like a satisfactory statement on the point that I was driven to submit this motion. </para>

                    <para>.- There can be no doubt that the Minister of Trade and Customs is sympathetic, but the public would like to have from him a definite statement as to the position which the Government intend to take up. If the law as it stands does not permit him to insist upon the formulae being placed on these preparations, he should ask the Parliament to pass a Bill to remedy this defect. I am sure that the motion has not been submitted because of any desire on the part of the honorable member for Barrier to delay the consideration of Government business, and if the Minister . needs stimulus to action on his part, he can quickly obtain it from any one knowing anything of these preparations. No medical man in this Chamber would object to the course proposed by the honorable member for Barrier, and I doubt if there is one in Australia who would not welcome the adoption of the suggestion that all patent and proprietary medicines and foods should be so labelled as to enable the purchaser to ascertain their formulae. <inline font-style="italic">Truth</inline> quite recently gave, as nearly as possible, the formula of a patent medicine, known as " Peruna," which is largely advertised in the Australian press. </para>

Many teetotallers in Australia have taken that preparation, knowing nothing of its component parts. Had they known that it consisted largely of alcohol, they would not have touched it. As a matter of fact, glycerine, and other substances, can be used as substitutes for spirits in tinctures. Opium, and the derivatives of opium, are often used in patent medicines. </para>

                        <para>- A gentleman well known to honorable members takes large quantities of patent medicines, and his advice is that those who use them should take only half the prescribed dose. I hope that the Minister will give a definite answer to the question raised by the honorable member for Barrier. If he takes up a firm stand, the House will support him. We are not going to back down. If the Minister cannot induce the heads of his Department to deal speedily with this matter, he should give them a holiday, and invite the next in command to take action. If this course were adopted, we should not have to wait long for a decisive step to be taken. If there is a scintilla of doubt on the part of the Minister, let him introduce a small measure, and judge by the vote of honorable members, who, I am sure, would cause no delay with long speeches. As to the urgency of the matter, honorable members may not know that Queen Victoria would never have come to the throne if it had not been, shall I say, the malign influences by which Princess Charlotte was treated? In those days the highest medical authorities made their mistakes; and it is not to be wondered that medicine in the past has killed more than it has saved. But in these days of science, we, who make laws for the community, are entitled to say that the formulae of all patent medicines shall be made known, so that the public may be protected. If medicines are found to be deleterious to the health of the community, the Public Health Officers of the various States could, on that ground, recommend Parliament to prohibit their importation or sale. </para>

                <para class="block">Minister of Trade and Customs, a deputation, representing the Chambers of Commerce, told him that there were being imported into the Commonwealth patent medicines that were responsible for the wholesale and continuous destruction of human life. That was a very strong statement made on behalf of a powerful and representative body; and it ought to have received greater attention than it did. This House has already declared that the time has arrived when patent medicines should be dealt with in a way different from that adopted in the past; and when the House passes such a resolution unanimously, there ought to be some reason more substantial than that given by the Minister for its not being carried into effect. We desire to encourage immigration, and yet we find' that, not only infant life, but apparently adult life, is being destroyed wholesale. I know, from my own knowledge, that infants have been killed in hundreds with deleterious patent medicines; and it might be a good thing to absolutely prohibit their importation. Only the other day, I noticed that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Treves, whom honorable members will recognise as a great medical authority, said he could not understand why people take medicines when they are sick. Apparently <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Treves is under the impression .that there is another and a better way of treating most complaints than by swallowing enormous doses of medicine. </para>

I disagree with the honorable member for Barrier in his opinion that if we compel the formulae to be placed on the jars or bottles which contain patent medicines, the public, if they wish to buy them, may do so. What I say is that, if patent medicines are proved to be injurious, the Minister ought to use the power which he undoubtedly possesses, and prohibit their importation ;. and in such a step he would always have the support of Parliament. I shall not be satisfied unless the Minister informs us that he is prepared to carry out the decision of the House arrived at some twelve months ago. </para>

                    <para>. - I cannot see the difficulty which Ministers have to overcome before framing and putting in force regulations dealing with this matter. Section 7 of the Commerce Act provides that the Governor in Council may prescribe by regulation a trade description for import's of a certain class, which, according to section 15, includes medicines or medicinal preparations for internal or external use. Then, according, to section 16, the regulations are not to prescribe a trade description which discloses the trade secrets of the manufacture or preparation unless in the opinion of the Governor-General the disclosure is necessary for the protection of the health or welfare of the public. What is there to prevent such regulations being drawn up? It astounds me to think that that step has not been taken already. Why were regulations not proclaimed immediately the Act came into force ? It would have been competent for the Minister to prepare a proclamation for the Governor-General, commencing, " That, whereas, in my opinion, it is necessary for the protection of the health and welfare of the public that trade secrets relating to the composition of patent medicines should be disclosed, &amp;c." Had such a proclamation been issued, it would have been perfectly valid, and the stopping of the importation, after a lapse of three months from the proclamation, could not possibly have been challenged. If the Ministry desired to double-bank their security - though I do not think it is necessary - they could have issued a proclamation, not only under the Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Act of 1905, but also under the general provisions of the Customs Act relating to prohibited imports. There are several prohibited imports, which according to section 52 of that Act include all goods the importation of which may be prohibited by proclamation. There are subsidiary provisions to the same effect. A section of the Commerce Act declares that the proclamation prohibiting importation shall authorize the prohibition subject to any specified condition or restriction ; so that even in the general proclamation under the Customs Act there could be provision, similar to that contained in section 7 of the Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Act of 1905, to the effect that if the goods are being imported without knowledge of the regulation, or not wilfully in violation of the principle of the proclamation, the imports may be detained until the necessary trade description is attached, instead of being forfeited as under the Customs Act. </para>

                        <para>- But that Act could be put in force in the way I have suggested. My point is that a vigilant Minister, who did not fall asleep, but properly administered his Department, could have had regulations drawn up eight or ten months ago; and that if he had any doubt as to their validity - which, I say, I cannot understand - -he could by issuing a proclamation under the general provisions of the Customs Act, have placed them beyond all challenge. In my opinion, the matter has not been dealt with because some question was raised at Home as to the expediency and policy of making manufacturers disclose the constituents of the medicines. Some dissent by commercial bodies to that effect at Home was telegraphed to Australia some ten. or twelve months ago, and, possibly, the Minister, modifying the view which led him to introduce the Bill, left the matter over with a view to seeing what could be done. That may be the true explanation or not;  do  doubt the Minister will . acquaint us with, the facts when he replies. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Barrier is justified in his motion, in view of the replies given by the Minister, who, twelve months ago, was at one with the House on this matter. It seems that no very special reason has been given by the Government for not carrying out the unanimous wish of the House and the Government. It is rather an uncommon experience when the Government themselves are in agreement with the House, that twelve months should elapse without anything being done. The Minister and the Cabinet have, I think, failed to grasp the seriousness of what had been going on for some years prior to Federation, and is going on to-day. I am satisfied that if investigations were made, a number of preparations, which are now sold, could be classed under either the head of poison or of absolute frauds. While there may be some patent medicines which can be regarded as fairly good compounds, it is well known to those who have had analyses made, that poison is commonly in most of them, and that those which do not contain poison are based on spirits. In the United States, the lady  President  of the! Women's Christian Temperance Union - a very fine lady, who, so far as she knew, had never tasted any form of alcohol in her life - was taken seriously ill. and when the medical men were called  in, they discovered that she had contracted the drug habit, and was suffering from alcoholism.  Honorable  members further will remember that not very long ago a saleswoman in a shop was summoned for selling liquor without a licence, she having sold Ayer's sarsaparilla, which is said to be half the strength of ordinary whisky. </para>

                        <para>- And it is" worse than whisky, because it is based on bad spirit. We are able to safeguard the public interests in regard to imports ; and there should not have been a moment's hesitation not only in stopping the importation, but in having an exposure made. There is a phase of the question I should like the Minister to bear in mind when he is replying : A gentleman of standing, who was paying a visit to Europe, was, I understand, commissioned by the Government to obtain information regarding the laws and regulations relating to medicine and drugs in other countries. That gentleman is an enthusiast in the work, and is possessed of a vast amount of information, and I should like to know whether or not his report has been presented. Australia, the United Kingdom, and America, are the only countries where these patent medicines are permitted free sale ; and these countries are the world's market for the drug packer - the man who packs stuff which does not cost a farthing, and charges half-a-crown a bottle for it. Great influence has been brought to bear in other places against the exposure of what these packers call their trade secrets ; and we had a little example of the activity of a vast ring when the Commerce Bill was before this House. Interested parties were then moving heaven and earth to prevent the law being applied in the way we deemed advisable, because if the trade secrets are disclosed the business is done. A gentleman I know had analyzed some stuff which is used for the beautifying of ladies' hair, and which costs 3s. 6d. a small bottle ; and the analysis disclosed that it consists of 99 per cent, of water and 1 per cent, of perfume. We can realize the tremendous profit on selling water at 3s. 6d. a small bottle, and what a*  large  margin there is for advertising. This particular commodity is the most advertised in Australia; it is advertised in every magazine and newspaper, and particularly the periodicals devoted to the interests of the ladies. In fact, in one publication, which is read by women principally, there are thirty advertisements of patent preparations, and all but two or three may be classed as either poisons or frauds. This information was given to me by a gentleman who has had the preparations analyzed. I cannot understand how it is that the Government have been so slow to deal with a matter of such serious importance. No wonder we are told that one gentleman in America has cleared £8,000,000 by drug packing, and, as I have said, his market is largely found in Great Britain, Australia, and the United States. It is time we set an example that the States can follow, as they did in regard to the Commerce Act. We ought to see that we do our share in regard to importations, while the States keep their eyes on the local productions. If the trade secret were exposed, I ' fancy that people would go to the tap for hair wash; and this is a fact the proprietors of these preparations well know. At a great meeting of those interested in this class of trade, it was urged that it was wrong to force them to disclose their trade secrets ; and doubtless it is regarded as a wrong, just as the promoters of a wild cat mine do not approve of it being known that it has been salted. It is our duty to protect those whose knowledge does not enable them to protect themselves. The ordinary buyers! of patent medicines cannot be expected to go to the expense of having them analyzed, so that they may know what their ingredients are, and when medical men attempt to expose the frauds which are practised upon the public by the vendors of many such medicines they are apt to be suspected of self-interest. Years of experience on hospital committees and general observation convince me that our communities are too much addicted to the drug habit, which is as bad as the drink habit, and I am sorry that the Government has made no attempt to deal with this evil. I am sorry, too, that we have not yet had the report to which I have referred, because it would be very interesting and of great assistance to us in dealing with subjects of this kind. </para>

                <para class="block">It will therefore be seen that the Minister has full power to do what the honorable member for Barrier desires to have done, and what the honorable gentleman has expressed his intention of doing. I vividly recollect that when, twelve months ago, a motion was moved dealing with this subject, the Minister said that the carrying of it would strengthen his hands, and I am surprised that the unanimous resolution of the House has not been followed by action on his part. The honorable member for Darling has deplored the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale's</inline> report is not yet in the hands of members. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> was commissioned by the Government to make certain inquiries, and has furnished a sort of progress report ; but it would be well if we could obtain, as early as possible, a full account of his investigations and recommendations. When the subject was last under discussion, I read reports from various sources regarding the constituents of some of the best-known patent medicines then being sold within the Commonwealth, and have since been told that I made a serious mistake about one of them. I am not yet convinced that I did make a mistake ; but if a proper trade description had been applied to that medicine, every one would have known what it contains, and I could not therefore have made an error, and, of course, would not have made a misstatement about it. The honorable member for Barrier desires that a proper trade description shall be affixed to imported infants' foods as well as to patent medicines. </para>

                        <para>- We hear a great deal about the need for population in Australia, but nothing tends more to reduce our natural increase than does the use of artificial infants' foods. Unfortunately, the natural method of rearing children has largely fallen into disuse ; but if a baby must be fed on artificial food, only the best should be given to it. Many of the preparations imported into the Commonwealth are of no more use for the feeding of babies than so much saw-dust would be. They contain none of the elements necessary to secure the proper development and growth of children, and many contain deleterious compounds which tend to increase infant mortality. I do not mean that they contain poisons; but the preparations are so indigestible that they cause irritation, and thus we often read of children being found by the coroner to have died from gastro-enteritis, an affection caused entirely by improper feeding. </para>

Australia is a happy hunting ground for the quack patent medicine proprietor, and it is well known that most of the remedies which are extensively advertised have nothing to recommend them but their price and the mystery which surrounds their preparation. </para>

                        <para>- Many of these preparations are sold at prices which, while returning the manufacturer handsome profits, put them within the reach of the poorer classes, who think that by buying them they are able to doctor themselves. Those who have made inquiries on the subject will agree with me that the effects of many patent medicines have only to be known, when the preparations will be at once denounced. A large number of them contain alcohol, frequently in greater proportions than undiluted whisky, and the alcohol thus imbibed is of the vilest quality, being produced by the common commercial still from ingredients treated in the first place with sulphuric acid. Such alcohol is, in the opinion of experts, unfit for human consumption. As to the way in which these so-called patent medicines are foisted on the community, I know a case in which a lady who had bought a bottle of a certain preparation was asked by a canvasser of winning personality to subscribe to a testimonial to its value. She explained that she had not taken enough of it to be sure of its effects, and was told that a£5 note would be forthcoming if she would only put her name to a form which would be handed to her. I believe that many persons have publicly protested against the advertisement of their names as testifying to the merits of these preparations, and I think there has been a law case on the subject. Many of the published testimonials are pure fabrications. I do not wish to handicap those who have honest preparations to put before the public ; but any one who wishes to retain his rights in a genuine proprietary medicine can protect himself by legal process. All we ask should be done, and all the Government has been instructed to do is to insure that the component parts of these hitherto mysterious preparations which are described as medicines shall be made known, and I hope that the expression of members' opinions will force Ministers to take action at an early date. </para>

                        <para>- That is the sort of jeer to which medical men are constantly being subjected. It is one of those cheap and nasty jeers to which they are accustomed. I have no longer any interest in the sale of drugs, and I think that of all men, I am in a position to champion the rights of the medical profession. It is a sad thing to. realize that the need for legislation of the character that we are now discussing is apparently recognised only by the few men in this Parliament, who belong to the. medical profession. Our chief consideration, I maintain, should be the interests of the people of the: Commonwealth. Mention has already been made of the deleterious effects resulting from the sale of patent medicines throughout the country. I may perhaps be permitted to explain that there are two different kinds of patent medicines. What is commonly known as a patent medicine is that which is advertised and sold to the public without any formula, accompanying it, so that the purchaser is in absolute ignorance of what ingredients form its component parts. </para>

There are also what are known as proprietary medicines. These medicines are put upon the market by proprietary  companies. Their constituent parts are advertised broadcast, so that everybody is in a position to 'know exactly what they contain. Their excellence is chiefly due to the process adopted in their manufacture. They are superior to other medicines 'because they are produced in very large quantities, with the aid of high-class machinery, and as a result are better mixed than they would be if they were produced by hand labour. </para>

To such preparations medical men entertain no objection whatever, and we constantly recommend them to our patients, because we know that they are good. But when we turn to such advertisements as frequently appear in the daily press, we find that they relate to a very different class of article. Take, for instance, somebody's " 41b pills."

                <para class="block">The last statement evidences that the manufacturer appreciates the value of allowing persons to know that these pills are free from mercury because it is generally recognised that mercury, when taken as a medicine, is  likely  to cause the teeth to become loose, and that its use in other respects is attended with some danger. I now wish to call attention to the advertising of a certain book which has recently been placed upon the Australian market. The following is the notice by a weekly newspaper of the -publication in question - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>The publication is of special interest to the medical profession in that it aims at the exposure of quackery in all : forms, and absolutely debars from its pages medical and patent or proprietary medicine advertisements. In this respect it sets an example worthy to be followed by the press generally. The present number is full of interesting material, all essentially Australian. It contains a report and clinical analyses of various "headache powders" which were purchased at different retail chemists' establishments in Sydney. These analyses confirm the statement so often made that the general public are largely addicted to self drugging with powerful drugs, especially the coal-tar derivatives. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">That is an example of what the public and the medical profession think of these medicines. As regards the question of headache powders, I may point out that there are numbers of drugs upon the market the use of which is decidedly injurious to health. We know that people at the extremes .of life are very susceptible to trouble arising from the use of opium. That drug exercises a greater effect upon them than it does upon other persons. Yet we constantly see advertisements of soothing powders containing this drug - powders whose use by children of tender years is recommended. In the great majority of instances, mothers have no desire to injure their progeny, but I will undertake to say that the lives of many infants have been sacrificed by reason of the mistaken kindness of mothers in using these drugs, which are so extensively advertised. Still another drug which is freely advertised is known as "syrup of figs." As a matter of fact, it is not made up in any way of figs, and under the impression that they are imbibing nothing but the purest fruit essences, people are taking a drug of which they know nothing whatever. </para>

                        <para>- Then why does it bear a lie upon its face? I come now to the question of hair dyes. These are frequently composed of injurious ingredients such as lead, and as a result of their use, it is quite possible for people to contract lead poisoning, or to become paralyzed for life. It is, therefore, extremely necessary that these patent medicines which are sold broadcast should bear upon their cover a proper description of their component parts. Many persons imagine that simply because these medicines bear the Customs stamp upon the bottle, the Government are actually recommending their use. This is a point to which I. would draw the special attention of the Minister. I' ,am very sorry that this .question has been brought forward rather hurriedly, and that consequently I had not an opportunity to prepare myself to discuss it at length. I regret exceedingly that under the law as it exists such plenary powers should be vested in the hands of one Minister. Happily, the present Minister is above reproach, but the time may arrive when a Minister who is possessed of no scruples may abuse these powers. That is a contingency we ought to guard against. </para>

                        <para>- If he becomes as reasonable as is the.  deputy  leader of the Opposition, I shall be quite satisfied. Upon the 2nd August last, I made a statement corresponding with the statement that I had previously made. The Commerce Act did not come into force until 1st January last, but in November, 1906, I gave instructions for the amendment of a regulation which it had been found went beyond our powers. The regulation was different from that which I had instructed should be prepared, and on 26th November last I minuted it, " Amend as required." I was certainly under the impression that the amendment had been made : but on making inquiries I found that during my absence in London my honorable colleague the Postmaster-General, who was acting Minister of Trade and Customs, had presented to him a report from" which it appeared that some objection was raised to the regulation. That report was minuted by my honorable colleague " Seen." </para>

                        <para>- Quite so, and the Minister was supported by all parties in the House in his effort to so frame the Bill as to enable effect to be given to that desire. One of the highest functions that can be exercised by us as legislators is that of taking steps to preserve the health of the people generally, and particularly of the poorer classes of the community. The rich in many cases are able to look after their own well-being, but the poor from time to time are gulled by vendors of quack medicines. There can be no doubt that Australia, as the honorable member for Perth has pointed out, has been made  from time to time the happy hunting ground of such men, and of. all who seek to live on the poorest classes of the community by gulling them to purchase medicines which, if they have any effect at all, operate deleteriously on those who use them. Many of these nostrums have led people into habits which otherwise they would not have contracted. It seems to me that our control of these matters is confined to oversea products. We cannot exercise any control over preparations made within our own borders, but it should be the desire of every State Parliament to protect the people in this direction, and particularly in relation to the use of patent and proprietary medicines. In the motion as originally submitted by the honorable member for Barrier it was provided that all medical and surgical appliances which purport to cure or alleviate disease should likewise be critically examined on entering the Commonwealth. That was a sound proposition, because some of the greatest swindles that are perpetrated relate to worthless surgical appliances that are foisted on the people. Such instruments in many cases cost a mere fraction to manufacture, and are absolutely valueless ; but the vendors succeed in making enormous profits by their distribution. When the resolution was under consideration last year, the honorable member for Laanecoorie described it as another socialistic proposal on the part of the honorable member for Barrier. To control the sale of these goods and preparations is one of the highest duties of the State, and is not Socialism. No honorable member could do better than support legislation with this object in view. I sincerely hope that the Minister will not relax his efforts to secure the protection of the people - that, in season and out of season, he will take steps to enable the public to secure full information as to the component parts of all these oversea productions. The honorable gentleman has disclosed the fact that, whilst the negotiations with regard to the framing of the regulations were in progress, letters and telegrams dealing with this very question passed between London and Australia. Those who had the control of the question during his absence have actually allowed the vendors of proprietary medicines to dictate to the Department what the regulations should provide. That discloses a very serious position. The vendors of these nostrums are naturally interested in the non-disclosure of the ingredients. </para>

The honest manufacturer takes no objection to the regulations proposed by us, because he has nothing to fear. It is only the. dishonest manufacturer who fears the passing of such regulations, and he is the man that we wish to get at. Our desire is to save the people from such individuals. In order to refresh the minds of honorable members as to the terms of the resolution submitted last year by the honorable member for Barrier, I intend to read it. I have been in sympathy from the first with the honorable member, so far as this question is concerned, and I feel that the resolution is one of which we ought not to lose sight.

                <para class="block">The proposal is a very comprehensive one, and it remains only for the Government to do its duty. As an illustration of the way in which people are often gulled by vendors of various nostrums, I propose to tell the House of a little scene which I witnessed at Bird Fair, London. When visiting that locality on one occasion, I saw a man vending what he described as a sarsaparilla.  guaranteed to effect wonderful cures. He had at his side two glasses, which apparently contained only clear water. Turning to a boy who was standing close at hand, he inquired if he felt quite well. The lad replied that he had a pain in his back. "Ah," said the man, "that is just the very ailment that my sarsaparilla will cure. " Taking up one of the glasses, he handed it to the boy, saying, " Before you swallow my medicine, blow into this glass of water." The boy did so, and the fluid immediately assumed a cloudy white colour. " There," he said, " look at the nature of his breath. It is terrible ! See how he has clouded the glass." Then he turned to the boy and said, " Now take the sarsaparilla." When the boy had taken it the vendor asked him how he liked it, and the boy answered that it was very nice. Then the vendor said, " Now blow into this other glass," which, apparently, like the other, contained only pure water. The boy blew, but the water remained perfectly clear ; and the man could not sell his sarsaparilla quickly enough at 2s. 6d. a bottle; I watched him going as hard as he could until he had cleared out all his stock. The fact is that his audience were not aware of a chemical fact. The first glass contained lime water, and when the boy blew into it the carbonic acid of his breath created carbonate of lime, which caused the water to turn cloudy. Needless to say, the second glass was filled with pure water - the man was juggling. On another occasion a vendor who was selling a worthless preparation warranted to cure corns, warts, bunions, and all the ills of life, at1s. a bottle, was interrupted by a drunken man, who asked, " Will it cure me?" The vendor replied, " No ; look here, my friend, let me inform you that my name is not Balaam, and I do not want an ass to talk to me." The man thereupon went away discomfited, and the vendor turned round to his audience, and said, " See the wonderful effect of a text of Scripture ! I quoted only one, and the man was converted at once ! Who will buy any more of my medicine for corns, warts, bunions, and all the ills of life?" That is the way these men ply their trade; they are thus able to juggle, and to gull the people, who are carried away by a little bit of wit and, sometimes, by a smattering of science. The intention of the House - and we could not do anything better - is to preserve the health of the people, and I hope, therefore, that effect will immediately be given to its resolution. </para>

                    <para>.- It is quite evident that if the honorable member for Corangamite ever loses his professional position, there is another avocation to which he can turn. I regard this debate as a triumph for the honorable member for Barrier. It shows the necessity of a person, who takes up a subject, being persistent in its advocacy . I suppose it was owing to the absence of the Minister from the Commonwealth that this matter has been allowed to remain in abeyance. However, the honorable member for Barrier has stirred up the Minister, who, apparently, has not had time to look into the papers on the subject until to-day, when it became absolutely necessary. I am sure we are all pleased that the Minister has been compelled to turn his attention to the question, and that it is his intention to see the desire of Parliament carried into effect. It is a compliment to the House, and to the representatives of the medical profession amongst us, that we were unanimously in favour of the resolution at which we arrived on a former occasion. There is a strong and frequently expressed feeling amongst the public generally that members of the medical profession do not desire that the people should remain in health. That, however, I regard as a superstition, though it is a superstition which has caught hold of very many people. </para>

I believe in professional politicians and professional medical men - men who understand their business. At the same time, can we wonder at poor people, who are in bad health, and who respond to the advertisements which are published in the most respectable journals, and in the most prominent places in those journals, being led away sometimes by announcements and by little paragraphs at the end of which there is a star denoting an advertisement. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad to hear that, though I did not suppose my remarks applied to all religious newspapers. The honorable member for Corangamite laid his finger on the weak spot when he pointed out that the Federal Parliament has power to deal only with importations. ' The honorable member was quite right, however, in urging that unless we, as a Federal Parliament, exercise the full powers we possess in this connexion we could not claim to be the leaders of the people of the Commonwealth. If we do exercise our powers we may be sure that the States will follow our example. Personally, if ever I need medical assistance, I put my whole trust in a mar who has been trained in the best schools available. But at the same time, people who are not too well off often find it a difficult problem in a case of illness to determine whether they should or should not call in a medical man. I take this opportunity to respectfully suggest to the medical members of this House, and the medical profession outside, that there ought to be adopted some reasonable method to enable the poorer class of people to obtain medical attendance at a more reasonable cost than at present with consequent financial embarrassment. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Hunter does not quite understand the purport of what I have been saying. These poor people fly to quacks and patent medicines because of their inability to pay the fees of a properly qualified medical man. And when I speak' of poor people, I mean people who are relatively poor - people who are as independent in their feelings as are the members of the medical profession, and who would not ask a favour, preferring to pay their last sixpence for what they require in the way of medical advice than to place themselves under an obligation. I am not impugning the goodness of heart of the medical profession. I shall not labour the point ; but again express my gratitude to the honorable member for the Barrier for his persistence on this question. We all agree that the Minister of Trade and Customs does not lack goodness of heart, and that it is only through pressure of business that action In regard to the importation of patent medicines has not been taken before now. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member's own experience has no doubt taught him that. In my opinion, the persons who supply the fraudulent testimonials ought also to be punished ; and I think the Government have power to take action in this direction under the laws relating' to Inter-State commerce. I agree with the honorable, member for Wide Bay that there are thousands of honest and sincere people who require medical attendance and medicine, but who are not in a financial position to pay the fees. Under these circumstances, this great and powerful Commonwealth ought to set apart a certain amount annually in order to pay medical men for looking after the poor of the country. I go further, and would have the State pay all doctors ; and I would have them put on the same plane as doctors are in China - they should cure the patient, or have their heads cut off. Under the present  systern,  if a doctor acts on the broad lines of commerce, like a sensible business man, it is his duty to keep a rich man sick as long as possible ; because, as soon as his patient recovers, the fees are gone. If, however, the doctor were paid by the State, he would hurry to get his patient cured and turned out to earn money. I am thankful to say that, as disclosed by the debate, this House can be unanimous on some questions. I wonder if those who talk about  " professional " medical men believe in amateur politicians. Politics is the science of government, and government is controlled by politics ; and there must be professionals in politics, as in other "callings, to make it a success. We do not pay the same .price to hear an ordinary singer that we pay to hear Madame Melba, simply because the latter is a professional. In the British House of Commons, the business is really carried on by about twenty-five members, who, out of the 600 odd members, may be regarded as professional politicians. </para>

It would seem, however, that the matter had practically been forgotten until I asked my questions. It is rather a pity that, instead of the long replies to those questions, I did not receive a simple "Yes" or "No," when probably there would have been no need to move the adjournment of the House. </para>

We were, therefore, unable to send our reports to him. We then sent a telephone message to .the Secretary to the Prime Minister, but he was absent on official business. Finally, we telegraphed to the Secretary for External Affairs, and asked if he would receive our reports on behalf of the Government. He said that he would, and shortly after 4 p.m. they were handed to him by the Assistant Secretary to the Tariff Commission. If the reports have been delayed in transmission to the Acting Prime Minister, the delay is not the fault of the free-trade members of the Tariff Commission. </para>

                        <para>.- I have listened with much interest and profit to the debate on the second reading of this Bill. Like many other honorable members, I think that it would have been better if the introduction of the measure had been deferred until after the settlement of the Tariff question. I think- that we should first have exhausted our powers of protecting and stimulating local production and manufacture by the imposition of duties, and then have proceeded, by the offering of bounties, to aid such industries as could not be assisted by the Tariff. I agree, too, with the honorable and learned  member for Flinders that, before putting these proposals before the House, the Government should have made a statement of rue financial position, though I take it that the honorable and learned member does not  regard  the fact that no such statement has been made as a vital objection to the measure. No doubt, the future expenditure of the Commonwealth is likely to be very large. There are great public works to be carried out, there may be a loss by the adoption of uniform postage, and huge liabilities will be incurred by the transfer of the Northern Territory. Probably the latter project will further involve the raising and spending of loan money. I hope that <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> the near future ,£2,000,000 or £3,000,000 will be expended in locking the rivers of the interior. </para>

                            <para>- Administration should be paid for out of revenue. I shall not allow the considerations which I have stated to prevent me from giving a cordial support to the measure. I believe that, by passing it, we shall lay the foundations of several important industries which will be entirely new to Australia. The details of the 'Bill will have to be threshed out in Committee, and therefore it is unnecessary to discuss them now. The opinion is generally held that most of the things mentioned in the schedule will grow prolifically in Australia, the only doubt being as to the possibility of their profitable production. I think that the genius of the British race will enable our people to display sufficient skill to bring this about. The cry that the competition of cheap labour elsewhere will make our efforts abortive has been heard throughout the debate. It has been raised, probably, by those who object to the principle of bounties, just as it was used prior to Federation by those who objected to the imposition of protective duties. To my knowledge, it has been made to do good service in Victoria for the last twenty-five or thirty years. When large areas in the northern parts of the State were about to be thrown open to agricultural settlement, it was stated bv newspaper , writers and public men that it would be impossible to grow wheat profitably there, in competition with the cheap labour of the  rvots  of India. Those statements were, in all probability, made bv persons who were interested in keeping the land as a sheep walk. Similarly it has been objected to the present proposals; that we cannot, in competition with the coloured labour of other countries, profitably produce the articles mentioned in the schedule. I think that this prediction will prove as melancholy a failure as that of which I have just spoken. When it. v.as proposed to legislate for the assistance- 0!." the great sugar industry of Queensland,, the arguments used in opposition were similar to those now being used in opposition to the proposed attempt to develop the cotton industry of that State. I see no reason why the cotton industry should not be as. great as the sugar industry is there, and when recently travelling in&gt; Queensland, I, as an Australian, felt proud that we have such an asset as the cane plantations which I saw. <inline font-style="italic">T</inline> hope that we shall not be content with <inline font-style="italic">se</inline> cramped policy, but will pass wise legislation to stimulate production, and bring into existence profitable primary industries; which are not now being followed in Australia. We have reached a critical stage; in our history. We possess a continent capable of producing almost everything that can be produced in  any  other part of the world, but our lands are, comparatively speaking, without population. We require more people, and our natural resources should enable us to feed an enormous population. It is  only  bv increasing our population that we can lessen the risk of invasion. </para>

                            <para>- It will help to do it. The policy which has made the United States of America what they are has aimed1 at making that  country,  so far as possible, self-sufficient and self-contained, so that it may be independent in times of stress and? emergency. The policy of preserving the home market has also made Germany one' of the leading competitors for the trade supremacy of the world. I am prepared1 to admit that there will be difficulties in the way of finding an export market for cotton and several other of the productions named in the schedule, which are grown with cheap labour in countries like the Straits Settlements, Egypt, and elsewhere; but we can, at least, preserve our home market for out people, and that market, if preserved, will consume our productions for a great  many  years to come. According to figures furnished by the Commonwealth Statistician. I find that we import annually over £6, 000,000 worth of the products covered by the schedule. </para>

                            <para>- Speaking in round numbers, our annual importation of cotton is valued at £64,000; of cordage and twine, at £522,000; of rice, at £248,000 ; of indiarubber goods, at £344,000 ; of cotton raw, waste, and wick, , £67,000; of socks and stockings, £150,000; of towels and handkerchiefs, £199,000 ; and of piece goods, cotton and linen, £3,309,000. Our importations of cotton goods alone are valued at £3,726,527. In jute goods we import bags and sacks consisting of bran, chaff, and fodder bags, to the value of £188,198 annually; corn and flour bags to the value of £617,866 ; gunny, potato, onion and coal bags to the value of £12, 038; ore bags to the value of £17,154; woolpacks to the value of £259,396 ; second-hand bags and sacks to the value of £2,487 ; and other bags to the value of £28,983, making a total expenditure in this direction of £1,126,126. Here is a fine field for exploiting the growth of the particular articles enumerated in the schedule of this Bill. I wish now to make a brief reference to the cotton industry, with a view to show that, from the standpoint of its volume, it might be made quite as valuable as is the sugar industry. I think that in Australia we produce over £3,000,000 worth of sugar annually. Certainly we manufacture all that we require for home consumption. We also import over £3,000,000 worth of cotton goods, either in a raw or in a manufactured state. </para>

                            <para>- As I have already said, the raw waste and wick imported is valued at £67,187, socks and stockings at £150,676, towels and handkerchiefs at £199,044, a total of piece goods, cotton and linen at £3,309,618. A good deal has been said during this debate about the cheap labour of the United States. Of the 7,000,000 persons who are engaged in the cotton industry there, a very large proportion of the growers are Europeans. We have it upon the authority of some who have written upon the subject that in the cotton fields of America, as in the sugar plantations of Queensland, one European can invariably do two or three times as much skilled work as can a coloured man. The picking of cotton in America is estimated to cost about½d. per lb. , which is the amount mentioned in the comprehensive report prepared by the Attorney-Gene ral, to whom great credit is due for the valuable compendium of information which he has given to us concerning this Bill. But the so-called cheap labour employed in the cotton fields of the United States is not as cheap as most persons imagine. A similar remark is applicable to the employment of kanakas in the sugar plantations of Queensland. When 1 passed through that State a few weeks ago, I made inquiries upon this point, and I learnt from several responsible employers that kanaka labour was not cheap. The truth is that when the kanaka had settled down to his work and realized the wages which had to be paid to white men engaged in the industry, he regulated his " stroke " so as to make it harmonize with the wage which he himself received. The chief advantage derived from the employment of kanakas in the plantations was that, because they were so thoroughly reliable, when the busy season came round ample labour was available to cut the cane. The policy of deporting these Pacific Islanders was, in my opinion, a wise one, but a mistake was made in repatriating 10,000 of them without supplying the requisite labour to take their places. I believe that if we wish to develop the cotton industry in Australia we shall have to introduce the principle that has been adopted upon the sugar plantations of Queensland. In other words, we shall have to establish the system of small holdings. There is no doubt that that system does not offer a complete cure for the labour difficulty, but it does offer something in that direction. My remarks upon this Bill have not been prompted by parochial considerations, although, as my electorate embraces about one-fifth of the State, of Victoria, and is wholly an agricultural district, I am naturally very much interested in it. In various spots along the Murray, we have splendid examples of intense culture. The same remark is applicable to places along the opposite bank in New South Wales. The Mildura. settlement is probably unique' in Australia. There we have a system of intense culture, chiefly for dried fruits, which will bear comparison with, the best equipped and most skilfully managed settlement in any part of the world. Many honorable members have taken the trouble to visit that settlement, and I should be very pleased to hear of any others who may be able to spare the necessary time to inspect it. Such a visit is in itself an education. </para>

                    <para class="block">Mildura is a settlement which has practically been dug out of the wilderness, and it has been developed to such an extent that it presents an object lesson in intense' culture which cannot be surpassed. This settlement is well worthy of preservation, and ought to be jealously guarded by the State if only on account of its intrinsic value. It is, however, invaluable as an object lesson of what can be done along the banks of our rivers, and as illustrating the almost illimitable possibilities of the fruit-growing industry and the practicability of establishing great irrigation colonies where intense culture can be carried on. </para>

                            <para>- It is successful mainly because it enjoys the benefit of a protective duty upon raisins. In this connexion I may mention that it has been wholly dependent upon that duty. It also enjoys -the protection which is afforded by an import duty upon currants. If these imposts were remitted the settlement would cease to be a success. Mildura, in short, affords a unique example of a community of British settlers - plucky, enterprising colonists - settling upon land in the centre of an Australian wilderness, imbued with free-trade ideas, and becoming converted to protection by the force of hard contact with the actual conditions of life. I am glad that this settlement is likely to receive some benefit from the proposed bounty upon dried fruit, &amp;c. Other industries which we might attempt to establish are those of jute and hemp. At the present time, we are importing no less than £1,126,126 worth of .cornsacks, woolpacks, chaff bags, potato bags, &amp;c. Here, then, is an industry of such dimensions that it might well engage the serious attention of this Chamber. As my own electorate is one of the largest, if not the largest of the wheat-growing districts in Victoria, I am naturally very much interested in this question just as representatives of other great wheat-growing centres are interested in it. For many years past the  cornsack  industry has been controlled by India.- The Indian market regulates the prices for the world. Now we have every reason to believe from information received through reliable commercial channels, that the wheat-growers of Australia are absolutely at the mercy of this  cornsack  combine in India. </para>

                            <para>- Of course we do not like combines, no matter where they exist. If a combine exists in our own midst, we can deal with it, whereas we cannot deal with combines abroad. With regard to sisal hemp, and the manufacture of cordage and twine, I may point out that we are, importing £500,000 worth of .these commodities per annum. I have no doubt from what I saw during my recent trip to the Northern Territory that we can produce these articles in abundance. In the northern portions of Australia jute' and hemp are growing almost wild. I hold in my hand samples of Mauritius hemp and sisal hemp. The larger parcel consists of sisal hemp, the fibre of which is about six feet long. This was grown on the experimental  plot connected with the Botanical Gardens in the Northern Territory. If honorable members will only take the trouble to inspect these beautiful samples, I am sure that the latter will speak very much more eloquently than any words of mine. </para>

                            <para>- We know very well that it is a very difficult matter for a man to start a new industry in a country where the conveniences of civilization are not great, and where access to market is not easy. If a -man be favorably situated, he can sometimes establish a business successfully without the aid of capital. But to do so requires a combination of extremely favorable circumstances. I have no doubt that this continent - if permitted to go along in its own way - would in course of time produce every product known to the world. But two or three centuries may elapse before that condition is realised. If we can expedite the establishment of these natural industries, it is our duty to do so. If we are possessed of the British pluck with which we ought to be endowed, one or two failures ought not to discourage us. If we look, at the number of persons who engage in business pursuits, we find that only a small percentage are successful. That fact, however, does not induce us to believe that business methods should be discontinued. </para>

                            <para>- Socialism is a term which nobody can define. The great Edmund Burke described the position very many years ago when he said it was beyond the judgment of any man to say where a line of demarcation could be drawn between State function and private enterprise. This is a question to be settled by the application, not of nebulous theoretical considerations, but by the common sense and good judgment of experienced legislators. I am quite prepared to favour State support to any industry that requires a stimulus, so long as I am satisfied that it is in the interests of the people as a whole that such encouragement should be given. But the question is one that must not be considered from a mere theoretical stand-point; it must be dealt with on a purely practical basis. Reference has been made to the establishment of a Federal Department of Agriculture. I am wholly in accord with that proposal. It was one of the planks of my election platform, and I have pleasure in indorsing the principle in the House to-day. The establishment of such a Department, before this Bill is passed, however, does not appear tome to be essentially necessary. More than one honorable member has referred to the work done by the Bureau of Agriculture in the United States of America, but we know that at the present time agricultural education in the United States is being disseminated both by the Federal power and the States Governments. The probability is that the operations of the States in their educational influences are just as far-reaching and as effective as are the more national operations of the Federal Department. </para>

                            <para>- But protective duties, which have, to a large extent, the same effect, are imposed. The growth of many of the products to which this Bill relates is stimulated in America by the operation of border Customs duties. To my mind, the chief utility of a Federal Department of Agriculture is that it would regulate our export trade. At the present time there are being exported from the different States goods bearing brands relating to those States. What we need to do is to secure uniform brands, and to raise the products of Australia to a certain standard to be recognised by a Commonwealth brand. In this way our products, when placed on the British market, would enjoy a much greater prestige than they secure as the products of individual States. </para>

                            <para>- It might be, but that is a matter of efficiency of administration. The Quarantine Bill, which was under consideration a few- days ago, provides also for stock inspection. I think that we should have Federal control and uniform laws in that respect. The technical education of the people throughout the various States, however, might very well be left for some considerable time to the Govern ments of the States. The Victorian Department of Agriculture has been most successful in the experimental work of the laboratory, and also in the dissemination of technical knowledge throughout the agricultural districts of the State. It has likewise done valuable and lasting work by means of experimental plots, and I hold that technical education, and the dissemination of scientific agricultural knowledge generally, might very well be left to the various States- I should like to conclude with a brief reference to the question of afforestation, which was dealt with by the Attorney-General in the course of the admirable speech which he made in moving the second reading of the Bill. The work is one that must be left for some time to the States, since they own the land, their position in that regard being very different from the States of America. But if a reference in this House to such a work will tend to stimulate the States into action, much good will be done. The Forestry Department is one of the most important and lucrative in Germany, France, Norway, Switzerland, and Russia, and the probability is that of all the leading nations of the world, the Anglo-Saxon race has been the most backward in the work of forest conservation. I understand that when the Bill is under consideration in Committee we shall have an opportunity to freely exercise our rights to vote for or against any item in the schedule, but with its general principle - the principle of granting bounties - I am i'.i hearty accord. </para>

                        <para>. - To my mind this Bill is good in its intentions, but very awkward in its incidence, and that which it is sought to accomplish by it could be best secured by what is known as " the new protection." The bounty system seems to cast on the Government the onus of determining what new products shall be selected for cultivation here, and it virtually amounts to a speculation with the people's money, a speculation from which the people obtain no return, the individual securing the exclusive benefit. The honorable member for Wimmera has referred to the necessity for encouraging by monetary aid the growth of new industries, but to my mind the object which we have in view could best be obtained by the establishment of a State Bank, which would be in a position to furnish assistance to the .pioneers in these ventures when they were most in need of it. Under the Bill, as it stands, the struggle and the stress of the work associated with these experiments is to be endured by those who engage in them before the Government comes to their aid. A State bank, however, would provide a solution of the difficulty. The system has been successfully tried in New Zealand, and I feel confident that the pioneers who were assisted by means of a State Bank would readily recognise their obligations to it. The knowledge of what they owed to it would be to them an incentive to success. Under the aegis of the Government there would be no fear of such an institution bringing undue pressure to bear upon those who were engaged in these industries. The means of encouragement provided for in this Bill are to my mind intricate if not unconstitutional. As a' condition precedent to the founding of a State Bank with the object of assisting those who embarked upon new enterprises, I should like the policy of the new protection to be adopted by the Commonwealth, and in that way a recognised means of encouraging such industries as it is desirable to foster here would be employed. No more effective means of stimulating such industries could be found than is supplied by the raising of the Tariff to an effective level of protection, and by opening up our natural opportunities. We hear a great deal about the necessity for advertising Australia, and various fanciful schemes of publishing abroad what can be done here are from time to time put forward. It seems to me, however, that if natural opportunities to settle here are offered the white citizens of other lands, nothing more will be necessary. When a new gold-field is discovered in Australia a rush immediately takes place,, and we do not find it necessary to advertise the new find in the London <inline font-style="italic">Times.</inline> And so if it were known that we had in other than the tropical parts of Australia thousands of acres of arable land, ready for settlement, possessed of good railway service, and in proximity to a market, that land would be immediately rushed. If, instead of compelling people, as we do nowadays, to gamble for a piece of land, we were able to offer a block to any decent white citizen who chose to apply for it the necessity to encourage our industries would largely disappear. I favour the policy of protection, because I believe that, without it, an attempt to start an industry in a new country is immediately met by an effort to swamp it on the part of those who have established it in other lands. We have heard to-day of the cheap labour of other lands, but we have no fear of cheap labour in protected countries. The cry that has been raised that it would be impossible for us to cope with the cheap labour employed in many primary industries in eastern countries is more or less a fiction. Cheap labour does not necessarily mean cheap goods. Although in those countries cheap labour is employed in the production of such goods as rubber, jute, and cotton, the goods themselves are not allowed to become cheap. The trade in them is regulated and cornered. But if, in the absence of protective duties, we attempted to produce these goods in Australia, the manufacturers there who are able to command a full supply of cheap coloured labour would materially reduce their prices, with the result that it would be almost impossible to found the industry here. I do not wish it to be understood for one moment that I am weakening in my adhesion- to the principle of a White Australia. My object is merely to show that the cheap labour of eastern countries has not, in itself, resulted in cheap products, and that, if we could  obtain a fair price for tobacco, rubber, cotton, and other products mentioned in the schedule, it would pay us to raise them in Australia. I recognise the necessity for protection, because of the inevitable competition that would otherwise ensue as soon as we attempted to cultivate these products here. I subscribe entirely to the policy of protection as being the more constitutional means of aiding Australian progression, whilst I think that our efforts in this direction would be materially assisted by the establishment of a State bank, and the opening up of the natural opportunities offering in even the tropical areas of Australia. It is all very well to talk of granting bounties now ; but the time is not opportune for the application of the system to the enterprises covered by the Bill. We have made no provision for the growth of many of these products, and some time must elapse before this Bill can operate to materially assist those who enter upon these undertakings. If we had a State bank there would be no need for the proposed bounties. The establishment of a State bank, together with the adoption of the policy of the new protection and the giving of natural opportunities to the people to enter upon these enterprises, is all that we require. </para>

                        (Brisbane) [5.14]. - I have no desire to prolong this debate, but, since I fmd myself in somewhat of a difficulty ^ I am unwilling to give a silent vote on the motion for the second reading of this Bill. I desire at the outset to make reference to the point raised by the honorable member Tor Parramatta and others that the time is inopportune for the introduction of this Bill, since the Tariff proposals of the Government have not yet been, submitted. I shall not repeat the reasons which were given by those honorable members, who placed their arguments before the House far more lucidly than I should probably do. I should like to say, however, that I was deeply impressed by the cogency of the reasons which they advanced ; and, if there were a motion for the postponement of the further consideration of this Bill, until after the Tariff has been debated, I should undoubtedly vote for it. But there is another reason, which, though I do not think it was specially mentioned by those honorable members, presents itself to me as one for postponing the Bill. A number of the products which are set forth in the schedule may be made the subject of protective duties under the

                    <para class="block">Tariff ; and it is' desirable that we should know exactly what the Government intentions are in regard to those products before we attempt to legislate as to bounties. 1 shall take only the one instance of raw coffee. Under the old Queensland Tariff, which was strongly protective of this product, the production' of coffee was advancing in the most gratifying way. A number of plantations were started, and there was every indication that they would be eminently successful. But the duty was reduced ; and I believe I am correct in saying that there is now only one plantation, namely, that at Kuranda, which, probably, some honorable members have visited. </para>

                    <para>Colonel FOXTON.- I am not aware of the fact ; at all events, a number of plantations have gone out of cultivation. I am not in a position to give figures, but the production of coffee has necessarily been materially reduced, and a thriving and valuable industry practically obliterated. It is now proposed to give a bounty on the production of raw coffee to the extent of a id. per lb., up to <inline font-style="italic">£*i5°o</inline> a year for eight years. </para>

                    <para>Colonel FOXTON.- So it was alleged by the growers. But, curiously enough, not only the reduction of the Tariff, but the abolition of the duty on tea materially affected the production of raw coffee. The tea became cheaper, and it was alleged by the coffee-growers that that resulted in a less demand for coffee. I do not know how far the coffee-growers were correct, but that was the  statement  made to me by some of those who went out of the industry, and particularly by one man at Kuranda who is still growing coffee. I hold that, as a general principle, in a country where there are protective duties, it is fair and reasonable, in regard to products which are, or are likely to be, in the bulk produced for export only, to give a bonus to compensate those engaged for the high prices which the incidence of protection in other directions imposes on them. Coffee, however, we can never hope to export; there is a larger demand within the limits of Australia than can possibly be met for, probably generations by' any system we can adopt for the encouragement of its production. It is doubtful whether the proposed bounty would be as beneficial in the encouragement of the industry as a protective duty would be, bearing in mind the fact that the bounty is for the limited period of eight years. For this reason, I hold that, in the case of coffee, for instance, we ought to know what are the intentions of the Government in regard to the imposition of a protective duty. If this Bill were passed with the schedule in its present form, I can quite understand that, when the Tariff came up for consideration, strong objection might be made to granting that protection which I hold is essential to make the coffee-growing industry profitable in Australia on the ground that it had been already provided for by way of bounty. That is an additional reason why it is particularly desirable that we should have the whole of the Tariff proposals of the Government before us when we are considering this Bill. I have referred to a difficulty in which I find myself in connexion with the support I propose to give to the measure. The difficulty arises from the fact that in Queensland there have been granted, at various times, bonuses or bounties for the production of articles of commerce, and, with one exception, they have been complete failures ; that is to say, they have failed in permanently establishing the industries they were designed to encourage. And yet I do not feel justified in opposing this Bill, which is designated to encourage industries nearly all of which are peculiarly suited to the State of which I am a representative. </para>

                        That is a totally different matter. I am speaking of unfettered production, and the bonus to which the honorable member refers is for a particular class of labour. I may deal with the point later on, but it is outside the scope of my argument at the present time. I am speaking of the bounties proposed by this Bill ; and here I should like to say that there appears to me a distinction which may be drawn between bonuses and bounties. I do not know that there is any real difference; but, especially in Queensland legislation, a distinction has been made. It has been urged that the success of the bounty system in connexion with the best-sugar industry in Europe is a complete answer to those who have doubts as to the efficacy of granting bounties such as are proposed in the Bill. But there is an inherent and essential difference between the two systems. The bonuses proposed in the Bill are to last over periods varying from five years, as a minimum, to fifteen years, as the maximum, olives being fixed at the maximum period; because, as I understand, it takes ten years for the trees to bear.

                        - I have had no experience myself, but if the honorable member for Riverina is correct, there would remain ten years for the operation of the bounty. In any case, the period is limited, and it is hoped that by the granting of the bounties the industries, whatever they may be, will be able to stand on their own feet without assistance after that period. The bounty system which has been adopted in connexion with the beet-sugar industry in Europe is of a totally different character. It is, apparently, admitted on all hands that it is necessary to there have that bounty permanently ; and the success of a temporary measure cannot be gauged by the success which has attended the permanent system on the Continent of Europe. One honorable member asked what was the good of granting bounties since there is no land to be had. That is news to me, coming, as I do, from Queensland, with its huge areas of agricultural land in districts which have a splendid rainfall. There is land in Queensland to be had at 2s. 6d. an acre, with ten years to pay, in instalments of 3d. per acre.

                    <para>Colonel FOXTON.- Certainly not; it is as fine land as can be found in the world. The one condition which is imposed on the granting of the land at such a low rate is that the holder shall permanently reside on it for five years; personal  residence is the one test, and if it be complied with a man can get 160 acres of magnificent land for the price I have mentioned. What is wanted is population. The honorable member for South Sydney said he knew of numbers of people who were leaving the southern parts of Australia to take up land in the northern parts. That, of course, is desirable from our northern point of view, but it is not desirable from the point of view from which we, representing Australia as a whole, should regard the circumstance. I should prefer to see Queensland peopled, not at the expense of our southern neighbours, but by immigrants from over the seas. I have noticed from the reports of deputations upon Ministers that there is unfortunately a strong objection on the part of a large section of the community to the immigration of any but person's who will immediately settle upon our lands. </para>

During the debate a good deal has been said about the cotton industry ; but many of those who have spoken were unfortunately supplied only with the report of the Conference of experts, and had not in their possession the supplementary reports of the Queensland Agricultural Department. Consequently they expressed serious doubts as to the advisability of granting a bounty for the production of cotton. Had they read the reports of the Queensland experts, and known, as I do, that any one of these experts has more practical knowledge of cotton growing than all the others put together, they would have arrived at a different conclusion. I should like to read the following table supplied by the Queensland Department, which shows the cost of production, average yield, market price, and net profit per acre of cotton when grown in that State under ordinary favorable conditions of soil, rainfall, and good cultivation - </para>

                        The only point upon which I express any doubt is as to the cost of picking, which is set down at |d. per lb. In my youth I have picked cotton more or less as a pastime, and know that, thirty-five or  forty years ago, the price invariably paid for picking was id. per lb. Still, the table I have read was prepared by men of considerable experience. A special report has been furnished by

                        Jones, who to-day is. probably one of the best authorities on cotton growing in Australia.  His  father, whom I knew many years ago, was a farmer at

As the history .of cotton growing in Queensland has been referred to by several speakers, I may be pardoned for giving it at some length, especially as at least one honorable member has expressed the desire that I should do so. In the early sixties a bonus for the production of cotton was given by the Government of Queensland - 1 think in the shape of a money order which would be accepted in payment for Crown lands under certain conditions of alienation. The export of cotton from the State began in 1861, and in 1862 14,000 lbs. were exported. Six years later the exportation had risen to 2,000,000 lbs., and three years later still - in 1871 - to over 2,500,000 lbs., valued at £80,000. </para>

                    <para>Colonel FOXTON. - The price of cotton rose considerably during the war. By 1888 the exportation of cotton from Queensland had dwindled to 43,000 lbs., showing that the industry could not keep going without the assistance of a bonus, and during times of low prices. </para>

                        I was about to refer to that. During the time of which I am speaking great heaps of cotton seed, probably amounting to thousands of tons, went to waste, as sawdust goes to waste to-day. It was almost impossible for the cotton ginners to get rid of it. The popular idea was that it made good manure; but I did not find that to be so. At any rate, any one who would cart it away was welcome to do so. To-day, however, there is almost as much money to be made from cotton seed as from cotton, because of its value for the production of oil. We have been informed that Messrs. Kitchen and Sons have an establishment for the manufacture of oil, and that other firms are making inquiries into  the advisability of doing so, so that there is every prospect that the stimulation given by a bounty and the value of by-products will cause the industry, when taken up again, to prove a success. In 1905, there were 1.71 acres under cotton in Queensland, while in the previous year the area was only thirty acres. This year, however, 500 acres have been cultivated, and the giving of a bounty should stimulate growers to still further exertions. Notwithstanding the previous failure of the industry, there is now a fair prospect of its being, established on a satisfactory basis. The later developments in the cotton industry in Queensland were due to the fact that some few years ago a bonus of £5,000- was offered for the first five thousand yards of cotton goods manufactured there. A company was (formed, and a mill was. started at Limestone, just outside the town of Ipswich. Operations were carried
                        <inline font-style="italic">on</inline>
                        for some time, until the bonus had been earned,, and then the mill closed down, owing to a variety of reasons. One of these was that the farmers could not be induced to grow cotton to the extent necessary to keep the mill employed. Other reasons were also advanced. It was alleged that the drought had something to do with the discontinuance of operations, and also the fact that other crops could be grown, at greater profit. Further, it was stated that the mill was started with insufficient capital. Be that as it may, there is the mill waiting to convert the cotton which we are able to produce into calico and other goods. My own experience leads me to believe that cotton cannot be grown in Australia in large areas under present labour conditions. It is an article which can he produced only as subsidiary to other farm products, because the picking of cotton - as is mentioned in the report of the Queensland expert - is employment which is most suited to women and children. They make really better pickers than do men, because their fingers can get further into the cotton bolls. It will be only the small grower with a family in a position to pick the few acres of cotton which he is able to cultivate, who will be able to make a success of this product.
                        <inline font-style="italic">I</inline>
                        am glad to see that in the Bill provision is made that the employment of aborigines shall not prevent the payment of bounties: upon the production of any of the articles specified in the schedule, f am particularly pleased that this is so, because there are no better cotton pickers than are the aborigines. There is one provision in the Bil! which I think is likely to prove somewhat of a trap to growers of many of these products. I allude to the provision which invests the Minister with power to withhold' the bounty in respect of any goods which have been produced if he considers that » fair rate of wages has not been paid.

                        - I was not aware of that, because I had not compared the two. If the provision be administered in the same way that the regulation regarding labour in- the cane-fields has been administered, no great exception can be taken to it. But I would point out that in the latter case the rate of wage is laid down before the cane is cut, whereas in this Bill no mention is made that the rate of wage shall be specified in advance. On the contrary, the Minister may step in at any time and say to a grower, " I do not consider that the rate of wage paid by you was fair, and therefore I shall not grant you the bounty." If, however, the provision is administered upon similar lines to the Sugar Bounty Act very little exception can be taken to it. Whilst speaking of the way in which the regulation regarding the employment of labour upon the sugar plantations has been administered, I wish to point to one pit-fall which should be very carefully avoided by the Minister. In a huge territory such as Queensland - to say nothing of the whole of Australia - care should be taken not to lay down one standard wage for the whole area. It seems to me that to do so would be to ignore patent facts. What is a fair wage in the south of Queensland is by no means a fair wage in the far north.

                        - I am not discussing the amount, but rather the principle that is involved. The honorable member has not been following my remarks. I was hoping that I had made myself intelligible to everybody. I merely instanced the regulation framed in connexion with the Sugar Bounty Bill, which provides that 2'2s. 6d. shall be the rate of wage for the whole of Queensland and the northern portion of New South Wales. I say that the method adopted in dealing with this question is not a practicable one. It may happen that £1 per week is a fair wage in one district, whilst 25s. is only a fair wage in another district. These facts should be borne in mind. I hold in my hand a copy of a letter which was' written by a farmer on the Darling Downs, where, of course, sugar cannot be grown. In it he states that the effect of offering 22s. 6d. per week with rations for labourers in the canefields has been to deplete the Downs of agricultural labourers, who have gone into the neighbouring district of Bundaberg, where they are able to command more wages.

Probably it is not sufficient in the northern portions of Queensland, while it may be too much in the southern portions of that State. I repeat that farm labourers axe being attracted from the wheat-growers on the Darling Downs into the adjacent district of Bundaberg, with the result that the farmers are not able to get as much labour for harvesting purposes as they have hitherto done. </para>

                        I am sure the honorable member for Cook will admit that it would be worth more to work in the canefields or coffee-plantations of Port Darwin than it is to work in Brisbane.

I hope that the honorable member will now be satisfied. If he questions my statement he is at liberty to do so.

                        Sugar is grown south of Brisbane. Cane is being grown upon my own land. I hope that I have said sufficient to indicate to the Minister that it is extremely undesirable to fix a standard wage which shall operate uniformly throughout the States or throughout any huge district in which any one of these products may be grown. It almost necessarily follows from varying conditions as to population, climate, and the cost of living, that what is a fair wage in one district may not be a fair wage in another.

                        <para>.- I have listened very attentively during this debate to the arguments which have been adduced, both in favour of, and in opposition to, the introduction of this Bill, and I fail to see any particular necessity for its introduction at the present stage. In moving the second reading of the measure, the Attorney-General declared that his desire was to encourage agriculture in the Commonwealth. We all wish to do that. When, however, the honorable and learned gentleman was asked to show how this Bill would encourage agriculture, he studiously refrained from answering. To my mind, it is extremely doubtful whether this or any other Bounty Bill will encourage agricultural pursuits to any appreciable' extent. </para>

                            <para>- I was not then a member of this Legislature. The effect of this Bill will not be what is desired, and I also think that the time is  inopportune for its introduction. It may be that it is thrown out as a sort of sop to some agriculturists in anticipation of the imposition of yet heavier duties under the new Tariff that we are to have some day. The Government so far has not shown itself very anxious to assist the agriculturist unless the piling up of increased duties on almost every implement that he uses can be deemed encouragement. The consideration that appeals most to my mind, however, is that advanced by the honorable and learned member for Flinders, and which may be described as the financial argument. The only answer given on behalf of the Government is that made by their loyal and faithful supporter the honorable member for Gippsland, who declared that they were perfectly justified in asking us to vote these bounties regardless of what funds might remain for any other purpose. Such an argument is, to my mind, that of the prodigal and the spendthrift rather than of a man of business. The argument as to where the money is to come from appeals to some of us very strongly because of our personal experiences. Various things which seemed very desirable have come before us from time to time, but when we have been met with the financial argument we have been forced to put them aside for a more convenient season. We must recognise that we have to face a decreasing revenue. If the statements made during the last general election campaign mean anything we are going to have  effective protection. The further we go in that direction the less revenue we shall obtain from our Customs duties. We have to face not only a decreased revenue but a largely increased expenditure. On almost every hand we are told that our expenditure is to be increased. We have already agreed to a considerable expenditure in connexion with the transcontinental railway survey, and if that work be carried out, it will probably lead to the expenditure of a very much larger sum. Then again, if we take over the Northern Territory, we shall have at the outset to face a deficit of between £180,000 and £200,000 a year on the cost of its administration. We are told also that we need an increased expenditure - and I think we dc- - on our defences. The Royal Commission appointed to inquire into the administration of Papua has likewise reported that if that Territory is to be administered effectually, we must be prepared to make a largely increased grant in that direction. Then we have the proposal of the Postmaster-General to introduce penny postage, and that, if adopted, will make a difference  in our revenue. Without repeating the arguments which the honorable and learned member for Flinders so well put forward, I mav say that I think we might well wait until the Treasurer submits his financial statement before dealing with this Bill. I am at one with the honorable member for Parramatta in the belief that if the Government have money to expend in this way, they might employ it far more effectively in establishing a Federal Department of Agriculture. The honorable member for Laanecoorie said that the Bill was to encourage agriculture more particularly in the temperate regions. Most of the products mentioned in the schedule, however, are tropical productions, and- in regard to all of them we should have to compete successfully with the productions of Asia and its islands. I believe with the honorable member who has charge of "this Bill that in the northern parts Of Australia we have many acres suitable for the production of rice. But should we ever be able to produce rice so cheaply as to compete successfully with the cheap labour employed in the rice fields of China, Korea, Japan, and other nations? I think it very doubtful. Notwithstanding the remark made by the honorable member who has just resumed his seat, I am. very doubtful whether we can establish the cotton industry in Australia. An attempt in that direction, however, appeals strongly to me. In common with all manufacturing countries, we are anxious that the monopoly at present held by the southern States of America should be broken down. But here again we are confronted with the labour problem. Hand labour is still very largely used in the production of cotton.

                    <para>The diminution in time that has taken place has been almost entirely in connexion with the early cultivation of the cotton, and not in the picking and harvesting of the crop. Proposals have been, and are still being, made to apply mechanical devices to the picking of cotton, but so far as -I know no such device has yet proved successful. Black labour is still a most important factor in the cultivation of cotton in America, and the black labour problem is that which we have to solve before we can hope to introduce these tropical cultivations into Australia. The Attorney-General quoted from <inline font-style="italic">Cotton</inline> a passage showing that white farmers and their families have been successful in the production of cotton on small farms in America. I think that is true ; but still white farmers having no families almost universally employ the black man, or the black man's children, to pick the cotton. When we find that white children are being employed, even by their own parents, in doing this kind of work, we are reminded of what has been a very vital problem in the history of the United States - the problem of child labour. During the depression in the cotton trade in America - a depression that extended over ten years, but has fortunately passed away - many of these smaller white farmers, and their families, forsaking their holdings, took up their residence in towns where the children, who were formerly employed in the picking of cotton, were to a large extent drafted into cotton factories, thus rendering more acute the problem of child labour in that branch of the industry. I do not wish to see anything of the kind happening in connexion with our Australian  children. There is a good deal in the song of the old darkie - </para>

In that work there is a chapter dealing with the possibilities of the competition of other countries in the growth of cotton, and a quotation from it may be welcome to the House. The writer shows, in the first place, that the competition comes principally from India and the East Indies, from Egypt and Brazil, but that the southern States still supply more than three-fourths of the world's demand for cotton, and that they have practically a monopoly in that respect.

                    <para class="block">There is only one other aspect of the question which I should like to bring before honorable members. When we deal with the encouragement of these tropical productions, we are faced with the question of what is to be our policy in regard to the development of Papua. I think every honorable member realizes the great necessity there is for the proper administration of that country. The attitude of the Imperial Government towards the Commonwealth and this Parliament in regard to the other British Possessions in the seas around us, may, to a great extent, depend on the success with which we administer this, our first, external territory. Before we can effectually deal with the Bounties Bill we must ascertain what the policy of the Commonwealth Government is, not only in regard to the Tariff concessions, but in regard to the whole administration of that territory.. Most of those tropical productions - rubber, cocoa-nuts, copra, coffee and jute - have been urged by the Royal Commission as suitable for cultivation in Papua.

                        <para>.- It is not my intention to unduly prolong' the debate; but as I have always favoured any means of increasing primary production, I feel constrained to offer a few remarks on the motion for the second reading of the Bill. As on former occasions, the House seems to be divided into three parties in regard to the measure. There is, first, the party which is opposed to the giving of encouragement to Australian industries. It objects to the Bill, not because of its details, but because of its aim. The second party, while speaking in favour of the development of our industries, makes the excuse that the time is not opportune for the granting of bounties. When will it be opportune, if it is not so now ? In two previous Parliaments attempts have been made to encourage primary production in this way, but without success, because of the opposition offered to them. Now, however, the people have spoken in favour of legislation of this kind, and Members of Parliament have had six years in which to consider what action they shall take. The third party is composed of the supporters of the Bill. In former days the members of the Opposition, when members of State Parliaments, used to say that they were opposed to the imposition of Customs duties, believing that the proper way in which to encourage the establishment of new -industries was to offer bounties or subsidies ; but now that it is proposed to offer bounties, they say, " The time is not opportune. We must first know what Customs duties are to be imposed." Therefore, we cannot look to them for assistance in regard to the Bill. But it will ill-become those who have pledged themselves to assist in the establishment of new industries tr&gt; say that the time is not opportune for doing so. There is no time like the present, and I hope that Ministers will go on. with the. Bill until it is passed into law. I was surprised to hear the honorable member for Nepean, who claims to be a free-trader, say that, had the Government proposed a bounty for the production and manufacture of iron, he would have supported it. Surely we have not come to this, that if the industries which would benefit a member'sown constituents are not to be assisted, he will not support recommendations for the assistance of industries in other constituencies. A great deal has been said upon the labour question. Thirty or forty years ago it was declared by interested persons that only a madman would attempt to grow wheat in Riverina; that it would not pay to grow wheat there. Similar statements have been made during this debate. Indeed, so much has been said about cheap labour that one might be excused for believing that certain honorable members are of the opinion that if we cannot produce certain things in Australia without the aid' of imported cheap labour, we should not attempt to produce them at all. I am one of those who think that Australia should' produce all that it requires for its own needs. I believe that there is sufficient white labour available for that purpose, and that if it is paid a fair wage the whole community will benefit. An argument which is often used against Customs duties is that they increase the burdens of the taxpayers. No doubt, if duties are placed upon the importation of articles which cannot be manufactured or produced locally the importers increase their prices to the disadvantage of" the consumers ; but numberless instances in Victoria and New South Wales make it plain that, if internal production or manufacture is increased by the stimulus of protective duties, importers are compelled to reduce their prices in order to keep their goods in the market. Members of the Opposition have spoken of the attempts of" the Victorian Parliament to assist the people - of' the State as failures. It is true that much of the money expended in carrvingOUt irrigation works has been lost, but, ' nevertheless, the educational value of the-  enterprise to the agriculturists of the State and the community at large has been very great. . It is true, too, that bounties were not given for the encouragement of settlement in Mildura, but had not the Victorian Government come to the aid of the settlers there, not one would be found at Mildura to-day. </para>

                            <para>- Yes ; but the present condition of that settlement is a proof of the advantages to be obtained by a community from wise legislation for the encouragement of primary productions. The agriculturists of Australia are admirable men, for whom I have the greatest respect, but they belong to a most conservative class. It is very difficult to make them move out of their groove; in fact, they will not do so unless it is demonstrated to them beyond the possibility of doubt that they .can engage in more profitable work than they are doing. If the Commonwealth Parliament can by its legislation, induce them to move out of their groove, they will eventually admit that they were under a misapprehension as to our intentions, and that they have profited' immensely as the result of our action. It is proposed to give encouragement to the growing of flax. If the agriculturists of Victoria were asked whether flax will grow in the northern parts of this State, they would say "No"; yet in the electorate of Indi a farmer, who is a little ahead of his class, has demonstrated to his own satisfaction and that of others, that twice as much can be made by growing flax as by growing wheat. It is our duty to make the farmers understand that there is no difficulty about growing flax, neither a special soil, a specia.1 climate, nor special labour being required. Any farmer who can grow wheat can grow flax. The seed is sown in the same way, reaped, harvested, and stacked like hay, and the fibre now prepared by machinery instead of by the old method of retting, or steeping in water. I saw it stated about the end of last year, in a Melbourne newspaper, that flax was being grown at Barnawartha, and thereupon put myself into communication with the grower. I ascertained from him how the crop is sown, cultivated, and harvested. He is cultivating in a light soil, and informed me that any land which will grow wheat will grow flax. His experience shows that the cost of sowing, harvesting with reaper and binder, and stacking is not more than the cost of growing, reaping, and stacking hay, while the  value  of the flax is £4 a ton, and the crop averages 30 cwt. to the acre, so that the return is <inline font-style="italic">j£6</inline> to the acre. Surely we shall do good if, by offering bounties, we stimulate a large number of farmers to grow flax, and thus enable the) Commonwealth to pro- duce fibre instead of sending immense sums of money abroad to purchase it. With regard to the growing of cotton, members have spoken as if Queensland is the only State where cotton can be grown; but, as a matter of fact, it will grow as well in New South Wales and in Victoria. I have here a small sample, part of which I exhibited when the last Bounty Bill was before us, which has been submitted to experts in Melbourne and in London. The cotton produced was grown without artificial aid such as irrigation, the seed being sown in October, and the crop harvested in February. It was grown at  Coolnong  between Narrandera and Jerilderie, in New South Wales, ,and there are millions of acres in Riverina and on the Victorian side of the Murray consisting of the same soil and possessing the same climate. Some honorable members have asked why these commodities are not extensively cultivated in Australia. My reply is that until we offer some encouragement to persons to engage in these industries we cannot expect them to do so. If we can induce them to undertake the production of these commodities, they will benefit, themselves primarily, but the people of Australia as a whole will also be advantaged to a very great extent. What I have said in regard to cotton and flax might with equal appropriateness be said of jute. I .should also like to see silk included in the items enumerated in the schedule to this Bill. I maintain that silk can be produced in Australia of equal quality to that produced in any part of the world. Its culture is simplicity itself. An innocent-looking worm has merely to be fed upon mulberry leaves, and we are all aware that the mulberry tree will grow in almost any portion of Australia. Seeing that these industries have not been established up to the present time, I think that the Government are acting wisely in endeavouring to foster them. When they have been firmly established, the bounties which it is proposed to grant may be withdrawn, and protective duties substituted for them. I am also in thorough accord with the Government upon the question of the class of labour to be employed in these industries. No syndicate should be permitted to employ cheap labour. As I understand the Government intend defraying the expenses of honorable members who wish to inspect eligible sites for the Federal Capital at Canberra and other places, I should be most pleased to conduct a parliamentary  party  to the River Murray, with a view to showing honorable members places upon that waterway which has been so long neglected, where tea and rice are being grown to-day. </para>

                            <para>- Yet the honorable member has not seen those commodities growing there. In considering this Bill, it seems to me that we have merely to ask ourselves whether we favour encouraging Australian industries in order that the people of the Commonwealth may be supplied with their own productions, or whether we prefer to continue sending millions sterling out of Australia every year to provide labour elsewhere, whilst our own workmen are being neglected. It is only . by the imposition of Customs duties, or by the payment of bounties, that new industries can be established. Some honorable members are in doubt as to which of the two alternatives they ought to support. Personally, I am prepared to support either or both, and I am satisfied that whatever sacrifice we may make to encourage local production will be amply repaid by way of increased prosperity to our own people. </para>

                        <para>.- Last evening some Ministerial supporters took it upon themselves to lecture honorable members upon this side of the House because of the attitude which they have adopted towards this Bill. They twitted them with inconsistency because some members of the corner upon this side of the Chamber who favour the granting of bounties under certain conditions are of opinion that the present is not an opportune time to bring forward this measure, and that it would be more business-like to consider it in the light of the new Tariff. </para>

                            <para>- I shall state the attitude which I intend to adopt towards the Bill in no uncertain terms. Amongst those who particularly censured members' of the Opposition was the honorable member for Gippsland, who seems to have arrogated to himself the position of lecturer-general to members of this House. That is a trivial circumstance that we can afford to smile at as a not unfamiliar form of arrogance which is occasionally displayed by new members. But seeing the particular time at which, these objections were urged, it occurred to me that some honorable members desired to give the cue to a certain section of the press to raise a storm, of protest against the action of members of the Opposition. At any rate, I have observed that the hint was acted upon. The honorable member for Riverina has charged certain honorable members with being opposed to the encouragement of Australian industries under any circumstances. That accusation certainly cannot apply to myself, or to any of those with whom I am associated. 1 am perfectly satisfied that members of the Opposition are just as anxious as is the honorable member himself to see Australian industries encouraged. What we object to is the encouragement of some industries at the expense and to the discouragement of others. We do not object to industries being encouraged, but we do object to the means by which it is proposed to encourage them. </para>

                            <para>- There is a way to encourage them by inducing people to become more self-reliant, and not so prone to lean upon the Government for support. That is the way to encourage healthy development. It is notorious that the industries which thrive best in all countries are those which have been established without any assistance from the State. The proper way to encourage industries is to see that land is made available for the people to settle upon, that fair conditions are granted, and that there is as little State interference with them as possible.  Upon  the question of bounties I have always made my position perfectly clear. I object to the payment of bounties save under exceptional conditions when it can be shown that by granting them some great national undertaking will be benefited, from which the whole people will reap a. proportionate advantage. </para>

                            <para>- Without committing myself to any particular industry or scheme, I might instance work connected  with national defence, in which an immense amount of capital might have to be risked for the public benefit. In some exceptional circumstances to grant bounties may be defensible. But there is no justification for granting them simply to encourage private enterprise in ordinary commercial ventures. My objections to the bounty system are cf a three- fold character. In the first place I object to it upon the ground of principle I fail to see how bounties which are granted to private individuals at the expense of the general taxpayer can be defended upon the ground of ethics or logic or from the stand-point of national advantage. My second objection is . that bounties which are granted: to industries that can be profitably established in our midst are a waste of public money. There is no justification whatever for paying bounties to thriving industries. My third objection is that bounties which are granted to industries which it is alleged cannot thrive without them also involve a waste of public money. It is obvious that there could be no advantage to the State, seeing that the Government would have to pay the piper in both cases without deriving any benefit'. Money so expended would result in an absolute loss. The honorable member for Riverina told us just now that cotton, flax, and silk could be successfully produced here, and stated that flax could be cultivated more profitably than wheat in districts where the farmers were devoting their attention to the production of the last-named commodity. If that be so, why do not the farmers forsake the cultivation of wheat for that of flax? </para>

                            <para>- Then, obviously he has only to be told about it. If we can show the wheat farmer that it is better for him  to devote his land to flax culture - and- that the: areas: now being devoted by him to the growth of wheat can be turned to more profitable account by the production of flax - he will quickly take the hint. The farmers on the northern rivers of New South Wales, who at one time devoted almost the whole of their attention .to- the growth of sugar-cane, did not hesitate to take up dairy farming when it was pointed out that it would be more profitable for them to do so. Nowadays, sugar growing in those districts has  Deen  almost entirely deserted' in favour of. dairy farming. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot say; but I do know that it was found that dairy farming was more profitable than sugar growing there. I take it that bounties are generally, offered only to encourage the investment of capital in new industries. Under this Bill, however, they are to be offered for the growth of produce that has already been raised, and raised profitably, in Australia. I fail to see why we should be asked to grant a bounty in respect of an industry that is already being profitably carried on in Australia. The production of cotton comes within this category. In the report of the Conference of experts, we find statements inconsistent with those appearing in the reports received from Queensland. For example, in the first paragraph of their report on cotton we have the statement - </para>

                    <para class="block">If the prospects of the industry are not specially promising, there can be no ground for recommending the payment of a bounty for its encouragement. On the face of it, the report is so discouraging that to recommend the payment of a bounty in such circumstances seems to be little short of madness.

                        <para>Except for the fact that cotton seed has recently become valuable because of the oil that can be extracted from it, and the cake which can be manufactured from the residues, the cotton industry would be utterly without hope in Australia. </para>

                    <para class="block">In these circumstances, it is most remarkable that the conference should have recommended the payment of a bounty for the encouragement of the industry.

According to those reports) cotton has been produced in Queensland since- i860. It was grown in the first instance as the result of a bonus offered by the State Government, and the industry was carried on during' the continuance of the American Civil war, and the payment of this bonus. With the close of the war, and the cessation of the  bonus, however, it failed.' In 1885 the State Government offered a bonus, not to the growers, but to the manufacturers of cotton goods. A bonus of £5,000 for the production of the first 5,000 yards of cotton goods was offered, with the result that the. requisite quantity was produced, the bonus was drawn, and the industry at once ceased to exist. Later on, as the outcome of experiments by the Queensland Agricultural College, it was demonstrated that cotton could be profitably grown i'n that State, and Messrs. Kitchen and Sons entered, with considerable success, upon the work of cotton raising. On page 5 of the Memorandum which has been circulated, we find in the Queensland report the statement - </para>

                        <para>Messrs. Kitchen and Sons, of Eagle-street, Brisbane, have established a ginning plant  of  the latest make, and other oil firms are making inquiries into the matter. The Department in 1905 handled the crop for the farmers in a similar manner as that described  for  coffee, and the success of the experiment was the reason for the venture of Messrs. Kitchen and Sons. The manufacture of cotton see,d oil being part of the industry accounts for the interest of the firm mentioned. Australia will consume the output for many years to come. </para>

                        <para>Experiments have proved that cotton can be successfully cultivated in any part of the settled districts of Queensland. The area in 1905 was 171 acres, as against 30 acres in 1904, and about 500 acres are now being grown. The districts in which it. is grown are Moreton, Rockhampton, Port Curtis, the Burnett, .Darling Downs, and Roma, the first-named holding by far the greater area. </para>

Messrs. Kitchen and Sons started in .1894 with 30 acres, and to-day  they  are putting 500 acres under cotton cultivation. It has already been stated that other parts of the continent are suitable for the production of this commodity, and if the industry can be successfully carried on in Queensland, we have only to point out to those desirous of entering it the district suitable for cotton culture, in order to secure its establishment without the assistance of a bounty, especially with a rising market as an extra incentive.

                        <para>Last year about 42 tons of unginned cotton was grown in Queensland and handled by the Government. This year Messrs. Kitchen and Sons have entered into the business of ginning, and will probably deal with the entire crop. The firm is offering the farmers  13d.  per lb. for their unginned material, and is giving the farmers seed free and paying the railage to Bris-' bane, where we have erected ginning machinery, which one day we hope to be able to always keep going. Our offer, including railage, really amounts to 1 3/8d. per lb., and not ijd., and is an improvement on that made by the British Cotton Growers' Association. This year's crop will be about the same as last year's, viz., 42 tons. Next year, however, the firm intends developing the entire business by leasing 100 acres itself and planting cotton seed. This means that the 1907 crop will be at least twice that of 1906. I have already telegraphed to an agent to select suitable land, so that we may go ahead. The acquisition of the 100 acres doubles the acreage under cultivation, and will demonstrate the possibilities of the revived industry. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Daniel</inline> Jones, of the Queensland Agricultural Department, who is rendering us every assistance, believes that on the experience of the last two experimental seasons there will be no difficulty about the labour for picking. The average yield to the farmers last year was  a  clear <inline font-style="italic">£g</inline> per acre. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jones</inline> thinks the crop will pay better than maize and wheat in many districts. I think, of course, that to develop] the industry and to encourage those who have ventured into it to greater efforts a small Federal bonus is necessary. Once the cotton is produced there is no difficulty in disposing of it in Australia. We don't need to send it to England. At present we are sending the seed to Melbourne to be pressed and used in the making of soap. The cotton seed cake is used for cattle. The fibre is rapidly sold in connexion with the flannelette and other industries in Australia and New .Zealand. When we have supplied - as we shall not for many years - our own market there is the great Japanese market at our doors. Japan imported 151,000,000 lbs. of cotton in one very recent half year. </para>

                        <para>During the whole of my trip I found farmers interested in cotton, particularly the wheatgrowers, who are disheartened by the many failures in the wheat crop. The evidence to hand of the very luxuriant manner of growth of both the Sea Island and Upland sorts should determine the question as to the profit of cotton-growing. The soils of the Maranoa region are particularly adapted for cotton by virtue of their light, deep nature. In them the cotton shrub roots deeply, and thus gets fertility and moisture inaccessible to most other plants. The quality of fibre showing is in every respect equal to the high standard of quality characteristic of Queensland cotton. A feature of the cotton crop is its hardihood under drought conditions, thus the inland districts here referred to will suit this crop extremely well. </para>

                    <para class="block">The report goes on to say that there is a very strong probability that cotton may displace wheat in some of those areas to which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jones</inline> refers. If that be the case, it shows that the farmers are already becoming alive to the advantages of cotton growing ; and when they find it to be a more dependable crop, and, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jones,</inline> the more profitable crop, ordinary commercial reasons will at once suggest the idea of its substitution for wheat, especially as it grows in the same soil. The question of a bounty for the production of olives was debated very fully when a similar Bill was before the previous Parliament. It was then shown that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Davenport, the pioneer of the olive industry in Australia, or, at any rate, in South Australia, had, without a bounty, successfully established its cultivation in that State, where, I believe, he carries on a very successful plantation to-day. Reference has already been made to the fact that olives were also grown without a bounty at the Mildura settlement; but I understand that the olive trees there were torn up, for what reason I have not been able to exactly ascertain. I presume, however, that the cultivation of the olives was abandoned because it was found more profitable to cultivate raisins, figs, and other fruits. Here, again, the commercial instinct asserted itself, and the Mildura settlers, like sensible people, turned their attention to the more remunerative productions. The honorable and learned member for Bendigo, I believe, also engaged to some extent in the cultivation of the olive ; and, if my memory serves me rightly, I think that when the honorable and learned member spoke on the previous Bill, he related that he had obtained from Mildura or elsewhere some trees which thrived wonderfully well. But he uprooted the trees after a while simply because he found there was no market for his product. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know much about the technical terms, and I do not give that as an authoritative statement; but during the previous debate it was stated that the olive yields about 2 gallons of oil per cwt., and that the price is something like10s. per gallon. If there is a market, that price seems very fair, and should return a handsome profit, providing the cost of production is not too great. However, the complaint seems to be that there is no market, and if that be so, it is absolute folly to offer a bounty for the production of the olive. And if, on the other hand, it is demonstrably a paying industry already in existence, the payment of a bounty to encourage it is equally illogical and indefensible. Nevertheless, we have the peculiar spectacle of a Minister introducing a Bill proposing to give a bounty for the production of something for which it is alleged there is no market. The item of palm oil is, I am afraid, rather a delicate subject to deal with. The term " palm oil " is capable of a variety of interpretations, and is associated with practices which I trust will never find encouragement in this House. On referring to the report, I find that that aspect of the matter is accentuated by the description of the palm as a "fleshy" fruit; and it is evidently a subject with which we should deal very tenderly, or, better still, pass over altogether. Tobacco has for some time been produced in Australia under the influence of an extremely high protective duty ; and if, under the circumstances high-grade tobacco is not already produced here, we should not obtain better quality by means of a system of bounties. The duty on tobacco is sufficiently high already to offer every inducement for its successful cultivation in its highest possible grade; and if Australian smokers will not use Australian tobacco it is absurd to offer a bounty in view of the failure of the duty. </para>

                            <para>- A bonus is also offered for the production of coffee. Whether we are in favour of bounties or not, as a principle, if bounties are given they should be for the production of commodities which may possibly form the basis of permanently established industries in Australia. But how can coffee comply with such a condition? Brazil at the present time produces all the coffee that the world can consume. The total consumption of coffee throughout the world is something like 915,000 tons, and there are over 1,000,000 tons produced in Brazil alone. </para>

                            <para>- As a matter of fact, some of the plantations in Brazil are being destroyed because the surplus goes to waste. The world's markets are already supplied by Brazil, where coffee has been produced for many years, and yet I suppose the idea underlying these bounty proposals is that in time the Australian producers of the commodity may be able to export. It is desired, not only that this country should be self-contained, meeting its own needs, but that it should have an export as well as a home market. We are, however, asked to give a bounty for the encouragement of a product of which there is already an over supply both in the home market and abroad. Such a ridiculous proposal should be omitted from- the schedule. The report says - </para>

                        <para>The records available of Australian experience in coffee-growing are by no means encouraging. In the year 1903 there were 31S acres under coffee in Queensland, the total yield being 83,632 lbs. Valuing this at gd. per lb. - which is allowed to be a fair average price - the return would not be more than £10 per acre. Considering the labour involved in clearing and preparing the land, in picking and cleaning for market, and bearing in mind the fact that the plantation does not become productive until it is four years old, this return appears totally inadequate. With all these disadvantages, the fact remains that coffee of a good type can be produced over large portions of Northern Australia, and accordingly a bonus of id. per lb. for eight years is recommended. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">In spite of the fact that the industry has proved an absolute failure, it is recommended as a subject for a bounty. To spend the taxpayers' money in this way is to waste it. If honorable members were asked to advance their own money to help such enterprises, their business instincts would lead them to condemn the proposals as unworthy of a moment's consideration. No doubt some .of the items in the schedule are being suggested with a view to the development of the Northern Territory. </para>

                            <para>- Yes ; and as the price of rubber in the world's markets is increasing, it will, no doubt, be largely produced in the Northern Territory without Government assistance, assuming that it can be profitably produced there. The possibility of making an immense profit is always a sufficient inducement to investors to spend money on new industries, but where industries are unprofitable, it is useless to attempt to stimulate them, or to bolster them up by artificial means. I have seen fibres grown in the Northern Territory. </para>

                            <para>- That, and others, are being grown in the Palmerston Botanic Gardens. It must be remembered, however, that these gardens have been under cultivation for something like twenty-five years, in accordance with the most scientific methods, and that constant care and attention has been given to the plants there, and the fact that certain things have thriven in those gardens on a small scale is not a guarantee that they will do equally well if grown on a large scale outside, and under less favorable auspices as to supervision and preparation of soil. The true test of the advisability of entering upon any line of production is the demand for the thing produced. Whenever there is a demand, there will be a supply to meet it, if the necessary production is likely to prove profitable. But it is useless to oppose proposals for the encouragement of new industries if we cannot offer an alternative scheme. The question is, how can we best promote primary production ? </para>

                            <para>- At the proper time I shall give my views on land taxation ; I cannot do so now without infringing the Standing Orders. To encourage primary production, we must try to bring about closer settlement, by putting an end to the monopolization of huge tracts of country which are not now being used to the best advantage. As the States have control of the public lands of Australia, it is difficult for the Federal Parliament to deal with the abuse of land monopoly, although that has for many years past been the one real obstacle to the increase of population, and the settlement of our rural districts. No bounty system will ever do half as much for tie country as a system of land reform. I do not know of any instance in which an industry has been established and persons permanently settled on the land by the bounty system. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Riverina could not have given a worse illustration. The money paid by the Victorian Government for the encouragement of the butter industry went, not into the pockets of the farmers, but into the hands of persons for whom it was never intended. I agree with the suggestions which have been made for the establishment of a National Bureau of Agriculture, and, as last year I spoke on the subject at length, I shall to-night only summarize the main points of my previous speech. If the Commonwealth worked in conjunction with the States authorities in supplying settlers with the best expert information as to the nature, character, and possibilities of soils, their chemistry, the best crops to grow, the conditions most favorable to success, and dealt with all the other points of interest to agriculturists, a great deal would be done for the assistance of primary industries. In New South Wales the State has established institutions like the Hawkesbury Agricultural College and a number of experimental farms, while in Victoria we have the Dookie College, in South Australia the Roseworthy College, and in Queensland the Gatton College, all of them doing useful work. If the Commonwealth spent money in assisting this work, its efforts would be more advantageous to the farmers than would the payment" of haphazard bounties. The experiment of establishing agricultural colleges originated in Germany about 1851, at a place called Moeckern, and gradually extended, until now there are in the country seventy agricultural colleges or bureaux for the purpose of giving technical instruction in agricultural processes. </para>

                            <para>- That must be a very recent development. I have never heard of it, and cannot understand why bonuses should be needed after over half-a-century, of effort such as I describe. Similar experimental colleges and stations were instituted in America in 1875. In 1886 there were twelve of these institutions, and now there are over sixty, with a staff of upwards of 700 expert teachers. The result of the dissemination of agricultural knowledge which has taken place is that dry districts, formerly regarded as worthless, some of them having not more than twelve inches of rain in . a year, are now producing splendid crops. Among the matters covered by these experimental stations are the perfecting of machinery and implements, the composition of soils, the most suitable fertilisers to use in connexion with various soils, the best methods of cultivation to adopt, irrigation, drainage, the feeding of stock, with special reference to digestion, and the introduction of drought-resisting seeds and plants. Generally, all questions pertaining to the advancement of agriculture and stock-raising are dealt with by these, colleges. In the Washington bureau, I believe hundreds of applications for information are daily received from settlers, and in some cases it is found expedient to send experts to assist the farmers in the practical work of production. These are the lines generally upon which I would prefer to see public money expended if it is thought, necessary to assist rural production. But. I have always been opposed to the granting of bounties. History teaches me that although their payment in the first instance is usually limited to a certain period, that period is almost invariably extended. The plea is set up that if the bounty be withdrawn the industry which it is intended to foster will be ruined. Thus a demand is made for an extension of the term, and usually a sympathetic Legislature accedes to it. Then, when the period of extension has expired and the bounty is ultimately, after further extensions, withdrawn, a protective duty is usually substituted for it, so that as a matter of fact the ill-effect of the bounty does not actually cease with its withdrawal. I think I have made it perfectly clear that I am opposed to the principle of bounties generally, and to the bounties proposed by this Bill in particular. Consequently, the Government cannot expect me to afford the measure any support. Some honorable members opposite have twitted members sitting upon this side of the House, who have expressed themselves in favour of the payment of bounties under certain conditions, with advocating Socialism. </para>

                            <para>- I wish to point out that some of the. highest socialistic authorities in the world absolutely deny that any State assistance of that, sort can be associated with Socialism. They describe as bogus Socialists people who claim State aid to foster private enterprise. I propose to read, one short extract in support of my statement. The leader of the Labour Party says the Socialism of the party is of the Fabian type. I will, therefore, quote from a Fabian authority. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hubert</inline> Bland says - </para>

                    <para>State control does not imply Socialism - at least in any modern meaning of the term. It is not so much to the thing the State does, as to the end for which it does it that we must look before we can decide whether it is a Socialist State or not. Socialism is the common holding of the means of production and exchange, and the holding of them for the equal benefit of all. In view of the tone now being adopted by some of us, I cannot too strongly insist upon the importance of this distinction ; for the losing sight of it by friends, and its intentional obscuration by enemies, constitute a big and immediate danger. . . . Yet this is the sort of sham Socialism which it is as certain as death will be doled out by the popular party in the hope that mere State action will be mistaken for really Socialistic legislation. </para>
                    <para class="block">Here, then, is one of the! high priests of Socialism who absolutely repudiates the suspicion that anything in the nature of the granting of bounties can be even remotely associated with Socialism. This taunt having been made by several honorable members opposite during the course of the debate, I thought it advisable before resuming my seat to quote one of their own authorities, with a view to showing how absurd is the contention which has been set up. I intend to vote against the second reading of the Bill. </para>

                        <para>.- The honorable member for Lang speaks very frequently in this House, and often at considerable length. The cardinal principle upon which his remarks are based is the principle of "do nothing." The great burden of his song is that every form of State enterprise is wrong, and that every industry can best be encouraged by being left severely alone. He has affirmed that those industries which are suitable to Australia will, in the very nature of things, become established here, and that there is not a single instance on record of an industry having, been successfully established in this Continent by means of a bounty. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know whether the honorable member limited his remark even to Australia - I am not quite sure that he did. But as soon as the honorable member for Riverina interjected that the butter industry in Victoria had been established as -the result of the payment of the butter' bonus, the honorable member for Lang shifted his ground, and declared that the butter bonus had found its way, not into the pockets of the producers, but into those of the middlemen. That statement, I would point out, was no answer to the interjection of the honorable member for Riverina. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable member asks me whether the payment of the bonus actually caused the industry to be established, I say "no." I recollect that the first speech which I delivered in any Legislature was made upon the Butter Bonus Bill in the South Australian Parliament. I supported that measure upon the ground that it would give a fillip to an industry which had received very little attention, that the effect of offering that industry a little encouragement would be a great increase in the production of butter and the maintenance of steady prices all the year round, which would be a decided benefit to the producers. Certainly the bonus had that effect, though I admit that in South Australia it did not reach the persons whom it was intended to benefit - indeed, it has been alleged that the bonus was actually paid upon cream which was sent from Victoria. But the fact remains that up to the period when the bonus was granted, that State had exported no butter. From that time onward, however, it has exported that commodity, and the industry has become very successful. </para>

                            <para>- It has been urged by one honorable member that the Renmark and Mildura settlements afford instances of the successful establishment of industries by means of State aid. Although no bounty was distributed in connexion with the establishment of those settlements, valuable consideration was certainly given to the settlers. In the first instance the land at Renmark, and probably at Mildura, was given to Chaffey Brothers, and subsequently considerable advances on remarkably easy terms were made in respect of the settlements. Although we are told by croakers of the type of the honorable member for Lang, that it is useless to attempt to "bolster" up an industry in this way, the result of the State aid given to both the Renmark and the Mildura settlements has been in the highest degree satisfactory. The objections taken by the honorable member for Lang to the granting of bounties were raised in the States Parliaments with reference to the granting of State aid to the Mildura and Renmark settlements, but fortunately the Government of the day, for the most part, continued to assist the settlers, with the result that we have -there to-day a remarkably successful industry, affording an object-lesson o'f what can be done with land which, without such assistance, would probably remain untouched for many years. Another instance of the satisfactory results attending what the honorable member has described as " State coddling " is afforded by the position which the Export Department of South Australia occupies to-day. The work of that Department has been so frequently described .in this House, that it is unnecessary for me to enter into detail. I might explain, however, that its establishment was due to the fact that private enterprise refused to enter the field, which lay open to it. The Government offered to guarantee two loans of £10,000 each- </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member may have a more accurate recollection of the facts than I possess. I know, however, that the State Government pro- . posed to guarantee two loans to enable private enterprise to establish meat works, one near Mount Gambier, and the other in the Northern Territory. Notwithstanding this offer, however, no one was found prepared to undertake the work. The Government had, therefore, to step in, with the result that we have in South Australia to-day probably the most successful State Export Department in the world. Having embarked upon this undertaking, the Government did not subsequently hand it over to private enterprise; and it has now no competitors in the State. The outcome of the establishment of the Department has been the creation of a number of minor industries, and a satisfactory supervision of our export trade. All this has been the result of that " State coddling" which the honorable member for Lang so strongly deprecates. It has been suggested, as an alternative proposal to the Bill now under consideration, that it would be much better to establish a Federal Department of. Agriculture. I fail to see how that can be regarded as an alternative scheme. </para>

                            <para>- Both statements may be said to be correct. The honorable and learned member for Bendigo, the honorable member for Capricornia, and the honorable member for Lang have all said that it would be better to establish a Federal Department of Agriculture than to agree to the granting of these bounties. Whilst such a Department would serve a useful purpose,, since it would carry out certain work which the States Departments do not undertake, and might also avoid overlapping, it could do nothing for many years hence in the way of establishing any of these industries. In the first place, many years would be occupied in its organization. Reference has been made to the great work accomplished by the Agricultural Bureau of the United States of America. That, however, is the growth of half a century, and we could not hope within a short period to secure anything like the degree of success that has been attained by it. The honorable member for Wimmera said that he was in favour of such a department, but that we should still leave to the States the experimental work and the dissemination of technical knowledge. If we excluded from the scope of a Federal Department of Agriculture the conducting of experiments and the dissemination of information of value to agriculturists, we should leave practically nothing for its attention, but the collection of agricultural statistics. </para>

                            <para>- I think the suggestion made by the honorable member for Wimmera was that the statistical information collected by the Federal Department could best be distributed by the States. If that course were adopted, the Federal Department would simply collect statistics nf interest to the pastoral and agricultural community, and hand them over, to the States Departments in order that the information so obtained might be disseminated. But how many new industries would be  established  in Australia as the result of the collection of information by such a Department ? </para>

                            <para>- That would be a&gt; very difficult work to undertake. If I were a Federal officer, I should not care to interfere, except in a very tentative way, with the export trade of the States. We could: regulate the trade successfully only by acting in conjunction with the States. If the honorable member, as the agricultural expert of the Commonwealth, were to attempt to interfere with the export trade of South Australia, which is controlled by the Government, we should have the State in arms. </para>

The cry that it is necessary to secure uniformity in connexion with our export trade - that a uniform system should be adopted by all the States - is somewhat overdone. </para>

                            <para>- That is a possibility of which I had not thought, and the honorable member's interjection reminds me that hidden dangers constantly beset us. It is to be regretted that honorable members should advocate the establishment of a Federal Bureau of Agriculture as an alternative to the passing of this Bill. The principle of the Bill may be wrong, but the mere fact that a Federal Department of Agriculture might be of some service does not make it so. A very excellent report from the Queensland Department of Agriculture appears as an addendum to the report of the Conference, and forms most interesting reading. The gentlemen who attended the Conference summarize in their report the information at their dis* posal, but do not give us any details. The Queensland report, on the other hand, supplies much useful information, and I should be glad if we had similar data from the other 'States. On turning to the schedule, one is surprised to find that not only in Queensland, but in South Australia, a great many attempts have been made to conduct on a commercial scale some of the industries covered by this Bill. We find, for instance, that flax was successfully grown many years ago in the neighbourhood of Mount Gambier, and that its production was dropped only because of the difficulties associated with the retting. The unpleasant odour caused by the process spoilt the whole business, but now that chemicals are employed I should say there is no reason why flax should not be successfully grown, at any rate, in the districts where the industry was profitably carried on previously, and where, with improved conditions and appliances, it might expand greatly. The bounty proposed is only some  £40,000  in the aggregate, and that would not prove any great burden on the people of the Commonwealth, while the effect might be to encourage a large number to add another to the industries of Australia. When the butter bonus was withdrawn in Victoria there was no stoppage of the industry. </para>

Had any one State in Australia established the industry successfully before South Australia or Victoria did, I do not think that there would have been any suggestion of a bonus, because the market would have been exploited, and the organization of the trade perfected. It is easy to follow where others have trodden ; the difficulty is to strike out a new track. There was a more or less paying mohair industry in South Australia a great many 3'ears ago. One of the first flocks of Angora goats was brought to Australia by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Price</inline> Maurice, a pastoralist, and placed on the Mount Lofty hills. From that station, a large number of goats were distributed, and some of them were sent by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kempe</inline> to his Peake Station, not very far from Oodnadatta. Owing to the death of one of his partners, who took a great interest in the industry, that magnificent flock was dispersed, some of the goats being sent to South Africa and some to New South Wales. It is possibly worth while to try the effect of a small bonus in order to induce pastoralists to once more take up this industry. A very large portion of the arid districts of Australia are better suited for the production of mohair than any other commodity - better suited for goats than any other stock. The advantage to Australia of settling our unoccupied country is so patent that, if the expenditure of £3,000 in the form of a bonus would have any such effect as I have indicated, it would be worth while providing the money many times over; and I think we should all be pleased to take part in the establishment of such an industry. As to olives, everybody knows that the olive oil industry is an Australian industry. </para>

                            <para>- The difficulty of those engaged in this industry is that they have to compete against adulterated oils, and oils produced much more cheaply. Pure olive oil is said to be difficult to obtain in the old country ; and the Export Department of South Australia had constant reports from Europe to the effect that the people there preferred, from long use, the adulterated article- that the pure olive oil from South Australia had not so good a market as adulterated oil, owing to the capricious taste of the people. It is true that this industry has been established in South Australia without a bounty, and I hope it will continue to expand whether a bounty be granted or not. But it is an industry that is specially suited to a great part of the Commonwealth ; and if the effect of the very small bounty proposed were to encourage a great deal more planting, production would expand, and the wealth and the prosperity of the people would be increased. Quite lately, the Adelaide <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> made a proposal to Messrs. Cleland and Company, who manufacture for <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Davenport, and are the principal manufacturers of olive oil in South Australia, that they should distribute truncheons, from which the olive plant is (propagated, free. That has been done; and I saw. only last week that when the new trees are in full bearing, the present production in South Australia will be almost doubled. It will be seen, therefore, that something is being done without a bounty in that State. Then I think something should be done to make an attempt to encourage the production of rice. In the Northern Territory there is an immense area of valuable river flats, which seems to be specially designed for growing this commodity. There are no lands in the Commonwealth which could be more cheaply irrigated than the flats along the Adelaide River, which is one of the finest streams of the Commonwealth ; and a bounty would be the means of proving whether or not those lands could be utilized for the production of rice. The next item I desire to refer to is dates, which I mention because this fruit is referred to in the report as being produced in Queensland. I have' spoken to one or two honorable members, who inform me that they had no notion that dates were produced anywhere else but in the northern State. As a matter of fact, the first date plantation in Australia was started by the South Australian Government at Hergott; and only a few weeks ago I had some very good fruit from there. Dates are also most successfully grown by the South Australian Government at Lake Harry, and there are several other plantations in that State. This shows that there are industries whereby great wealth may be won from the arid northern districts. At the present time most of the dates consumed in the Commonwealth are imported, but if we could meet our own demands, we should be so much the better off, and the probability is that a bounty such as that proposed will induce private individuals to commence growing dates for the market. So far they have been profitably grown under Government control. A date crop increases as the palm .gets on in years, and the palms are very long lived. </para>

We are all anxious, no matter where we sit, to establish new industries, and thus increase our population, particularly in our northern districts. Most of the bounties are for the encouragement of tropical industries, and our tropical districts are the most difficult to develop, chiefly for climatic reasons. But if by the giving of bounties we can increase settlement there, even to a small extent, it will be worth, doing. I hope, therefore, that honorable members will not throw the Bill aside if they see any possibility of encouraging settlement by its means. The development of our tropical areas is essential to our future well-being, and I am prepared to go a great way to endeavour to induce settlement there. It is mainly with that object in view that I shall vote for the second reading, though I do not pledge myself to support the measure in all its details. ' </para>

While I am anxious to see industries established, I am not anxious to establish them' at the public expense. The honorable member dealt with the items in the schedule one by one ; but in every case in which he emphasized the need for a bounty it was with regard to an industry  which he said has already been successfully established. Thus he approved the giving of bounties for the production of olives, dates, and dried fruits. </para>

                            <para>- He also dwelt on the need for doing all that we can to induce settlement in the northern parts of Australia. I do not see any necessity for paying bounties for the encouragement of already established industries. This is the third Bounty Bill that has been before the Commonwealth Parliament. The original proposal was to give a bounty for the encouragement of the iron industry, but last Parliament a Bill similar to this was introduced. The Government propose that £530,000 shall be expended in trying to establish certain exotic industries, and in this connexion I have a very pertinent question to put to the Attorney-General. Would he, as a capitalist, invest money in the rice industry, which is one of those which the Government propose to encourage? The conclusion I draw from his silence is that he would not. The honorable member for_ Laanecoorie has told the House that those who are opposed to the granting of bounties must be rank Conservatives. If carefulness of the public funds is to be the mark of a Conservative, I hope that I shall always be one, whereas, if the squandering of revenue is to be the mark of the Radical, I hope that I shall never be a Radical. Some honorable members have objected to the Bill on the ground that its proposals should be linked with proposals for Tariff reform, and others on the ground that its introduction should have been preceded by a statement of the financial position. Neither ground of objection has much weight with me, because I think that it is entirely a matter for the Government to say whether they will or will not link their bounty proposals with their Tariff proposals, while the fact that the Treasurer had an overflowing Treasury would be no good reason for the payment of bounties. Moreover, Ministers cannot hope to remain in office during the fifteen years for which the proposed bounties are to continue, and, therefore, I have no real interest in the financial aspect of the matter. No one can dream that they will be in power fifteen years hence, that, to use the language of the Attorney-General, their two years' occupancy of office is the little rivulet which will swell to the mighty stream of a fifteen years' tenure. Election reminiscences are seldom palatable, but it is occasionally well to listen to the election echoes. </para>

                            <para>- At the last elections the Opposition candidates made a good deal of noise about anti-Socialism, but the Labour candidates made more noise about Socialism. In my opinion, protection and the bounty system are twin sisters, and I cannot understand the action of free-traders in supporting the granting of bounties by expressing socialistic views. To-night a member of the Opposition quoted what he called a socialistic work to prove that the bounty system is not socialistic. The writer of the work, however, was a Fabian Socialist, and it is well known that to-day the real Socialists do not recognise a Fabian. </para>

                            <para>- Then he is not a real Socialist. The social democrats of Great Britain look askance at a Fabian, much as a protectionist looks at a freetrader. The honorable member for Lang says that the granting of bounties is not a socialistic step, but, in my opinion, it is. If bounties are to be given for the encouragement of fifteen or sixteen industries, why should they not be given for the encouragement of forty, or of an indefinite number? Moreover, if the State is to encourage industries by a grant of £530,000, will it not be justified in controlling the expenditure of its money? If the State tries to build up an industry by the expenditure of money, why should it not take full control of that industry? Yet certain honorable members who are declared anti-Socialists say that they are prepared to vote for State aid to industries - though I may have a wrong idea as to what constitutes an anti-Socialist. I consider that protection is the twin sister of Socialism, and that this bounty system is its handmaiden. It is proposed that these bounties shall be granted for various periods covering from five to fifteen years. In the first  few years an expenditure of £75,000 annually is contemplated. It will be recollected that for two years in this House, with the assistance of the Labour Party, I fought strenuously against the proposal of a Government to grant a substantial bonus to  the iron industry. That proposal was defeated, notwithstanding that if any justification exists for the payment of a bonus it is unquestionably in connexion with the iron and ship-building industries. </para>

                            <para>- I may inform the honorable member who interjects that  1  am not advocating the claims of the iron industry from any parochial motive. At the last election the employe's in that industry allied themselves with the Labour Party, and endeavoured to secure my defeat. But  1  fought them, and triumphed. I ask the members of that party whether they are prepared to vote against the second reading of this Bill, and to request the Government to bring forward a fresh' measure embodying a proposal for the payment of a bonus to the iron industry. Not a single industry connected with the production of the articles enumerated in the schedule to this Bill can be successfully established without the employment of black labour. Take the cultivation of rice as an example. In Victoria the product from rice is starch. Only recently the fact was disclosed that those employed in the starch industry in Victoria were working for starvation wages. </para>

Under this Bill the Government propose to offer a bounty °f £*&gt;°°° per annum to encourage the cultivation of rice. Am I to understand that a flourishing industry can be reared upon such slender encouragement ? Then I ask : "What guarantee have we that, at the expiration of fifteen years the bounty system will cease ?" I venture to say that at the end of that period these hot-house plants will require further fuel from the Commonwealth Treasury. Are we to commit ourselves to the policy of granting bounties for an indefinite period, or are we merely to waste £530,000 during fifteen years, and then allow these industries to perish? </para>

                            <para>- I am. Some honorable members have urged that in the tenders for the new mail contract provision should be made for cold storage accommodation. Others are prepared to foster the producing interests by means of the payment of a bounty upon agricultural productions. Why, then, should I not stand up for the artisans in my own electorate? The honorable member for Boothby has admitted that the middleman derived the chief benefit from the operation of the bounty system. The only thing which he could say in support of it was that in South Australia an industry remained. This is a case of oiling the olive - an industry in which large fortunes have been made. Having opposed the application of the bounty system to a substantial industry like that of iron, I do not feel disposed to support this Bill. If bounties are a good thing, why not extend them to the iron and ship-building industries? The ship-building trade, by reason of our protective Tariff, is to-day suffering more than is any other branch of industry. In Committee, I shall move that the more substantial sums specified in this Bill shall be appropriated for these particular industries. The echoes of the last election have not yet died away, and I am decidedly of opinion that the bounty system constitutes one step in the direction of Socialism. If we are to introduce that system, why not go a step further and establish State control of industries ? To my mind, there is only a difference of complexion between certain honorable members in this House. Some have been a little longer in the sun, and these call themselves Socialists, whilst others who have been sitting under the olive trees, and who are not quite so brown, call themselves anti-Socialists. I think that the public have a right to be considered in this matter. There are one or two industries in Australia, such as the fisheries industry, the establishment of which those who believe in the bounty system might advocate with some degree of reason. The big capitalists of the world are very keen in discovering good investments, and if any of the enterprises which the Government propose to encourage by this Bill were likely: to prove remunerative, they would have invested in them long ago. </para>

                            <para>- It has been said that the honorable member is a Socialist, but I do not think that he is a great sinner in that respect. The only difference between him and some other honorable members is that they wear differently cut coats and different classes of boots. One may wear boots made of patent leather, and another boots which are made of a different material. But, to my mind, many honorable members who are not suspected of such a tendency are all treading the socialistic path. I maintain that there is nobody in Australia who is dying to become a rice-planter. There is not a member of the Labour Party who would " burst his boiler " to become even a cotton-grower. Nor is anybody consumed with a desire co deal with flax or fibres. Yet we are told that these industries must be established. The honorable member for Echuca, who is' a new member of this House, boldly criticised many of the proposals in this Bill, and dealt with the history of the application of the bonus system to Victorian industries. During the Gillies boom a sum of  £230,000  was paid by way of bonuses to establish' various industries in Victoria, and to-day there is nothing to show for that expenditure. The honorable member for Indi pointed out that a large sum was expended bv the Victorian Government in an effort to promote vine culture, but that to-day the industry was practically at a stand-still. The Gillies boom was a silly boom, and if this Bill be carried, we shall probably have the same tale to tell when we have completed the expenditure of the  £500,000  proposed to be distributed under it. I find myself in a somewhat awkward position. Some of the members of the Opposition are opposed to the whole principle of the Bill, while others - for the most part representatives of Victoria - declare that no objection would be taken if the Tariff resolutions1 were first submitted. How can one who has always opposed the bounty system: - who. has fought against its application to the iron industry, the ship-building trade, and deep sea fisheries, in connexion with, which it might meet with some success - vote for a Bill such as this ? I do not know whether some honorable members on this side of the House have suddenly become protectionists. At the last election, I and other members of my party played on " Reed "' instruments. In the musical world it is well known that such instruments produce the most pleasing sounds. That on which I played was not the big clarionet of the prominent politician, but the smaller instrument of a more humble member of the band. I have not forgotten the tune which I played; I am repeating it to-night. The only ground on which I fought the Labour Party was its advocacy of Socialism. So far as other political questions were concerned, I found' myself very much iti sympathy with them; but I was opposed to them on the ground*, that they were seeking to nationalize certain industries. To-day, however, I find that some of those who played with me in the " Reed " band are going to take the very step against which they protested so strongly at the last general election. Some of the Victorian members of the party are among this number. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member is so well satisfied with himself that one could never expect him to commit political suicide, or do anything that was worth remembering. I do not wish, however, to be too severe on him, because we have a good deal in common, and there is no more popular man in the House this week than is the honorable member. When an- honorable member remembers his pledges to his constituents he has nothing to fear. I cannot see my way clear to vote for the granting of bounties in respect of industries, some of which, as the honorable member for Boothby has pointed out, are already successfully established. Other industries covered by this Bill are such that white labour could not profitably be employed in them. Why should I vote for. the building up of an industry in which alien labour must be employed, while there are more substantial industries to which the system might be more satisfactorily applied? Australia to-day is enjoying a season of prosperity. The revenue of the Commonwealth is buoyant ; but a prudent politician will always have regard <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> the possibility of lean as well as fat years. We do not know what may happen in the course of the next few years. There are other measures to be dealt with which will involve very considerable expenditure, and in connexion with which the sum of  £500,000,  proposed to be expended under this Bill might be more profitably employed. I believe in a Federal system of old-age pensions, and have a right to ask myself in considering these proposals whether the Government or its successors will have the funds necessary to carry out that system. Politicians and others who took part in the Federal Convention declare that the great rock which the ship of Federation has to fear is the rock of finance, and I cannot understand why the Government should propose, in this unnecessary way, to plunge into an expenditure of  £500,000.  The Minister of Trade and Customs and the Postmaster-General had something sub.stantial to fight for when they invited the House to agree to the Manufactures Encouragement Bill, which provided for the payment of bounties for the establishment of the iron industry. I and my leader, however, bitterly opposed that measure. But for the action of the Opposition those honorable gentlemen would have had the honour - and I dare say that they would have regarded it as an honour - of placing on the statute-book of the Commonwealth a Bill providing for the payment of bounties to establish an industry which, according to the statements they placed before us, would give employment to thousands. </para>

                            <para>- According to the honorable gentleman's statements it would. Since I thought it necessary to vote against that measure, why should I vote for that now under consideration? If it were a question of bounty or no bounty I should cry " both hands up for the iron industry, and that of shipbuilding, which is so nearly associated with it." The honorable member for Lang quoted the views of a Fabian Socialist in support of the argument that this is not a socialistic proposal. My slight reading has taught me, however, that a Fabian Socialist is hardly a Socialist in the true sense of the word. I certainly think that protection is half way on the road to Socialism. I can understand a protectionist, who has declared from time to time that he is in favour of more and more protection, being regarded as a Socialist, but I cannot understand a freetrader favouring the bounty system, which is merely an attempt to bring in Socialism by a side wind. </para>

If one honorable member is prepared to favour a Bounties Bill because of its application to industries in his electorate, why should I not vote for a bounty that would affect industries in my constituency? The honorable member for Boothby said that a Federal Bureau of Agriculture would be useless. </para>

There is no possibility of their being successfully established here. If they could be, would not the far North have been invaded long ago by capitalists? We have had before us a report showing that enormous profits can be secured from the production of rubber. </para>

                            <para>- The prospective profits are almost sufficient to induce bloated capitalists like the honorable member for Barrier and myself to embark on the enterprise. If the industry were established, however, the public would receive no part of the profits derived from it. I do not think any further facts or arguments will alter the views of honorable members.  A political Ishmaelite is one who fights for his own hand, and if I find honorable members advocating the claims of producers in their electorates, it may he taken for granted that the member for Dalley, who does not, as the members of the Labour Party insinuated, fight in his own personal interests, will, on every occasion, see that the industries in which his constituents are engaged are not neglected. That, of course, is a most miserable position to have to take up, but I find honorable member after honorable member on both sides of the House showing, by their speeches that, when any proposed legislation suits their own constituents, they say good-bye to principles, and I should be a traitor to my trust if I did not look after the interests of those who sent me here. If this Bill be passed there will not be a stronger advocate for a bonus on the production of iron than the member who is now addressing the House. </para>

                        <para>.- On behalf of the free-traders of the Labour Party I give the statement just read by the honorable member for Wentworth a direct denial.' If we desire any information we have only to go to the Court records in order to get enough to convict and condemn forty Robert Harpers. Only a few days ago a circular of great length was presented to the employes of the firm in question, and they were requested to say that the statements in a monthly magazine, and in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> and Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> we're absolutely untrue; but nobody would sign that circular, with the exception of three or four of the foremen. If that is the information which it is said Members of Parliament were after, I do not know but that the information is about correct. </para>

                        <para>.- Earlier in the day I asked the Acting Prime Minister whether his attention had been called to a letter written by the  president  of the Immigration League of New South Wales to the secretary of a similar association in Victoria, in which the former advised the latter to misrepresent . the position in Australia in reference to land settlement. I desire to know whether inquiries will be made, and if it be true that such a letter was sent, whether the Government will stop the subsidy of ,£150 which is paid to those associations ? </para>

                            <para>- Then no further sum ought to be paid to them. If money is given by the Commonwealth Government for the purpose of advertising Australia in the old country, and that money is spent by the Immigration League, which misrepresents the position and brings immigrants out under a misapprehension of the conditions which prevail here, the Government are partially responsible for that misrepresentation. Under the circumstances the Government ought to investigate the matter, and if what I have said proves to be correct, any further subsidy ought to be withheld, if the subsidy already paid cannot be recalled. If we are going to pay money for the advertising of Australia to societies like these Immigration Leagues the Government must take the responsibility for what is published by them. It must be responsible for allowing public funds to go into the hands of men who are not careful about their statements, and who, for the sake of gaining notoriety and promoting personal ambitions, are prepared to adopt unscrupulous methods. I trust the Acting Prime Minister will invite the Cabinet to consider the advisableness of repudiating the statements which have been quoted. </para>

                            <para>- I should say that when money is to be applied for such a purpose Parliament should be informed. We want fro see immigration to this country so long as the immigrants can be absorbed. I believe we can absorb many at the present time, at any rate in South Australia. But before they come out I want them to be informed about the conditions prevailing in this country, and shall strongly object to money being spent on immigrants who are brought out under false pretences. That has been done in the past. I know of numbers of families in South Australia who suffered severely through being brought out under misrepresentations, and who, when an appeal was made to the Court, were informed that there was  nothing for them to do but to stand by the agreements made. It appears to me that the Immigration League, to which reference has been made, is doing anything but the satisfactory work that is desired. </para>

                        <para>.- I asked my question with regard to this matter in consequence of advertisements which have been circulated in the United Kingdom with reference to immigration to Australia. I contend that inasmuch as the Government has subsidized the league, it is responsible for these advertisements. When Parliament voted money for immigration purposes it had no idea that anything of that kind would be done. When money is voted by Parliament for such a purpose it ought not to be handed over to irresponsible people to be spent, but the expenditure should be under the control of the Commonwealth Government. Whether it is a wise thing to spend money in bringing out immigrants is a matter for the Parliament to decide, but I strongly object to the way in which this money has been applied. </para>

                            <para>- I think there was a stipulation. It is not a wise thing to hand over public money to such societies to do as they like with. But, of course, it was never anticipated that anything like what has been complained about would be done. No one advocates the advertising of Australia more strongly than I do. but I think it ought to be done by the Commonwealth Government. </para>
