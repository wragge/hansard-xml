                            <para>It appears that in three cases advantage has been taken of the regulation referred to. They were officers whose promotion was approved by the Governor-General on the recommendation of General Hutton, when General Officer Commanding. The difficulty I find in dealing with the matter is that the distinguished services in most cases occurred some years ago, and it was presumed at the time that due recognition was given by the Imperial authorities. </para>

                    <para>In 1902 the Government of the day decided that the status and rank gained by officers on active service should only be regarded as honorary rank, so that to obtain substantive rank officers would have to pass the prescribed examinations as required by the Defence Act. It might justifiably have been urged that officers should have been permitted to retain the rank obtained on active service without being required to pass a further examination. This, however, was not done, and' it is especially difficult to make any alteration now, as the procedure adopted in 1902 has been followed since. Many officers have submitted themselves to examination, and obtained the promotion in the ordinary way, <inline font-style="italic">i.e.,</inline> by examination, while others have not. </para>
                    <para>The matter will be further inquired into. </para>

I agree with the honorable member for Parramatta that some recognition of service should be made, but what was done happened some years ago, and I find it very difficult to arrive at a reasonable solution of the difficulty. </para>

                            <para>.-I would point out that, although the making of articles of apparel and attire such as come within the scope of item 106, is an industry which employs a large number of persons, only two witnesses connected with it came before the Tariff Commission, neither in a representative capacity. They were both Victorian manufacturers, one being a maker of mantles and costumes, and the other a maker of ready-made suits for boys and men, and they use materials supplied by the wholesale houses. The fact that there is a large number of manufacturers in this industry, and that only two of them came before the Commission to complain of the old Tariff, cannot be disregarded by the Committee. The Treasurer ought to give us an explanation of the Government proposals. The highest rate of duty that was asked for by any one was only 40 per cent. upon importations generally, but the Treasurer proposes to put a duty of 45 per cent. on general importations, and of 40 per cent. on importations from the United Kingdom. It was alleged that the importations of the class of goods which come within the scope of the item have been increasing, but statistics do not bear out that statement. As a matter of fact, comparing 1906 with 1 90 1, there has been a considerable reduction in the oversea importations, and a large increase in the number of hands employed in the industry. In Victoria, in 1900, the number of hands employed was 5,601;in 1901, 5,456; in 1902, 5,596; in 1903, 5,490; in1904, 5,845 ; and in 1905 - the last year for which figures are available - 6,113. These figures do not show that the industry is waning, but rather that it is growing. One of the reasons why some of the Victorian manufacturers have felt dissatisfied is that the inter-State transfers have increased. In 1890, New South Wales sent to the other States only £2,607 worth of apparel, while in. 1904 - the last year for which statistics were available to the Tariff Commission - she sent £83,684 worth, part of which came to Victoria. Of course, at the same time, Victoria has been increasing her transfers to the other States. In 1899,. those transfers were worth £119,875, and in 1904 they had increased to £382,000 worth. I hope that the Treasurer will be able to furnish us with the latest statistics with regard to inter-State transfers. </para>

                                <para>- If it can be shown that the transfers from Victoria to the other States have increased, the reasonable deduction will be that the Victorian industry, instead of waning, is flourishing and prosperous. At first sight it would appear that there was a decrease in the number of hands employed in the industry in 1 901 as compared with 1900, but the report of the Chief Inspector of Factories of Victoria shows that in 1901 the underclothing trade was separated from the clothing trade in the official returns, so that there was really a large expansion of the industry. It is to be regretted that a mistake, which was made in respect of this change, in connexion with the examination of one of the witnesses before the Tariff Commission should have been quoted by the  Chairman  in support of the assertion that the industry in Victoria is waning. I would further point out that the high duties which prevailed under the Victorian Tariff did not result in additional employment. In 1891, 1892, and 1893, when high duties prevailed in Victoria, the number of hands employed was less than the number engaged in the industry under the comparatively low duties of the first Federal Tariff. In 1890, when there was a duty of 44 per cent, in operation, 1,417 males and 4,7°° females, or a total of 6,117 operatives were employed in the clothing trade in Victoria. In 189  l,  with the same rate of duty prevailing, there were only 1,150 males and 3,209 females, or a total' of 4.359 employed. In 1892, with a duty of 55 per cent, in operation, there were 987 males and 3,581 females, or a total of 4,568 operatives, so that under the higher duty there was a very serious decrease in the number of male operatives employed in the industry. In other words, it would appear that the higher the duty the smaller the number of males employed. In 1893, with a duty of 55 per cent, still in operation in Victoria, there were 716 males and 3,523 females, or a total of 4&gt;239 operatives. </para>

                                <para>- But what about the* returns for 1890? In 1892 and 1893 there was a duty of 55 per cent, in operation,, and prior to 1892 there was a duty of 44 per cent. I admit that the collapse of the boom was largely responsible for the falling off of employment in these industries, but it led to the development of the dairying industry, which has to a very large extent brought back that prosperity which we hope Victoria will long enjoy. </para>

                                <para>- The figures I have quoted relate to employment in the clothing industry. I now propose to give statistics as to the number of hands employed in other industries to which this item relates. In the corset-making trade in Victoria, in 1900, 42 females were employed, whilst in 1906 there were 34 females employed. In the making of dresses, mantles, millinery, and ladies' underclothing, there were 88 males and 6,668 females employed in 1900, whilst in 1906 there were 132 males and 10,725 females employed. In the hosiery trade there were 35 males and 15 females employed in 1900, whilst in 1906, there were 29 males and 393 females in the industry. In the shirt-making industry in 1900, there were 60 males and 883 females as against 70 males and 1.255 females in 1 906:. whilst in the making of ties and cravats there were 5 males and 116 females employed in 1900. as against 1.1 males and 228 females in 1906. The total number of operatives engaged in 1900 in the several industries to which this item relates was I3)5I3 as against 19,129 in 1906, or an increase of 5,61.6. In these circumstances,, surely no one can say that the industry in Victoria - from which complaints have chiefly come - requires further protection than it enjoyed under the first Federal Tariff. On the contrary, the figures I have quoted show that the Committee would be justified in reducing the duties. </para>

                                <para>- I  suppose that it would be impossible to induce the Government to re-arrange the item. The trade generally complain of the way in which the different items are set out in this part of the schedule. The unanimous opinion of a large meeting of those interested in the trade in South Australia is that this Tariff is more complicated from the point of view of administration than any Tariff hitherto in operation in that State. The inconvenience is experienced in connexion with clearances, and so forth ; and it is urged that there ought to be a re-arrangement of the items under different headings. Through lack of business knowledge the Customs authorities do not appear to have fully appreciated the difficulties which arise from the present arrangement of the items ; and greater simplicity is required.  I  suppose that this item will, more than any other, affect the dwellers in the bush and country districts, who, necessarily, have to wear made-up apparel. The local output is not anything like equal to the demand, and the consumer will now have to pay 40 per cent. plus business charges, seeing that the great bulk of the goods come from the United Kingdom. One effect of a high duty of this kind is to greatly increase retail prices, or to lead to the substitution of shoddy, not only by importers, but by local manufacturers.  I  hope the Committee will show some consideration for that large section of the community who, of necessity, purchase madeup apparel. Of course, it is unfortunate that people have to wear clothes at all, but there is the fact ; and  I  venture to say that the coming winter, not only in regard to clothing, but also in regard to foods, will be felt very severely as a result of the Tariff. Such a duty as that proposed shows very little consideration on the part of the Government for the comfort and wellbeing of the people. </para>

                            <para>.- It is refreshing to find some honorable members remembering that there are such people as consumers. The honorable member for Maranoa and others have shearers amongst their constituents ; and I should like to ask those honorable members what protection men so engaged will have under this Tariff. There are some 13,000 people, men and women, engaged in the Post and Telegraph Department, and there are many thousands engaged in the various Railway Departments, Education Departments, and other Departments of the States ; and I ask what protection are they afforded under these fiscal proposals of the Government? All our attention has lately been given to manufacturers; and, I have taken the trouble to ascertain that out of the total population of Australia of 4,200,000, there are only some 267,000 employed in manufactures. </para>

                                <para>- I have in no way changed my opinions. I regret that, at that time, honorable members considered it necessary to impose a duty as high as 25 per cent. on apparel. Before that time, in most of the States, the maximum duty had been 20 per cent. ; and yet, under the increased duty of 25 per cent., we have not found any decrease in the imports, which, on the contrary, have, during the last seven years, increased year by year. </para>

                                <para>- Whatever duties may be imposed on textiles and apparel, importations cannot possibly be prohibited. It is certainly time that we had some practical man to deal with Tariff proposals of the kind before us; we ought not to permit a frenzied leap in the dark. My firm opinion is that, even under the Tariff proposed by the Minister, if it be passed, textiles and apparel will continue to be imported as heretofore, and that there really will be no opportunity presented for developing their manufacture in Australia. Honorable members ought to consider how little there is of the garments we are wearing at the present time manufactured in Australia, and how little it is possible to have manufactured here within the generation to which we belong. </para>

                                <para>- The denial of the honorable member will not influence practical experienced men. I say that it is impossible in Australia now to weave the yarns which are necessary for the manufacture of garments such as those we are now wearing. There are a few yarns made in Australia, but not a tithe of what are necessary to manufacture goods of the kind. However, all that is beside the question. I find that under the old duty of 25 per cent. imported goods, invoiced at £100, were retailed at £197. I hope honorable members will give their attention to what I regard as a most important fact. Under the operation of the old rate of duty, namely, 25 per cent. it was necessary that the retailer should obtain at the very least £197 for goods of an invoiced value of £100. In other words, apparel and textiles, which in England were worth £100, had to be retailed in the Commonwealth at nearly £200. If we agree to the Government proposal the price of these goods to the consumer will be considerably enhanced. In the first place, we have to recollect the arbitrary provision in the Customs Act under which 10 per cent. is added to the invoice value of goods for Customs purposes. We know perfectly well that so far as apparel and textiles are concerned a charge of 10per cent. upon their invoice value is altogether disproportionate to the cost of importation, although in respect of many articles the cost of importing more nearly approximates 30, 40, and 50 per cent. If we add 10 per cent. to goods of the invoice value of £100, and also levy a duty of 25 per cent. upon them, we shall increase their landed cost to £137 10s. Then it is necessary that the importer shall get at least 15 per cent. upon their value to cover his expenses. This would bring their cost up to£158. As there is no retailer in Sydney or Melbourne who could afford to sell goods for less than 25 per cent. on their cost to him- </para>

                                <para>- We thus increase the value of£100 worth of goods to £197. Surely an article, the cost of which is increased by nearly 100 per cent. in transit is already sufficiently protected? Do honorable members think it is fair to the consumer that more than 100 per cent. should be added to the invoice value of goods? If that measure of protection be not sufficient the industry is unworthy of our attention. In other words we should be paying too dearly for increasing the number of our mills and the number of our factory employés by adopting the Government proposals. But in addition to the primage of 10 per cent. upon the invoice value of goods to which I have referred, the Treasurer now proposes to levy a charge upon the cost of the cases in which they are imported - a charge which is at least equal to 3 per cent. upon their invoice value. Surely honorable members know that these cases which come from abroad are chiefly used for the purposes of firewood. Certainly none of them are worth one-tenth of their invoice value. Notwithstanding this fact, however, it is seriously proposed to levy an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rate upon them. It will thus be seen that under this Tariff the landed cost of £100 worth of goods will be increased to £113. If we impose a duty of 40 per cent. upon this item that will represent an additional £45 4s.,thereby increasing the sum to £158 4s. To this the importer's charge of 15 per cent. has to be added, still further increasing it to £1811s. 7d. The retailer's charge of 25 per cent. upon this sum and the Treasurer himself admits that an allowance of 25 per cent. in this connexion is altogether too small - would bring the amount up to ^227. That would be the cost of goods of the invoice value of £100 in London, before they reached the consumer. I can personally vouch for these facts, and I ask the Committee once more to reflect where the consumer is considered. </para>

                                <para>- The distributors represent a very small proportion of the community. Certainly they do not number 267,000, which is the total number of manufacturers and their employes within the Commonwealth. I am perfectly astounded that the public should sit quietly by and permit this House, almost without protest, to enormously increase the duties even upon the necessaries of life. Before we pursue this course any further we should pause to inquire whether it is necessary for us to do so from the standpoint of revenue, whether the imposition of higher duties will result in increased employment and in the establishment of more factories in our midst, and whether we can manufacture the articles which we are so heavily taxing. The difference between the 25 per cent, duty which was charged under the old Tariff and the 40 ' per cent, which it is proposed to levy -upon British goods under this Tariff will represent an increase, not of 15 per cent., out of ,£29 5s. id. per cent. In that respect it resembles the duty which has been imposed upon chairs, and which is unquestionably a monstrous duty. Despite what the Treasurer may say of the possibility of manufacturing these goods in the Commonwealth, practical men affirm that it will .be impossible to manufacture them, no matter what rate of duty we may impose upon them. Under this Tariff every article used by us, from the cradle to the grave, is to be heavily taxed - from the wicker cradle to the wooden coffin. I have always supported a. revenue Tariff, and we have always secured sufficient revenue. In this connexion I think I might emphasize some remarks that I made on a previous occasion - remarks to which exception was taken bv the Treasurer. My observations were based upon returns pre.sented to the House - returns which showed that this Tariff, during the first month of its operation, produced £200,000 more revenue than did the previous Tariff. The second month's experience of it shows that that increase has been maintained. In other words, the new Tariff will yield approximately ,£2,500,000 more annually than did the old Tariff. </para>

                                <para>- Then I shall not pursue that line of argument any further. I am content to await results. I hope that in respect of apparel and attire we shall revert to the old duty of 25 per cent. If that rate is not sufficient to protect our industries we shall impose these duties in vain, and we shall only assist to provide the Treasurer with a big surplus revenue. Honorable members know the serious results which flow from the possession of large surpluses. We are far better without them. I have already called attention to the fact that out of 4,200,000 persons in the Commonwealth only 267,000 are engaged in pur manufactures. These figures have been obtained from the </para>

                        <para class="block">Government Statistician, and may be relied on. They include all bread-winners, as well boys and girls of the age of sixteen years as married people. If to the number of married people we allow a household of three dependents, the total number of those who are directly and indirectly interested in manufacturing becomes  600,000.  Every one will admit that fair wages are being paid, to those engaged in manufacturing. I believe that our factories cannot employ more hands than are at present working in them, and that they cannot, without new machinery, manufacture goods other than goods of the kind which they are now making, to obtain which machinery a very large outlay of capital would be necessary. It is not likely that much of this special machinery will be imported into Australia. In the United Kingdom, manufacturers limit themselves to particular lines, but our mill-owners attempt to produce different kinds of goods in the one factory, and thus fail to produce so cheaply. In Manchester, Halifax, Liverpool, and other manufacturing centres, the various kinds of textiles are being produced by separate mills, each employing special plant, and if Australia were to try to manufacture all the classes of goods which come under the heading of apparel and textiles, she would have to import new machinery of enormous value, and would have to persuade persons of special skill to come here. As it is claimed that the object of the Government in framing the Tariff was to increase the number of factories . and mills, I ask what has been the effect of the fiscal policies of Victoria and New South Wales during the past twenty or thirty years? Although Victoria had had a protective Tariff for a very long time, so that when these States joined the Federation her factories were .well established, her population during the last seven years has increased by only  5,500  per annum, whereas that of New South Wales, where, prior to Federation, there was no protection for manufactures, has increased by  10,-300  per annum. </para>

                                <para>- If it proves anything, it proves that, notwithstanding the protection which Victoria enjoyed for so long, her industries are not so prosperous as those of New South Wales, which, prior to Federation, were not protected by import' duties. In those lines in which the local manufacture may be expected to overtake the local requirements, it is largely doing so. We cannot supply our own requirements in connexion with all classes of apparel and textiles, but we can supply our requirements in the matter of boots. I find that .Victoria produces 4,000,000 pairs of boots annually, whilst the population of the Commonwealth is only about 4,200,000  ;  so that most of the boots worn by our people are made in Australia. </para>

                                <para>- From the <inline font-style="italic">Journal of Commerce,</inline> a few days ago. They were copied from the trade returns. I ask honorable members who, do they think, will have to pay for these enormous increases in duties ? While we may be prepared to give a great deal of consideration to the  267,000  persons employed in manufacturing, we must not lose sight of the interests of the millions who constitute the total population of the Commonwealth. In all the Tariffs with which I have been associated for nearly forty years past, I have endeavoured to impose such duties as will, first, produce revenue, and, secondly, not only incidentally but necessarily, increase the number of factories, and provide additional employment. The reports of the Tariff Commission show that not one manufacturer in Tasmania, has asked for higher rates of duty than those imposed by the Kingston Tariff. With duties of  20  per cent, the manufacturers of Tasmania have been able to largely supply the requirements of the State in the matter of boots, hats, shirts, apparel, woollens, blankets, and flannel. Such articles have been produced in Tasmania more satisfactorily than similar articles have been produced on the mainland, where in some of the States .the duties were higher. With these  20  per cent, duties, manufacturers were able to enlarge their factories, duplicate their machinery, and increase <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> number of their hands, without unnecessarily increasing prices. If, by increasing the Tariff rates unduly, you increase prices, you must increase wages. In the past I have been in favour of increasing wages, but, when wages are unduly increased, workmen have to pay more for their t009, clothing, rent, and it seems to me that in Australia we may have reached a time when wages cannot be increased further with advantage to the working classes. How many new mills is it hoped will be established, and how many extra persons is it thought will be employed, if the proposed rate is agreed to?. Supposing the answer to those questions to be satisfactory, I ask, is it worth while to increase by perhaps 100,000 the number of persons employed in manufacturing, to the disadvantage of the 4,000,000 consumers who have been so little considered in the framing of the Tariff? </para>

                            <para>. - The honorable member for Denison says that we are legislating for the. 267,000 persons employed in factories, for whose benefit 4,000,000 other persons who are not connected with manufacturing are to be taxed. But, in the first place, the 267,000 persons to whom he has referred as connected with factories are bread winners, and have many others dependent on them, while, in the second place, in a community like this,- every class is so interdependent, that it is impossible to draw a rigid line of demarcation between those who are interested in manufacturing industries and those who are interested in the producing industries. Those engaged in manufacturing and their dependents must give an immense amount of employment to those engaged in producing. We have also been told that our factories are going continually, and cannot produce enough to supply the demands of Australia. No doubt, those who have made that statement "believe it to be true, but I know that it is not. For eight months out of the twelve, the large (clothing factories are going at a fair speed ; but, during the remaining four months, those connected with them earn very poor wages, and . a very large quantity of wearing apparel is annually imparted. Do not our own people require consideration ? </para>

                                <para>- That will not be the effect of increasing the duties. I am speaking with some special knowledge of this subject. In Australia, taking the rates of wages into consideration, we get as good value for our money in wearing apparel as is to be obtained in any other part of the world. If the duties were lowered, the wages of those employed in our factories would be lowered. But the increasing of duties will not .increase the price of wearing apparel, although it will give more work to those who are employed in making it, and will open up new avenues of employment for the benefit of those who are without work. Even those who are opposed to the proposals of the Government will admit that, in the clothing industry in Australia, there is a great deal of competition. There are not dozens, but hundreds of factories making wearing apparel of all sorts, and the competition between them is extraordinarily keen. It was rather cruel to- say that we who desire to protect the manufacturing industries of Australia have no consideration for those in the back blocks. It can be proved beyond assertion to the contrary that with regard to two commodities - boots and wearing apparel protection, instead of increasing, has reduced prices. Under our protective system we receive for our money as good value as is obtainable in any other country, having regard to Australian wages and conditions of labour. We have conclusive evidence that protective duties do not tend to permanently increase prices. The effect of a duty may be to slightly increase prices for a time, but local competition soon comes into play, and reduces them to their normal level. Those who do not represent constituencies in which apparel is manufactured need have no fear as to the effect of the Government proposal ; local competition is sure to keep down prices to a reasonable level, and no man will- be called upon to pay more for these goods than he ought to do, having regard to the wages that' he receives. </para>

I know that, in the eyes of many honorable members, that is enough to make him anathema. So far as I am aware in Victoria, there is no crime so bad as that of being an importer. I suppose that from the point of view of some honorable members the best thing to do with importers in Victoria is to shoot them at sight; apparently they ought to be destroyed <inline font-style="italic">instanter.</inline> I have no doubt, however, that they are fulfilling a very useful function; if they were not they would not exist. I do not share the view of some honorable members, who shrug their shoulders the moment the name of an importer is mentioned. I believe it to be a fact that we cannot supply all our own requirements, and therefore it is the height of folly to make it impossible to obtain supplies from oversea. I shall be the very last to stand in the way of any effort to facilitate the operation of our Victorian manufacturers. </para>

                                <para>- I believe they are doing very well under the present duty. The honorable member for Illawarra mentioned the remarkable fact that none of these manufacturers . whose business is said to be in course of being strangled, went before the Commission to complain. Only one witness made any complaint regarding the alleged insufficiency of the old duties relating to this item. Had the manufacturers been <inline font-style="italic">in extremis,</inline> had their industry been in a parlous condition, such as has been alleged, they would readily have availed themselves of a Commission prepared to hear their complaints, with the possibility of a remedy being found. The fact that they did not appear before the Tariff Commission may be accepted as proof that they were doing fairly well under the old Tariff. That being so, why are we unnecessarily piling on these duties. Under the old Tariff there was a fair duty of 25 per cent. plus a very large natural protection, which the honorable member for Denison has pointed out makes the total protection very high indeed, and having regard to that fact I move - </para>

                            <para>.- Honorable members of the Opposition, whilst pleading for the importers, have accused honorable members on this side of the House of fighting for the manufacturers. They have pointed out that our manufacturers are few in number, and they are disposed to be angry because we wish to abolish the business of importing. In this connexion, I have only to say that there is ample room for our importers to invest their capital in woollen manufactories. The imposition of a substantial Tariff instead of injuring them will afford them an opportunity to invest their money in a more solid business, which will be beneficial to the Commonwealth. The people of Australia can make up woollen goods as well as can those of any other country. My chief reason for desiring that work to be done here is that I think the farmers of Australia should have the pleasure of feeding the workers who make up their raw material. I heard just now a plea for the poor shearers, who go far into the interior to carry on their industry. Half of those men are engaged, for the greater part of the year, in farming. They pro- duce food which the workers in our factories consume, and they do not lose sight of that fact. I desire not only to provide the primary producers of Australia with a splendid home market, such as is open to the primary producers of the United States of America, but to see thousands of men engaged in our factories working up the raw materials produced in Australia, so that if we ever have to defend ourselves we shall be able to obtain from within the Commonwealth the men and the food and clothing that we require. The honorable member for Melbourne Ports was on solid ground when he urged that the extent of our importations of these goods showed that an increased duty was necessary. In passing, I should like to point out that the Government propose duties of 30 and 35 per cent, <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> woollen piece goods, and that I think that an increase of those duties to 35 and 40 per cent, would not be unreasonable on made-up goods. I hope that the Government proposal in this case will be carried. There is no industry which could be more truly described as native to Australia than is that of woollen manufacture. We produce sufficient wool not only for our own use, but to supply thousands of the looms of Belgium, Germany. England, France, and other countries. It has been argued that certain patterns of woollens cannot be produced in Australia. The reason is that the turnover of our factories is not large enough. The population is not sufficient to justify the production of an immense variety ; but if we wish to encourage our manufacturers to obtain up-to-date machinery, and to specialize, we should endeavour first of all to give them the local market, and then to expand that market by means of. an increased population.  There are certain lines which every one admits can be produced in Australia. Some Australian tweeds are really magnificent, and I should like to see them exported as well as used locally. We produce wool in immense quantities, and why should we not export the tweed as well as the raw material ? I should also like an almost prohibitive duty to be imposed on blankets. Why cannot Australia largely export them? The honorable member for Denison was at one time engaged in the importing trade, and I am prepared to discuss with him the question of prices. What prices do we pay today for the woollen goods containing a ' large admixture of shoddy? We start by taking the wool from the sheeps' backs to the sea-board, and then sending it on a trip round the world. The Australian who buys goods made abroad from Australian wool has to pay for that trip. The wool is taken to the wharves from the railway, and certain charges are incurred in getting it on board the boats. It is then shipped to foreign countries., a charge, of course, being made for freight and landing when it arrives. It is then taken to the factories- at another charge, and there made up. </para>

                                <para>- I can quite understand the anxiety of the honorable member to side-track me. I am now stating something which is not quite obvious to everybody, because they have not thought out the question. It is suggested that Australian manufactured woollens must necessarily be shoddy - that if we have protection in the country where the wool itself is produced we shall find shoddy placed on the market. However that may be, after all those charges have been paid, the manufactured wool makes a return trip to Australia, other charges of course being incurred; and then it is sold, in the shape of clothing, to Australian consumers. Yet importers wish us, as intelligent men, to believe that woollen goods could not be sold cheaper in Australia if they were manufactured on the spot. I have argued over and over again that when the raw material is produced in a country, and manufacture can be carried on to any extent, it may reasonably be expected that the finished article will be produced more cheaply there than in any other country. Honorable members opposite appear to be a little hilarious over my description of the trip of our wool round the world. There is, however, just another . item tq which I should like to call attention, namely, the importer's profit. I am very sorry that the honorable member who preceded me did not give us more- information on this point. </para>

                                <para>- I am quite aware that under the present distributors' methods, with private enterprise, in .Australia as elsewhere, there seems to be a tremendous price added to the real value of the goods. I hope, however, before long to have the opportunity to -vote for a. measure which will enable us to deal with those persons who charge exorbitant prices; and, if anything be done in this connexion, we ought to deal not only with importers, but any other distributors who penalize the public. I have previously spoken of prices being raised in consequence of the Tariff, but, as a matter of fact, prices have been raised in relation to articles which bear no duty whatever. It seems to me, however, that if a storekeeper or a merchant desires to buy a motor car or anything else, he can always raise prices independently of the Tariff. However, free-trade  will not make people honest; if a dealer desires to be dishonest, he will be dishonest no matter what the fiscal policy of the country may be. I admit that for some years to come the manufacturers in Australia will not be able to produce all the patterns which are now imported, and that, therefore, certain classes of apparel must continue to come from abroad. But a plea has been made on behalf of the poor workers. These people are not able to afford the fancy materials; and those who demand them can very well afford to pay any little extra price that may be asked.  1  only wish that every poor man could afford to buy two or three suits made of the best Australian tweed, because I am sure that they would be then very well clothed. Another amusing argument has been advanced ' in reference to the number of people employed in this industry. It must be remembered that all the people outside the Public Service - and even public servants assist in distribution - are producers. </para>

It has also been contended that an increase of wages is really of very little benefit, seeing that the price of commodities is raised accordingly. I do not see how that state of things can be altered by abolishing a Tariff ; but if workers find that they are being penalized in that way, they have one remedy, outside a good system of arbitration, namely, co-operation, to which I hope they will resort. </para>

                            <para>.- If the honorable member for New England had had the advantage, or the disadvantage, of being a member of the Federal Parliament when the first Tariff was under discussion, we should, perhaps, have been spared such a dissertation on the merits of protection as that with which he has just favoured us. We went all through that kind of thing <inline font-style="italic">ad nauseam</inline> a few years ago. I can assure the honorable member that anything he has said on the subject at the present time is very stale news to those of' us who went through the mill in connexion with the last Tariff. Theories of protection are very beautiful until we come to analyze them. The fallacy of that system whereby all may become rich and prosperous, like the old ladies in the French village, by taking in each other's washing, has been exposed time and again ; but the honorable member inflicts it on us once more. Let me remind the honorable member that, supposing we desired to protect to the very utmost town industries, we can only ' afford protection to a very small fraction of them. The carpenter, the butcher, the baker, and hundreds of others engaged in town industries, can derive no benefit whatever from any protective duty Parliament can impose. When it comes to dividing up the work between country and town - when we come to consider the advantage of the town producer buying from the country producer, and <inline font-style="italic">vice versa</inline> - the protectionist forgets entirely that a comparatively few farmers can produce sufficient for an immense number of residents in town. The moment an overflow of rural produce into foreign markets takes place, then the rural producer derives no benefit whatever from any protective duty. If the rural producer has to depend on town consumption alone for his market, even in Australia, with our handful of farmers,  comparatively  speaking, the number of the latter would have to be reduced in the most disastrous fashion in order that the method* of primitive barter should be continued according to the ideas of the honorable member for New England. That honorable member has given us a . magnificent argument in favour of low duties,' or of no duties, in connexion with many Australian industries, particularly the woollen industries. He has quoted to us the remarkable series of charges on Australian' wool which is sent abroad in order to be manufactured into cloth for ultimate consumption in Australia. If the honorable member reads the report of the freetrade section of the Tariff Commission on the woollen industries, he will find all those facts related very carefully, as a striking illustration »of the enormous amount of natural protection enjoyed by woollen manufacturers in this country. I am not one who desires to encourage the importer ; I say undoubtedly that Australia should manufacture all, in reason, for her own requirements. But any one who has  observed the peculiar circumstances of Australia ought to realize that our geographical isolation from the manufacturing centres of the world is such that any industry, which has a chance of success under existing natural conditions, will Le far better left alone. We ought not to impose upon the rest of the community a tax in order to bring it .into existence before natural conditions would otherwise operate. If we attend to the natural development of the country, we shall find 'all those industries in which the honorable member is so much interested gradually following that development. The object-lesson in Australia at the present time ought to be sufficient to make the honorable member pause with regard to the alleged advantages of protection, especially when he finds that the capital city of a highly protected State, such as Victoria, has a greater proportion of population than is in the whole State behind. Such a condition of affairs is fraught with danger to any country. When the honorable member speaks of the necessity for population in order to protect Australia, does he mean that there should be a system by which we crowd all our youths into unhealthy factories, and leave our immense areas lacking that bone and sinew which would undoubtedly bring wealth to the country, and advance the interests of the whole community ? </para>

                        <para class="block">These statements speak for themselves. The honorable member for Illawarra has shown that the industry is growing steadily, and I am quite sure that if it were left alone, under the old rate of duty, it would continue to grow until the importations from abroad, which produce such a feeling of horror in the minds of honorable members like the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, had entirely disappeared. It would be far better for the industry that those importations should be wiped out gradually than that any violent measures should be taken with that end in view. I am satisfied that by increasing the duty from 25 to 40 per cent, we shall not benefit the industry, but undoubtedly we shall disadvantage the consumer. Of course, it may be argued that the industry progressed under the high duty which was formerly imposed under the Victorian Tariff. In this connexion, I wish to read an extract from the finding of a Board which was appointed in 1895 to inquire into the fiscal system of this State. </para>

This factory does a large business with Western Australia and the other States, and the gentleman in question assured me that he had no intention whatever of appearing before the Tariff Commission, because he was well satisfied with the existing duty. I saw him again a few weeks ago, and he then informed me that the Government proposals were preposterous, that there was absolutely no justification for an increase in the old rate of duty, that his factory was working at the highest pressure, and that it was maintaining its maximum output. I may add that it is a factory which pays good wages to its employes, and in which the general conditions which obtain will compare favorably with those of the best factories in Australia, and indeed of any other part of the world. </para>

                                <para>- No. The fact that no <inline font-style="italic">bonâfide</inline> manufacturer has asked for higher duties is surely sufficient evidence that the preposterous rates proposed by the Government are not desired, even by those engaged in the industry itself. I trust that the Committee will pause before it adopts a duty which will undoubtedly constitute a serious tax upon the community. I wish now to point out what I conceive to be a mistake in regard to the classification of these items. In the form in which the Tariff has been presented to us, we are asked to deal first with manufactured articles, whereas we ought to begin with the consideration of the duties to be levied upon the raw materials - that is upon piece goods. The free-trade section of the Tariff Commission suggested a classification to the Government, which they have carefully ignored, but which I venture to think would have been a vast improvement upon the classification which they have adopted. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member wishes us to assume that under this Tariff there will be an increase of production, but not an increase of price. That is certainly not the experience of the highly-protected countries of the world. Take the great protectionist example, namely, America. One of the chief complaints that we hear is that American manufacturers are "dumping" their surplus into Australia. The reason they are able to do this is that their own market has been so assured to them that they can charge the home consumers a price sufficiently high to reimburse them for selling at a loss in foreign markets. I ask my protectionist friends if they wish to reproduce a similar state of things here? Do they desire our local market so secured to our manufacturers that the latter will be able not only to supply that market, but to "dump " goods in foreign countries? We are told that that is what obtains in protectionist countries, and we are asked to impose a duty upon importations into Australia to give fair play to Australian manufacturers- But axe not our consumers to be considered? In my electorate there are no big factories. My constituents are primary producers, men who have to go on the land, and battle hard for their livelihood. They have been successful in meeting the requirements of the Commonwealth, and now depend chiefly on foreign markets for their returns from wool, meat, wheat, and other exports. Our farmers have to sell their wheat in Mark Lane, against the competition of the farmers of every other country. They do not receive any special coddling. </para>

                                <para>- I do not wish to do so, but I am constrained to make this plea on behalf of the primary producers, who are the wealth makers of the Commonwealth. I desire that consideration be extended to them. Moreover, I do not wish to see here the conditions which, we have been informed by protectionists, exist in protectionist countries. I shall be willing to support methods brought forward to prevent such conditions from arising here. In the Committee there is a majority pledged to support higher duties ; but we cannot know, until a division has been taken, what rates any particular member will support, and while the minds of honorable members are open to a certain extent, I ask them to consider the position of the producers as well as that of the manufacturers. I am bv no means hostile to the encouragement- of local manufactures, but I wish to see it done by fair and legitimate methods. One section of the community should not benefit at the expense of a larger section which has to contend with the forces of nature. I do not desire that additional burdens shall be placed on the shoulders of our graziers and farmers. If we get a Tariff such as some of the extreme city protectionists desire, we shall, perhaps, find that, like the old woman in the fable, we have killed the goose that lays the golden eggs. Our manufacturers must largely depend upon the support of our producers, and, if the conditions of those on the land are made harder, and their earnings reduced, the manufacturers will ultimately suffer. The honorable member for New England drew an interesting picture of the methods in which wool is obtained on our stations and farms,, and the different processes through which it goes before being shipped to the Old .Country, to be returned to us in thi: form of tweed and cloth. He argued that we should do our own manufacturing, and even said that he would prevent all importations. I ask him, would he prevent all exportation? If he is not prepared to prevent the exportation of our wool, gold, wheat, minerals, and other products, he must be prepared to admit importations as a <inline font-style="italic">quid pro quo,</inline> because we must buy in exchange for what we sell. I would direct his attention, and that of those who think with him, to the fact that many of the Victorian woollen manufacturers have not been satisfied to manufacture Australian wool, but, in order to increase their profits, have largely adulterated it with cotton. The Tariff Commission obtained samples of imported and locally manufactured woollen goods, to make a comparison between them in respect to adulteration. The subsequent analyses disclosed that of thirty-six samples of imported flannel, five contained cotton in proportions varying from  28  to  40.4  per cent., while of twenty Victorian samples, fifteen contained cotton in proportions of from  26  to  58  pet cent. </para>

I am not surprised that the  Chairman,  an enthusiastic protectionist, received the first analyses with doubt. When it was known that further samples were to be collected, the Department, in the attempt to obtain them, met with extraordinary difficulties. </para>

                                <para>- Yes. The second series of analyses disclosed that of 136 samples of imported flannels, fifteen, or 11 per cent., contained cotton in proportions varying from .8 to 63.4 per cent. ; while of the' samples of Australian flannels, -forty-nine in number, forty, or 81 per cent., contained cotton in proportions of from .3 to 87.1 .per cent. The Australian flannels were obtained from Victoria, and New South Wales, and of thirty-nine Victorian samples, two were all wool, while four out of ten of the New South Wales samples were pure wool. According to the <inline font-style="italic">Year-Book of Victoria</inline> for 1903, in 1899 cotton amounting to 154,388 lbs. was imported, while the importation in 1900 was 178.332 lbs.; in 1901, 250,184 lbs.; in 1902, 273,335 1bs. - a considerable increase - and in 1903, 368,749 lbs. - a still greater increase. The report shows that the use of cotton in woollen goods is practically confined to Victoria; it does not appear to be used as an adulterant in New South Wales or the other States to anything like the same extent. Yet the Victorian woollen industry has been coddled for twenty-five years. Although millions of pounds of wool have, during that period, been exported, the local manufacturers of woollen goods have, in some cases, used as much as 81 per cent, of cotton in their production. Now they are asking for duties of 40 and 45 per cent, to protect them from outside competition. I ask the honorable member for New England, is he- willing to support these high duties for the purpose of protecting manufacturers who resort to practices such as I have spoken of ? The Tariff Commission's investigations showed that adulteration takes place in imported goods in respect to a smaller number of articles, and to a lesser degree, than in locally manufactured goods. Before the Committee consent to increase the protection of the local manufacturers, something should be done to compel them to use Australian wool, and to prevent them from selling as woollen goods fabrics which contain a very large proportion of cotton. Under the old Tariff local manufacturers had a very fair margin to work upon. The reports of the Tariff Commission show that one manufacturing .interest, with a capital of <inline font-style="italic">£3°-°°°,</inline> under the old Tariff has been paying 15 per cent, dividends. Many of those engaged in primary industries would be glad to obtain such a return upon their investments. Whilst honorable members are pleading for the manufacturer, I should like to ask : What is the position of the farmer, the settler, and the shearer? Are their interests to be considered, as well as the interests of those who are actually engaged in this industry? If it can be shown that they are safeguarded, I shall be prepared to allow the whole matter to go, but until I am satisfied on that point </para>

                            <para>.- I do not wish to discuss this question, at length, but it seems to me that a number of honorable members have rather missed the point in dealing with the adulteration of so-called woollen goods with cotton. The adulteration in respect of which the honorable member for Calare has expressed so much concern has occurred under what we consider the inadequate duty of 25 per cent, which has prevailed during the last five years. </para>

                                <para>- Quite so. That shows that the practice has nothing whatever to do with the imposition of high or low protective duties. Any one who chooses to make inquiries on "the subject will ascertain that it is due to the keen competition between different wholesale as well as retail houses. When a representative of a wholesale house says to a ' manufacturer, "We will take your goods at so much per yard," knowing very well that those goods must consist of an admixture of wool and cotton if they are to be made at the price offered, he is largely responsible for the practice. </para>

                                <para>- -They cannot sell all that they produce. A Tasmanian manufacturer of flannels who puts no cotton into his goods last year did not make a penny profit because he could not obtain an output for his manufactures. Honorable members are simply wasting their time in talking about the responsibility of the Tariff for adulterations. It is useless for us to expect our local manufacturers to maintain a high standard unless we deal with the retailing of all classes of locally made and imported goods. The only way to prevent goods containing cotton from being sold as flannel is to absolutely prohibit their sale, whether they be made in Australia or abroad. So long as we have offered for sale in Australia <inline font-style="italic">;m</inline> ported "flannels" containing a large proportion of cotton, it stands to reason that the local manufacturers, in order to obtain a footing in the market in respect of the cheaper lines, must also he prepared to adulterate their goods. The practice of selling as flannel fabrics containing a large proportion of cotton is the worst that could prevail. lt is especially injurious to the poorer classes, and ought to be prohibited by law. </para>

I dare say that the honorable member is aware that retailers are always on the lookout for cheap lines. They say to a wholesale house, " Can you supply us with a line to sell at, say, 6d. or od. a yard"? The wholesaler replies, " Oh, yes, but you will have to take an admixture of wool and cotton." The retailer probably answers, " That is all right; as long as it has a good appearance, and we- can sell it at the rate named, we shall be satisfied." </para>

                                <para>- Quite so. But even if we had no duty on this line the people would be subjected to such treatment at the hands of commercial houses. I do not blame any soft-goods warehouse. It is the competition which goes on that forces .them to go a little further and further in the direction of adulteration. </para>

                                <para>- I am inclined to think that we have no power to deal with the question except in regard to Inter-State trade and imports from abroad. Our constitutional power in this respect is very limited. I would urge honorable members to recognise that the question of adulteration, in so far as woollens are concerned, has no bearing whatever upon the Tariff. Adulteration is the inevitable result of keen competition amongst those who are catering for the public, and unless the authorities step in and prohibit that class of trade the practice will continue, and the people will suffer even if we remove the duty on woollens. </para>

                            <para>.- I admit that on some of the minor items there has been an unduly long debate ; but the Treasurer must agree that this is one of, perhaps, half-a-dozen items in the Tariff which are so important that it is really necessary that some of us should express our views upon them. I look upon this item, and the next half-dozen, as being amongst the most important that' we shall have to consider, and if there has been a waste of time in connexion with minor items that' is no justification for the plea that we should not discuss those of importance. </para>

                                <para>- Not if I can help it. I am very much struck with the wonderfully philosophic attitude taken up in connexion with this matter by the honorable member for South Sydney. During the recent general election in New South Wales, two of the leaders of the Labour Party in that State - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGowen</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fred.</inline> Flowers - came down in post haste to Melbourne to see the head of the "ustralian Labour Party with a view of endeavouring to relieve the masses of the people from some of the more exorbitant duties that are included in this Tariff. The honorable member for South Sydney will admit that clothing is one of the necessaries of life, and that this duty is of the greatest consequence to the poorer classes of the community. A tax of 50 per cent, or 100 per cent, is a matter of perfect indifference to the wealthy, but the position is different in respect to the great masses of the people who have to look carefully at every shilling they spend in maintaining the decency of their homes and families? What is one of the chief items of expenditure of the wives of the workers ? It is the clothing of the husband, the wife, and the children. This is not a matter to laugh about. Millionaires, or those who have an income of ,£2,000 or £3,000 a year, can afford to laugh at the duty, but to the great masses of the workers in all industries it is unquestionably a serious matter. To those who believe that high duties tend to make goods cheaper and better, this is a joyful occasion. They would put on another 50 per cent., and spread cheapness and plenty of clothing among the homes of Australia. Why have they not the courage of their professed beliefs, if they think that the higher we raise the barrier between the abundance of the rest of the world and the needs of Australia, the surer we are to promote cheapness and competition, and all the blessings of a happy life? But from my point of view, even the protectionist must always be prepared to draw a line, because the moment we go beyond a certain point we encourage, not the best kind of competition, but all sorts of illegitimate combinations. It is one thing to say, "We will crush them by Act of Parliament"; it is quite another ' thing to do it. It has not been done yet, and I tell my honorable friends opposite that they will find me helping them in the most thorough way I can to bring to bear upon this matter some sort of scheme in the hope that it will be of service. In the meantime, whilst we are trying to boom manufacturers in the big towns, we should ask ourselves how the spread of cultivation is progressing in the great country districts of Australia. It is at this particular time when we are' seeking to double the hands employed in slop-making factories that we should look at the hard facts of the industry of which our large cities are the costly superstructures. From the Budget papers I have obtained some very ominous facts as to the position of the greatest of our industries - the tilling of the soil of Australia. I find that in 1906-7 the area under crop in Victoria, as compared with the area under cultivation in 1903-4, had declined by 86,000 acres. In Queensland, it has declined by 7,000 acres, in South Australia by 98,000 acres, and in Tasmania by 15,000 acres. </para>

                                <para>- However, we all know that 1906-7 was a grand year for the agricultural industry ; but, in spite of that fact, in four out of the six States there was not only no increase in the area under cultivation, but stagnation or retrogression. The two States which show an increase are New South Wales and Western Australia. In the latter State the figures show a magnificent increase in three years from 283/000 acres to 460,000 acres. New South Wales, with' a very much larger area under cultivation, showed an increase of 280,000 acres. Putting those two States aside, however, there has been something which, at least, looks like stagnation in regard to agriculture. I do not think that the figures for South Australia can be accounted for by the butter industry, which, so far  fi 5  I know, has not shown any marvellous development. While we are looking after the roof of national greatness, and making it more beautiful and strong, we ought to remember that it must rest on foundations, and that the foundations of national strength, in a country like this, must lie in the rural districts and not in the cities. Surely, when we see the trend of population, we can realize that high duties, if they have the result intended, will intensify the crowding of the population into the towns, and away from country industries. Would that be advantageous? I think not. I do not desire to go into ancient history, but merely to mention one fact. When we were under the blighting influence of free ports in New South Wales, in 1900, just before the Federal Union, we had in our clothing factories there 5,676 hands employed, as compared with  6,291  hands employed in Victoria after twenty or thirty years of high protection, represented by duties ranging from 25 to 50 per cent. I point this out merely to show that it is not necessarily suicide to throw our ports open. </para>

                                <para>- Fortunately, we have a common interest in disposing of the Tariff as soon as we can, without, of course, forgetting our duty as representatives of the people. That duty we must not forget, and, apart from that, we are all anxious to expedite public business. We have heard something about adulteration, and my friends opposite find the grand secret in competition. Of course, there is some truth in that view ; but one of the greater causes of adulteration is high Tariffs. If a policy be adopted which tends to increase prices - which enables traders to in crease prices whether rightly or wrongly - what is the inevitable result? It is that those who sell to the public will try to meet the natural craving there is for cheap articles. That is the most natural craving in the world with those who have only a few shillings to spend; and, really, it is not a craving, but a necessity. If wages are limited, articles are not bought at all unless at a low price, and even high wages form no abundant fund. The honorable member for South Sydney said easily that we all desire to prevent- adulteration. But if high Tariffs are imposed, consumers have to choose between shoddy and nothing at all, and they are glad to get a garment with any wool in it. If, in a very proper spirit, some law is applied which prevents the sale of woollen garments containing any cotton, then woollen goods are placed beyond the reach of large numbers of persons who have, not money for the purchase of expensive articles. It is notorious that in the United States, where, in many parts, the climate is bitterly cold, the poorer classes, in spite of high wages, cannot afford the luxury of woollen clothing. </para>

                                <para>- That is only right and honest; but I am pointing out that the masses cannot afford the luxury of articles which are beyond a certain price. I do not desire to see the Tariff, even from a protectionist point of view, strung up so tightly as to make the element of wool even more slender in the clothing of people of limited means. There are some commodities which every one ought to have, but, unfortunately, there are people who cannot afford to purchase them, and who have to wear cheaper goods when the higher priced clothing would be more healthy and lasting. </para>

                                <para>- There have been a large number of very able calculations made on the effect which Tariffs have on the purchasing power of wages* The result of a number of inquiries in the United States undoubtedly is that, whilst the Dingley Tariff raised wages to a very substantial extent, the prices of the articles which the wage earners consumed went up so much that the Tariff was absolutely of no benefit to the workers. I know that we freetraders have no chance of carrying our views into effect in this Parliament, but I appeal to protectionists here not to raise the Tariff too high. I make that appeal in the interests of the masses of the people for whom the goods under discussion are the necessaries of life. Of course, we have been told about the extent of the importations, but, naturally, importations increase in prosperous times. We must not forget that the last three or four years have been comparatively very prosperous ones; and, as I say, imports are always much greater under such circumstances than in dull times. We must not conclude, therefore, that the importations are the result of an ominous attack upon the clothing industry. A Tariff Commission was appointed and sent to- the doors of the manufacturers of Australia in order to enable them to bring before Parliament their grievances and claims to increased protection. And the fact that manufacturers did not, in any number, attend and represent their industries as in a troubled state and exposed to adversity is one which we ought not to overlook. It does not show that the industries were being strangled when those concerned did not take the trouble to go before the Commission, which was empowered to hear complaints and recommend relief. Surely if the men most concerned do not trouble to make any complaint, it is one of the strongest proofs in "the world that they are not feeling any pinch. It is of no use endeavouring to represent that this duty is not a serious matter. The actual sovereigns which are being taken out of the pockets of the people through the Customs are being collected, to speak moderately, at the rate of .£2, 000,000 a year. Those two million sovereigns are being paid down by the business men at the Customs House; and we may be sure that by the time the consumers have been supplied, another ,£300,000 or .£400,000 will have been taken from the people of Australia. Surely the people of the country districts are not in a position to give another £2,000,000 a year to the people in the towns? Surely, as it is, the .towns are drawing enough of . the life blood of our country districts? . There never was a more misplaced effort than that represented by this Tariff. I admit, of course, that by a majority the people of Australia have indorsed the protectionist policy, and, in the remarks I am making, I have no desire to lecture. But it is, to my mind, a matter for infinite regret that, at a time when the public should have thought about the primary industries, they supported a policy which looks more to the interest of the towns. It would be absurd to ask that this duty should be reduced below that of the old Tariff. </para>

                                <para>- But I think the honorable member, from his long political experience, will agree that when, one has a majority anything may be done. The Treasurer, when he has a majority, very properly works it for all it is worth, and makes use of it, as he believes, in the interests of the country. I recognise the fact that the majority of honorable members are utterly opposed to my views on the fiscal question, and I merely urge that we should get on some common ground where we can all agree. There is not an honorable member who would dare say that the primary industries are not the foundation of the manufacturing industries. Is there one honorable member - be he the member for Melbourne Ports, for Hume, or for Batman - who, however strong his belief may be in protection, will affirm that the primary industries are not the foundation of all other industries? If we make the primary industries strong and progressive, all other industries must have a better chance. </para>

                                <para>- - Because, while the honor able member agrees with the main premise of my syllogism, he draws most illogical conclusions from it. I get my friends opposite to agree that white is white, but, by their votes, they show that white is black. There is no logical connexion between the argument and the attempt to increase this duty to an extravagant rate in order to benefit the industries of the towns at the expense," to a large extent, of the people who are engaged in the primary industries. Why was there that spasm in favour of the settlers of Australia on the question of wire netting? Upon that item - although there is a large majority of protectionists in this House - there was a spasm of sympathy with the settlers of Australia, which led to the reduction of the duties from 30 per cent, under the general Tariff, and 25 per cent, under the Tariff for the United Kingdom, to 10 per cent, and 5 per cent, respectively. But  surely I am now making an appeal in the interests of a much larger body even than the settlers of Australia. I am appealing in the interests of that great body in this country whose weekly means are limited, and to whom these articles are prime necessaries of life. While I cannot hope to secure a reduction of these rates to the level of revenue-producing duties, surely honorable members will not maintain them at 40 and 45 per cent. </para>

                                <para>- Some time ago the Labour Party suggested that a referendum should be taken upon the fiscal question. I am not quite sure that I did not throw out the suggestion first. I know that two or three years ago, when I mooted the subject, many of the leading newspapers which support free-trade did not agree with the position which I took up. But I said then - as I say now - that to obtain a thorough settlement of the fiscal question we must put it to the people by way of referendum. </para>

                                <para>- I am quite aware of that. I propose, when dealing with the Bill embodying the Tariff resolutions, to put before the country a concrete way of settling the question. But for any honorable member to say that this Tariff was approved by the people would be to make an extraordinary statement. I believe that a majority of the electors have expressed their opinion in favour of a protective as against a free-trade policy, but it is absurd to suggest that at the last election the people knew that duties ranging up to 45 per cent. were to be imposed on apparel. I do not think that there was anybody outside of the Government who contemplated the inclusion in the Tariff of an item of this sort. However, it is idle to talk of a referendum upon the fiscal question until we can arrive at a sensible way of putting a proper  issue to the people. But we shall get no real settlement of the question until it is put to the people apart from all the complications which arise at an election time. For years past I have been in favour of the adoption of that course, and I cannot understand how anybody can shrink from it, if the referendum is put in' a proper way to the electors. I suppose that- the clothing industry will come under the new protection proposals of the Government. I assume that honorable members opposite would not be prepared to vote for higher duties unless they were assured that that was so. Unfortunately, in this particular trade - whether it be under free-trade or protective conditions - there is too much reason to believe that sweating is practised. I believe that there is more sweating in the clothing industry than obtains in any other industry irrespective of whether it is under free-trade or protectionist conditions. </para>

                                <para>- The new protection will, I trust, to some extent do that. I said " I trust," because the ingenuity of some persons in evading an Act of Parliament is simply marvellous. Just as we think we have them, they adopt a simple contrivance, and get out. of their difficulty. However, I am prepared to help any sensible effort to catch people who break the law. We must not forget that before duty is imposed upon any goods, a charge of 10 per cent, is added, to their invoice value. Thus, the duty upon apparel, which is invoiced at .£100, will be calculated upon .£110. A duty of 45 per cent, upon the .£10 thus added would represent nearly £5. Honorable members should not forget that; </para>

                                <para>- But under this Tariff they will be valued upon their arrival, and a high valuation will be placed upon them. At least they depreciate to the extent of one-half the moment that the goods are taken out of them. As the honorable member for Denison has pointed out, the 45 per cent, duty which it is proposed to levy upon this item thus really becomes * 50 per cent. The duty upon the cases will probably add 2 per cent, or 3 per cent., so that honorable members will see that instead of the duties levied upon this item being 45 per cent, and 40 per cent., they are in reality 50 per cent, and 45 per cent. Now, in Victoria, where a protective policy has been believed in to an extent far exceeding the beliefs of the electors of other States, the people have never yet approved of a duty of 50 per cent, upon clothing. I think that in the midst of a financial crisis the duty was raised to 64 per cent. But instead of adding to the revenue, this rate proved most disappointing in its operation, and it was brought down with a run. Consequently in Victoria, which is in a special sense the home of protection, the people have never yet indorsed the imposition of a duty of 50 per cent, upon this line. </para>

I agree with some of his premises; but do not follow the syllogism of the honorable member for East Sydney, as he very aptly remarked. We both agree that it is desirable to stimulate Australian industries, but I think it is a deplorable circumstance that we have annually to import the best portion of £2,000,000 worth of woollen goods into a country which grows more wool than does any other country in the world. </para>

                                <para>- They come in ostensibly as woollen goods. If they were manufactured in 'Australia they would be woollen goods. I am prepared to extend to the clothing industry a little more protection for the purpose of stimulating the development of woollen manufacture in our midst. I admit that we have to incur certain risks, but as nation builders we want to see the Commonwealth progress. It has been laid down again and again that owing to our isolation it is absolutely necessary that we should develop our resources. Consequently we must incur some risk in building up these industries. <inline font-style="italic">I'</inline> am just as keenly alive to the dangers that we have to run as is the honorable member for East Sydney. I agree with him that it is necessary to stimulate our primary industries. But already our primary producers are complaining that they do not possess a sufficient home market. I know that some of them take a short-sighted view, but we must recollect that we have to deal with men who take that sort of view, and meet them as far as we can. They say, when we talk of putting more farmers on the land, " What is the good, until we have more people here to consume their products?" One way of obtaining a larger consumption for their products is to increase the number of persons engaged in manufacturing in Australia. If the leader of the Opposition were willing to make it impossible for any man to hold land who would not put it to the best uses, I should be ready to support him, but, holding the views which he does, and backed by the Corner Party, I feel that if he were in power we should find it more difficult to stimulate primary production than it is under present circumstances. In my opinion, these prices will not be increased by raising the rates' of duty. Locally made tweeds are cheaper than imported tweeds, if not quite so good in some instances. That they are not more sought after is not so much because of their want of quality as because of the prejudice against them. </para>

                                <para>- We can take means to put a stop to adulteration of that kind. T think that we should compel the public to be patriotic, if they will not be so of their own accord. I know that when I order a suit of clothes I frequently do not think to. say to the tailor that I require colonial tweed, and, no doubt, the leader of the Opposition and others often forget to do so' - supposing that they are patriotic enough to desire to wear locally-manufactured clothing. I am quite prepared to be compelled to use Australian tweeds, and I think that patriotic Australians hold the same views as I do. ' Many tailors whom I have consulted have told me that the effect of the duties has not been to increase prices, and that Australian tweeds are cheaper than the imported tweeds. It has been said that wham we have more effective protection the Australian manufacturers will unduly increase prices; but we have the promise of the Ministry that legislation will be introduced, which the honorable member for East Sydney has volunteered to support, to provide against such imposition. Surely, we are not going to admit that we are unable to cope 'with all the tricks of trade? </para>

                                <para>- The laws could be enforced by the punctilious discharge of Ministerial duty. There is just as much capacity, just as much latent roguery, in those appointed to administer them, as there is in any business man; and I take it that a certain amount of business cunning is needed to deal with business cunning. </para>

                                <para>-  I have proved to my own satisfaction that they, have not. I have made inquiries of numerous importers, and of tailors in particular, and they have told me that prices have not gone up. The prices of local manufactures can be regulated. There is no need for the public to be exploited, either through the medium of the local manufacturers or through the medium of the Customs Department. If the duties give an effective protection, the public cannot be exploited through the medium of the Customs Department, and we can prevent their exploitation by local manufacturers. But, in view of the prejudices which have to be considered, and of the fact that this is a tentative proposal, I think that the rates should be reduced to 40 per cent. in the General Tariff and to 35 per cent. on goods produced or manufactured in the United Kingdom, and I should like to move to bring that about. </para>

                            <para>.- I regret that the Minister has not given way to the representations made to him, to allow the Committee, in considering these duties, to begin at the bottom, laying, in the first instance, a secure foundation. In America some very large buildings have been commenced from the top, but, in the first place, a frame-work has been necessary, and I think that we should do better in this instance in building from the bottom, considering first the duty on piece goods. I should have moved the postponement of preceding items, had I not known, as has been said, that the Treasurer has the numbers behind him, and that it would be useless to do so. </para>

                                <para>- From the general tenor of the Minister's interjections, the Committee may regard that as likely. I have looked for enlightenment in regard to these proposals to the reports of the Tariff Commission, and particularly to those of the protectionist section, but I have not found it. It has been stated that the manufacturers concerned did not come before the Commission for reasons best known to themselves. Had they done so, they would have found themselves in a difficult position, because they would have been asked: ''Are not your mills at present working at high pressure ? " I know that they are. I have made inquiries today, and have ascertained that in some instances orders cannot be filled for six months from date. </para>

                                <para>- In the face of the recommendations of the Tariff Commission, and of the fact that the mills are as full of work as they can be, I think that we shall deal liberally with the industry if we agree to those duties.I shall not discuss this matter in detail, but I have no mandate from my electors to increase the old rates beyond  10  per cent. Such an increase I take to be justified, because, for humanitarian reasons, the Government intend to pass legislation to regulate wages and industry, which, no doubt, will impose additional obligations on manufacturers. </para>

                            <para>. - I hope that honorable members will not agree to the amendment moved by the honorable member for Kooyong. I am quite prepared to accept that foreshadowed by the honorable member for Macquarie. It must not be forgotten that we have yet to deal with piece goods. I desire that there shall be a fair margin between the duties on piece goods and those on the manufactured article, and if this amendment be carried it will prevent us from giving such a margin as I should otherwise like to provide for. I hope that the margin between the two will not be cut down too low. My desire is to bring down the duties on piece goods reasonably low, and to give, at all events, a margin of 10 per cent. between them and those on the manufactured article. </para>

                            <para>. - I trust that the Committee will not be prepared to vote for more than the excessive duties proposed by the honorable member for Kooyong. The first Federal Government introduced a Tariff in which they proposed a duty of only 25 per cent. on this line, and we now have an honorable member who was a member of that Ministry asking us to grant an excessive increase without any reason being offered even by those in the trade. It has been admitted, even by protectionists throughout Australia, that some of the duties in the Tariff press very heavily upon the people, and especially upon the poor of the community. </para>

                                <para>- Many protectionists ; and some of the divisions which have been taken support my statement. Protectionist members of the Labour Party went over to New South Wales during the elections, and some of them stated that they were not responsible for the Tariff - that, in their opinion, some of the duties would bear heavily on the working classes, and that when those duties came to be considered they would be found trying to reduce them. </para>

                                <para>- It is an absolute fact. I am very glad to see this excitement amongst the supporters of a high Tariff, because it shows that my arguments are going home. I hope the Committee will not impose these duties, because the manufacturers themselves have not said they are necessary ; and it is absolutely absurd to imagine that the new protection, if it be applied to selling prices, can reach a trade like this, which deals with such an immense number of articles. </para>

                            <para>. - I desire to protest against the ridiculous and outrageous proposal of the honorable member for Kooyong. That honorable member was returned as a protectionist, and when before the electors he said he would support the protectionist policy. But because of a few anonymous letters in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> which threatened some opposition at the next election, he has never since voted within these walls without having his ear to the ground in order to ascertain, if possible, public opinion. The honorable member is afraid to vote according to his election promises as a protectionist. </para>

                                <para>- I withdraw the latter part of my remarks. If the Committee accept the amendment, there is no possible chance of protecting the woollen industry in relation to piece goods, which have yet to be considered. If the honorable member for Kooyong thinks that this is not an Australian industry which needs protection, he does not know what protection is. I think that the next time the honorable member appeals to the electors as a protectionist they will know what he really is. </para>

                            <para>. - It appears to me that the working classes have no champions in this Committee. Surely honorable members are not prepared to vote in favour of a duty of  35  per cent. on goods which represent a value of  £1,600,000  a year, and which must of necessity be imported for many years to come, no matter what the duty may be. Is no word to be said on behalf of the large body of consumers who will suffer by reason of this impost? I should feel utterly ashamed to vote in favour of even  25  per cent. The free-trade section of the Tariff Commission, after giving the question every consideration, came to the conclusion that a duty of15 per cent. was adequate; and the recommendation by the protectionist section of the Commission, that a duty of  40  per cent. be imposed, was based on the fact that there is adulteration of imported goods. </para>

                                <para>- Shall not a member be heard who comes from a State which represents one-third of the people of Australia, and which will have to contribute nearly  £1,000,000  of this taxation ? The Treasurer is restive if there be any argument ;but if we do not argue this question, what question are we to argue? Personally, I see no  honour  in voting fora duty of  35  per cent. Representatives of the Labour Party have gone all over Australia declaring that they are in favour of reducing the cost of the necessaries of life. I remind those honorable members that the goods under discussion cannot at present be manufactured in Australia, and some years most elapse before the necessary machinery can be obtained. We are told that it is because of the great output in England that these goods are supplied to us at present prices; and there is not the slightest doubt that, even if the duty were made  60  per cent.,  the  local manufacturers could not supply the demand. All the talk about an export trade in this class of goods is beside the question. Every protectionist knows that it is impossible for us to go into the markets of the world and compete successfully with older and better equipped and organized manufacturers. I protest against the excessive duty proposed, and would rather walk out of the House than vote for  35  per cent., were it not for the fact that these goods must be imported whatever the impost, and that I feel it incumbent on me to save the people from being robbed of even  5  per cent. </para>

                                <para>- I rose to point out,  when  item 106 was under consideration,  that its  wording is different from that adopted  in  the Tariff of 1902. In the Tariff of 1902 it was declared that the duty was  not to  apply to piece goods. I am suspicious  of  these alterations, because I find  that the  Minister wishes to bring piece goods  within  item 107, if cut into shape in any  way. </para>

We are departing without explanation from the designations used  in  the Tariff of 1902, and we may find  that  very often, under the pretence of merely altering a heading, the incidence of the  duty  has been altered. It is due to the  Committee  that, when a change such as  that'  now proposed is in contemplation, we should have reasonable notice of it. </para>

                        <para>In dealing with item 106, we reduced the duties from 45 and 40 per cent, to 40 and 35 per cent., and I have proposed this amendment with a view to securing symmetry. I. do not intend to speak at any length, because I shall follow the rule which I have observed in connexion with the telephones since the toll system was introduced, and speak as little as possible. But there is a matter in regard to which I should like an explanation from some New South Wales representative. In Melbourne, corsets are made bv three firms, at prices which range from four guineas to thirteen guineas, and an additional charge of us. 6d. is made for suspenders. In Sydney they are made and sold at 9s. 6d. and 1 os. 6d. each. Of course, a girl employed in a factory at a wage of 10s. a week cannot afford luxuries of that kind, and my object in proposing this amendment is to afford her some slight relief. A girl employed in a factory has to pay about 2s. 1 id. for a pair of corsets, and the strain which her work entails upon them is so great that their life is not more than three months. </para>

It will thus be seen that the people of New South Wales are asking for the highest protective duties, and that the representatives of that State, in supporting protective duties, are voting in accordance with the desire of their constituents, and are certainly following the suggestion of the Opposition that they should stand by the evidence given before the Tariff Commission.

                                <para>- As the honorable member put free- trade in a secondary position, he ought not to complain. I do not know that the Committee is very much interested in matters of this kind. However, for whatever we may do we have to answer to our constituents. I resent an assertion that I have " wobbled" or changed my opinion on this question. No doubt, as time goes on, I shall change my opinions on many questions, but I hope that I shall not do so on quite so many as has the honorable member, for Parramatta. </para>

                            <para>. - The honorable member for Batman quoted from the evidence of three witnesses before the Commission, namely, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Moore, Mr. Blackman,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vicars.</inline> But I find that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Moore,</inline> according to the report of the Tariff Commission, said that his company had sent goods into Western Australia previous to Federation, paying the 15 per cent, duty then in existence.' According to this, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Moore's</inline> company had been able to compete successfully in the western State in spite of the duty. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vicars</inline> told the Commission that his company was able to send goods into Victoria, when the duty there was 25 per cent., and that they had been able to compete success- fully. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blackrnan</inline> told the Commission that his firm had sent goods into the Queensland market, under a duty of 15 per cent., and had done quite as much business in that State, under such conditions, as they were doing at present. The honorable member for Batman is mistaken when he says that these gentlemen would not be satisfied with anything under a duty of 50 per cent., because, as a matter of fact, they asked for no higher protection than that given under the Kingston Tariff. I do not think that the honorable member for Batman intended in any way to mislead the Committee, but made a mistake in quoting from a paragraph which he had in his scrap-book. </para>

I understand that the bands referred to are used for the purpose of hanging cloths. Under the old Tariff they were admitted free, and I should like to know whether the Treasurer intends to make a number of these articles free. </para>

                            <para>.- Do I understand that the Treasurer intends to reduce the duties levied upon, this item, so as. to make them harmonize with the reductions which have already been made? The item includes a number of articles which are not made in the Commonwealth, and which are not likely to be made here for a very long time. While I intend to support prohibitive duties upon articles which can be manufactured in Australia, I will not vote for the imposition of revenue duties upon articles which cannot be manufactured here.. I certainly think that duties of 30- per cent, and 25 _ per cent, should not be levied upon articles such as towels, which are not made in the Commonwealth. So far we have never attempted to manufacture cotton goods. I hope that the day will come when we shall manufacture them, but in the meantime we ought not to impose heavy revenue duties upon them. </para>

                            <para>.- I should like to know what the Treasurer has to say in reply to the remarks of the honorable member for Yarra, who Has invited him to  reduce the  duties upon this item. One who is so experienced a protectionist as is the honorable member ought certainly to be able to impress his policy upon the Minister. I have received a communication from Messrs. Stirling and Company,  of Richmond, in reference to this item. After specifying a number of lines which cannot be manufactured in Australia for many years to come, they suggest that the duty upon this item should be 5 per cent. Under the circumstances, the Treasurer might accept the advice of such a staunch protectionist as the honorable member for Yarra and reduce the duty to that rate. </para>

The towels are imported in a woven form, so that one has merely to run a pair of scissors along them to divide them one from the other. I have consistently objected to revenue duties, and- 1 shall continue to do so, especially when they are of a high character, such as are those here proposed. At the same time, I do not wish inadvertently to do an injustice to industries which are carried on in Australia. We all know that saddle cloths and horse rugs can be made in the Commonwealth, and therefore I suggest to the Treasurer that he should select a number of articles not made locally and place them upon the free list. </para>

By placing them upon the free list he may increase their cost to the. consumer. I wish now to put in a plea for canvas water bags. These are used in the Australian bush by men whose lives frequently depend upon their being able to obtain a supply of water. If towels are to be admitted free, why not water bags, which are used by our pioneers? </para>

                            <para>.- I think that we should all feel grateful that the Treasurer intends to be reasonable. He actually proposes to place certain articles upon the free list upon the ground that they cannot be manufactured in the Commonwealth. But I understand that hair curlers and wavers cannot be made in Australia, and, consequently, they ought to be placed upon the free list. Only last week we had a strenuous fight as to whether sausage skins should be admitted free. I wish the people of Australia to understand that, although it is alleged that we cannot make these things, we can make electrical machinery of the most complicated type. The protectionists, as a rule, will take any fence. They say that everything known to civilization can be made in Australia but the honorable member for Yarra has to except towels and canvas water-bags. </para>

                            <para>. - Division V. of the old Tariff contains a number of exemptions, some of which seem to be covered by the exemptions enumerated here, while others do not. Among these exemptions were bandages, elastic stockings, leggings, kneecaps, thigh-pieces, and wristlets, surgical. Are we to understand that, as these articles are not set out under a special heading as exempt, they will be dutiable? </para>

                                <para>- In that case my information is at fault. The dressing of feathers in Australia is an art so well understood that we have now quite a respectable export trade in dressed feathers. Remembering the conditions under which ostrich feathers are grown in South Africa, and the cost of importing them, honorable members will see that ostrich farms in Australia will not be prejudiced if undressed feathers are admitted duty free. Last year the revenue from this duty was only  £524.  The placing of this item on, the free list would stimulate the industry of dressing ostrich feathers, and would not affect ostrich farmers in Australia. I move) - </para>

                            <para>. - Under the preferential Tariff agreement with South Africa, ostrich feathers coming from that country are dutiable at  10  per cent. That should largely remove the objection which the honorable member for Corangamite has to this duty.. The preference granted to South Africa would stand unless, with the consent of that country, we made an alteration in the agreement. I therefore hope that the honorable member will not press his amendment. </para>

                            <para>.- This amendment has been moved by the honorable member for Corangamite on behalf of the honorable member for Fawkner, in whose electorate there is a factory devoted to the dressing of ostrich feathers. It is interesting to observe that whilst a duty of 40 per cent. has been imposed upon apparel and attire - an item of great concern to the masses of the community - the honorable member for Fawkner considers that ostrich feathers used for the personal adornment of those who could well afford to pay a high duty should come in free, because there is a feather-dressing industry in his constituency. I am going back on my free-trade principles to the extent of voting for a thumping big duty on this item. When I cannot induce the Committee to reduce a duty on some of the necessaries of life, I am not going to agree to such an item as this being placed on the free list. This is a rattling revenue item. </para>

If the old duty were increased, the feathers and down of our domestic birds, which are now being absolutely wasted, would be dressed and put to good use. We can grow good mutton, good poultry, and good feathers, and I am prepared to support any proposal by the honorable member for Dalley to impose a high duty on luxuries. </para>

Having regard to the fact that we have just imposed duties of 30 or 40 per cent. on some of the necessaries of life, I cannot work up any enthusiasm regarding a proposal to remove a duty of 15 per cent. on ostrich feathers. I have risen for the purpose of asking the Treasurer what he proposes to do regarding the preference to South Africa in respect of ostrich feathers ? Unless something be done we shall have to reduce the operation of the duty as against South Africa. </para>

I am sorry to learn that the honorable member for Dalley would increase this duty, since I think that there is no virtue in taxing the people to a greater extent than is necessary for revenue purposes. At the same time, I recognise that the honorable member made a good point when he said that although wearing apparel, required by the poorest section of the community, had been taxed to the extent of 40 per cent. - and I believe that that duty was imposed upon the recommendation of the honorable member for Corangamite - that honorable member now desires that ostrich feathers should be placed on the free list. </para>

That preference when given overruled the then existing Tariff, as it was a later enactment of the Parliament, but the Bill which will give effect to this Tariff will also be a new enactment, and will probably repeal by implication, so far as Australia is concerned, the arrangement made with South Africa. The Treasurer should see that a clause is introduced into the Bill to preserve the rights of South Africa under the existing arrangement. </para>

                            <para>. - There is a special Act containing the preference to South Africa. I am not a legal luminary, but the Customs Department hold that that Act must be specially repealed before this Tariff can interfere with it. It will hold good and the duties will be collected without regard to the rates fixed for the item under consideration. </para>

                            <para>. - It is worth the Treasurer's while to look into the question of the South African preference. He did not seem to know - I do not blame him for it, because it is not his duty to become what he calls " a legal luminary " - whether the Act dealing with that preference will apply to Tariff Acts passed subsequent to it. It is quite possible that it provides that whatever Tariff may be passed there shall be a preference, but if it refers to an item the rates on which are different in the United Kingdom and General Tariff columns, how will the South African preference apply? Will the preference be a reduction from the duty as against Great Britain, or a reduction from the duty as against the rest of the world? </para>

                            <para>.- I intend to vote for the amendment. It is true that the duties have been increased on articles of necessity used by the poorer classes, but that has not been the fault of free-traders like myself. If we had our way we would reduce the duties very much below anything that has been proposed even from this side. If reductions on a lower scale have not been proposed, it has only been because of the certainty that we could not carry them, and because of our desire not to waste time in useless efforts. Those duties upon the necessaries of life and the clothing of the masses of the people have been imposed in spite of all our efforts as free-traders to have them reduced, and, I am sorry to say, mainly with the assistance of those who claim directly to represent the working classes. That, however, is no fault of ours. It is certainly no fault of mine, because I have done  my  best to persuade the Committee to reduce the duties considerably. The fact that I have not been successful does not justify me in refusing to try to obtain the reduction of duties on other articles. Whenever I see an opportunity to vote for a reduction of duty, or to free some of the more common articles of daily necessity from duty altogether, I shall do so. Therefore, to be consistent with my principles, I propose to vote for the amendment. </para>

                                <para>- Under the old Tariff the duty was  15  per cent. on the raw material and  25  per cent. on the made-up article. Under the new Tariff, presuming we get our feathers from South Africa, there will be a preference of  5  per cent. in favour of that country. What I desire to say. is that ostrich feathers represent another South Australian industry. There are two or three large ostrich farms in South Australia, but the industry does not seem to  have been considered when the agreement was made with South Africa.. </para>

The only competition comes from South Africa, and there is a preference of 10 per cent, in favour of that country. That, of course, reduces the protection to 5 per cent. </para>

                            <para>-- On this important question I have been more or less misled. I find that a lot of ostriches have been hatched quite recently, and trouble has been falling thick and fast about my head. The only honorable member I have to support me is the honorable member for Lang. The honorable member for Grey, who has been very consistent in his desire to lower duties, feels that on this item he must vote with the Government. I cannot understand why the honorable member for Fawkner, and those interested in the industry, desire to have this duty removed, because, as we are often told by honorable members opposite, ' a duty always lowers the price of an article. Under the circumstances, in the interest of the manufacturer himself, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment. </para>

                            <para>. - I direct the attention of the Treasurer to a rather important point which arises when we compare the Tariff before us with the Customs Tariff Act, which gave a preference to South Africa. Under that Act it is provided that the rate of duty shall be  15  per cent., with a 5 per cent, preference to South Africa. </para>

                                <para>- Under the proposals with which we are dealing, both the general Tariff and the Tariff for the United Kingdom is 15 per cent. If the Act bears the same relation to the Tariff we are now considering, as it bears to the Tariff of 1902, it means that we are giving South Africa a preference of 5 per cent, over Great Britain. I do not think that that is the intention of the Government. </para>

                                <para>- According to the Customs Tariff Act, there is a duty of 15 per cent, on undressed -feathers, but the duty in the case of feathers from South Africa is only 10 per cent., whereas the Tariff now before us places both British and foreign feathers at 15 per cent. If the.  Customs Tariff Act hold good, South Africa will still have an advantage of 5 per cent, over Great Britain. We must remember that this item: is not confined to ostrich feathers, but extends to feathers of all kinds; and any feathers from Great Britain will have to pay a duty of 15 per cent. </para>

                                <para>- I have chiefly in mind such articles as bedding, quilts, and gowns. I would point out that while it is proposed to charge 30 per cent. upon dressed feathers, cosies, which are made up from these very feathers, will, under item 118, be admitted at 25 per cent. and 20 per cent. In other words, the raw material for the manufacture of cosies will be charged 30 per cent. I maintain that the raw material should not be dutiable at a heavier rate than the manufactured article. If honorable members will turn to item 118 they will see that cosies and cushions in part or wholly made up are subject to a duty of 25 per cent. under the. General Tariff, and of 20 per cent. under the Tariff for the United Kingdom. Consequently, if these articles are made in England, they will be admitted for 10 per cent. less than will the raw material. I therefore suggest the addition of the words " feathers and downs other than for adornment." </para>

                        <para>Colonel FOXTON.- I take it that as it is used the word refers to woven sashes and collars. If those articles are to be made free, why should not aprons be included in the item? I do not understand why any of them should- be made free. We are imposing very high duties on that clothing which is a necessity of every-day life. I regard articles of regalia as luxuries, more or less. A man who can afford to belong to a society whose members wear regalia must be in a position to pay a duty thereon equally with the man who has to pay a duty on the coat which he wears. I suggest to the Treasurer that he should impose a duty on articles of regalia, which can be manufactured in Australia as well as they can be made in any other country. A firm in Brisbane which has laid itself out to manufacture regalia of all kinds, even of the most elaborate character, has forwarded to me a specimen which I have within the building, and which has been seen by honorable members. One has only to go up to the Women's Work Exhibition to see as fine embroidery of this character as can be produced in any part of the world. </para>

When the honorable member for Gwydir proposed to levy a duty on iron he was ruled out of order by the  Chairman,  because iron was not mentioned in the schedule. </para>

I do not know whether the honorable member for Parramatta desires me to go through the various authorities I quoted on the last occasion. I still hold that it is only competent for a Minister of the Crown to move to increase a duty. If the Committee were to negative this item it would be practically increasing taxation ; but I have no power with reference to that. For a private member, however, to move that a duty be increased would be distinctly out of order. </para>

As I understand your ruling, you hold that a Minister of the Crown can move to increase a duty, but that a private member cannot. May I submit to you that the power of a Minister of the Crown in that respect does not arise from his being a Minister of the Crown, nor has he additional rights beyond those possessed by a private member. He simply acts under a GovernorGeneral's message, which, must be brought down preliminarily. If you admit, sir, that a Minister of the Crown can move to increase a duty without a GovernorGeneral's message, then I, as an ordinary member of this House, have equal rights. </para>

I forget what the item under discussion was. So far as I recollect, the amendment moved was similar to that which is now being moved. I wish to inquire whether it is competent for an honorable member to move an amendment which will indirectly have the effect of increasing taxation by putting an item under another heading where the proposed duty is higher. </para>

                            <para>. - I rise to support the item before the Committee for two reasons. In the first place, it is about the only virtue which I can see in this Tariff. It affords one consolation for the poor, namely, that if they cannot afford to buy any other clothing they will know that sashes and collars are on the free list. Another reason why I support the item is that I am very suspicious of any proposition made by a Queensland representative. Whenever I see one of them supporting something I begin to think that there is something behind it which is not apparent. I am inclined to believe that the honorable member for Brisbane has a collar factory in his electorate. </para>

                            <para>.- There is not much in this item one way or the other. The total quantity of regalia imported in the year, for which I have figures, was valued at only '^377. Those members of the community who are fond of adorning themselves m this way are well able to pay for their regalia. It is no hardship upon some worthy Grand Master of the Mudbucket, or something of that kind, to compel him to pay a good price for his  regalia. The Minister will be well advised in retaining the item as it stands. The honorable member for Grey is pleased that regalia is to be free, but he has not said a word about the aprons which are dutiable under another item. </para>

I do not see why any exception should be taken to the addition of the words I propose, seeing that the total value of the imports under this item for 1906 amounted to only £377, and the total value of clergymen's vestments and bannerettes imported must be very small indeed. </para>

                                <para>- I understand that jute bags are admitted free under item 114; but it seems to me that it might be well to put a small duty on them, to obtain their better inspection. Many of the bags which now come from Calcutta are practically worthless, as they will bear only one filling. </para>

                                <para>- In my opinion, the departmental inspection is not sufficient. I have been in correspondence with the Department on the subject for some time, on behalf of the Victorian Producers' Association, and the matter has been dealt with in the commercial columns of the <inline font-style="italic">Age.</inline> A commercial and financial newspaper called <inline font-style="italic">Capital,</inline> published at Calcutta, has also referred to it. That paper, I understand, represents the more respectable traders and manufacturers connected with the Calcutta Chamber of Commerce, and interested in the export of bags. They are desirous that the supervision should be stricter. </para>

                                <para>- It has been argued that a duty on tea would have the effect of securing stricter supervision, and preventing the importation of tea of a bad quality, and the same argument must apply in this case. The Customs officer, seeing that an importation consists of bags, which he knows to be free of duty - many other bags besides jute bags are imported duty free - lets it pass. </para>

                                <para>- This is a matter of great importance to the farmers, and if the Minister informs me that the importation of inferior bags can be prevented without the imposition of a. duty, I shall be satisfied. If not, I think that it would be better for the farmers to pay a duty of  15  per cent. and to get good bags. A large part of a farmer's expenditure goes in providing bags, and he must' have them of good quality. </para>

                            <para>. - This matter was first dealt with by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Allan</inline> McLean, when Minister, but the instructions were not properly carried out until I returned to the Department, and compelled importers to place on the bags, in letters of a certain size, the number of porter and shot, in other words, the strength of the weft and warp. As that is now done, those who buy bags know that certain bags are below the standard, and of poor quality, and if they are content to accept such bags, they must put up with the consequences. It would be rather hard upon the farmers to impose a duty on jute bags, seeing that they are not  manufactured  in the Commonwealth. </para>

Because an industry is a Queens and one an attack must be made upon it.I have yet to learn from those honorable m embers who are constantly prating about other people exhibiting provincialism hat it is justifiable to condemn an industry because it happens to flourish in one particular State. I endeavour to avoid anything of the kind; I try to look at every proposal from a national stand-point. It is scarcely fair to twit an honorable member with being a provincialist merely because he advocates, as every honorable number ought to do, the encouragement of industries in Australia generally, and particularly those in his own constituency.

                            <para>What we ask for is sufficient protection to enable us with white labour to hold our own against competitors in India, working as we do under the restriction imposed by special factory legislation and paying a living wage to our workers. Last year over 10,000,000 bran bags were imported, and if this small amount of protection we ask for was granted the whole of these could be made within the Commonwealth, giving employment to a large number of hands. The duty asked for would not interfere with any export trade, as practically all the bran and chaff bags imported are used within the Commonwealth. We are not asking for a duty on corn and flour sacks, which would still come in duty free ; but, having expended a considerable amount of money in equipping factories suitable for the manufacture of bran and chaff bags, we would respectfully urge our claim for protection. </para>
                            <para>Ore Bags. - The above remarks apply also to ore bags, but in this line we are under a very serious additional disadvantage, in that while the ore bags are admitted duty free the material from which they are made (jute niece goods) is, dutiable at the rate of 10 per cent. </para>

Bran and chaff bags are not made here in anything like sufficient quantities to meet the large demand, and to impose a duty would be to inflict a direct charge on the farmer. Bags, especially chaff bags, are very dear. </para>

                            <para>.- I am in favour of a light duty on the whole of the commodities embraced within this item. If we except one commodity, 'we ought to except the whole of them. If bran and chaff bags are to be excepted because they are in such large demand, I think a similar reason might be urged for the exception of the manure bags, seeing that without manure we might have no chaff or bran. In some countries manure is carried free on the railways for the sake of the revenue returned from the carriage of the harvest. I desire to be a consistent protectionist, and, therefore, I would support a light duty on every commodity which can be manufactured within the Commonwealth. </para>

I do not impute any deliberate intention on the part of the Treasurer, but my proposal was to omit bran and chaff bags, and bags for ore, salt, gypsum, and manure. The Treasurer agreed to accept my amendment, excepting only bran and chaff bags, and we voted for them on that understanding. </para>

                            The only point urged by the Treasurer was that the demand for bran and chaff bags could not be overtaken by the local supply, and that, therefore, importations must continue. In regard to the other classes of bags, that argument does not apply, because it is perfectly certain that they can be manufactured here. I was surprised to hear the Treasurer say, " Hear, hear" to the suggestion of the honorable member for Darling that the duty on all bags would increase the price.

                            <para>. - I could understand the honorable member for Brisbane moving the omission of sugar mats, but certainly not the omission of ore bags. The latter are used by men who do not get anything like the protection which is enjoyed by those engaged in the sugar industry. A great number of ore bags are used, not by large companies, but by poor prospecting miners in the back-blocks, who have to cart their ore, sometimes long distances, to the nearest railway station. </para>

                                <para>- It is not a reason why it should be supported. The facts are all against the amendment of the honorable member for Brisbane. I protest against the Government giving way upon these articles whilst resisting the imposition of a tax upon bags which are used in other industries. I am surprised that the honorable member for Brisbane did not include sugar bags in his proposal. As the Government have given way upon the matter it is idle to do anything more to protest against their action. I certainly do object to singling out the industries of one State - as the industries of Queensland have been singled out during the whole of the Tariff discussion - for special treatment. </para>

If the Minister would agree to include sugar mats in the amendment, I think that the item, as so amended, would be agreed to. In my opinion, all these bags should come in duty free, but if we are to have a duty on salt, gypsum, and manure bags, then sugar mats ought to be made dutiable too. </para>

                            <para>.- I hope that die Government will stick "to their guns. The only help which we can give to a number of primary industries is by allowing their bags to be obtained as cheaply as possible. I do not think that a case has been made out for the omission of salt, gypsum, and manure bags from this item. What have 'we heard? The honorable member for Brisbane read .a letter from: a firm of bagmakers, and thereupon the Treasurer weakly gave way to him. I think it is time to report progress when the reading of a letter of that character has the effect of inducing the Minister to change his mind regarding any articles. </para>

Some honorable members have stated that these bags were all duty free before, but that was not the case. The salt manufacturers have obtained a duty which is equal to a protection of 50 per cent., but they  object to the bagmakers getting a duty which would be equal to' a protection of about 5 per cent. I hope that the Minister will adhere to his promise to make salt, gypsum, and manure bags dutiable, as they were before. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member for Boothby was absent at the time, and when he returned he thought that the request had emanated from the other side of the chamber, and he was disinclined to accept our assurance that originally it came from some honorable members on this side. It has been stated that these bags are not made out of calico. My information shows clearly that calico bags are made by the thousand for carrying salt, gypsum, and even manure. </para>
