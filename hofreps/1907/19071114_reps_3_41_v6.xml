                        <para>- Is the Minister of Defence aware that although new guns have been provided for the Field Artillery in Victoria it was found impossible on the King&#39;s birthday - and. this has been the position for several months - to use them owing to the want of a range long enough to fire over. Has the Department made any arrangements for the selection of a suitable range on the Nepean Peninsula, or some more suitable site?. </para>

                        <para>- The question is a very important one, and there is some difficulty in dealing with it, since the area required must be large, fairly accessible, and obtainable at a reasonable price. Action is being taken in regard to the acquisition of ranges not only in Victoria but in all the States, and I hope to be able in the near future to give some information to the House in regard to the matter. </para>

                            <para>Has his attention been called to thePeak <inline font-style="italic">Hill Express,</inline> New South Wales, of the 8th instant, in which . the following statement appeals :  - &#34; We lodged two telegraphic messages at the Peak Hill office on Monday afternoon. Although the local officials waited at the instruments till after 11 o&#39;clock that night, they found it impossible to get the messages away, the reason being assigned to the congested state of the telegraph lines, and it was not until the next day that the messages were despatched. On the payment of &#39; urgent &#39; rates, however, the sender of a message can nearly depend upon getting his telegram ticked to its destination, but why should the public be compelled to pay double charges for ordinary messages? It looks to us as if the present deplorable state of affairs in our telegraph offices is created by a desire on the part of those concerned to compel  the public to pay double rates as often as possible, thus assisting to swell the yearly surplus unjustly wrung from a long-suffering people. The fault does not lie with the country operators, but with the system which has brought the - Commonwealth Telegraphic Service into ridicule and contempt.&#34; Also in another paragraph in the same issue, it is stated - &#34; On Monday afternoon, a telegram was lodged, in Melbourne for despatch to the proprietor of this paper. We received the wire at 7.35 on Tuesday night, after it had been sent in error to Peak Hill, Western Australia, or 26 hours after the message was lodged. On Tuesday, at 11 a.m., we lodged a wire for despatch to Manildra, and at 3 o&#39;clock that afternoon we were informed that, although lying at the local office for <inline font-style="italic">four hours,</inline> the operator could not get it away, owing to the congested state of the line. We agreed to pay <inline font-style="italic">double rates,</inline> and the wire was sent on its delayed journey. Race telegrams lodged in Sydney for the <inline font-style="italic">Express</inline> at 3.35 p.m. on Tuesday did not reach us till 7.30 p.m. that night. Is it any wonder that the whole countryside is clamouring for reform in our Electric Telegraph Department &#34; ? </para>

                    <para>I may say at once that I do not think it will be necessary for me to deal with all the details of this Bill, since a similar measure has already engaged the attention of the House on three different occasions, and the debates in respect of it are recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> In 1902, a Bill providing for the payment of a bonus upon the production of iron was introduced by the right honorable member for Adelaide, after the matter had been inquired into by a Royal Commission. As is well known, the measure did. not become law. A majority of honorable members in that Parliament were averse to the granting of bounties. </para>

                            <para>- The Bill which was introduced by the right honorable member for Adelaide did not become law, because at that time a majority of honorable members were opposed to the granting of bonuses for the purpose of fostering the iron industry. Upon 22nd March, 1904, I brought forward another measure having a similar object in view. That did not meet with the favorable reception which I had anticipated, and consequently it was not passed into law. Again, in 1905, a Bill of a similar character was submitted, with a like result. I am now proposing the second reading of a measure which, though not identical with its predecessors, contains very similar provisions to those which were embodied in them. I have brought it forward because the Tariff has been so arranged that if it does not receive the approval of honorable members we shall then be in a position to deal with the question of iron and steel in another way. I am very strongly in favour of fostering the iron industry by means of bounties, because I hold that . if a duty&#39; be imposed upon iron - and that is the only alternative presented to us - it will be, to some extent,, a tax upon the raw material used in many of our manufactures. In Division VIa; of the Tariff, we propose to grant to manufacturers an increased protection of <inline font-style="italic">z\</inline> or 3 per cent, in consequence of the imposition of duties upon pig iron, and a variety of other products to which I shall presently refer. </para>

                            <para>- Of course I am not administering any rule which I myself have laid down. I am merely administering the Standing Orders, which preclude reference being made, in a debate upon one measure, to a debate upon another measure. If the Treasurer intends to refer in detail to the Tariff proposals, I cannot possibly allow him to do that. But I would point out that he will be able to accomplish his&#39; object by emphasizing the advantage of adopting the bounty method of encouraging the iron industry without discussing the exact rates of duty set out in the Tariff schedule. </para>

Division VIa. coming into force will be to place a duty (taking an example) upon 229 (c) bar and angle iron, sheet iron, &#38;c, of <inline font-style="italic">12&#189;</inline> per cent. The duty on corrugated galvanized iron under Division VI. is 20 per cent, and 25 per cent. Till VIa. comes into operation sheet iron is free, and, consequently, the maker of galvanized iron has the whole of his duty (20 per cent, and 25 per cent. by way of protection. The duty on the sheet used under VIa. is 12&#189; per cent. and when that division comes into force the protection now given would be reduced to the extent of the duty paid on the raw material, and the margin in favour of the manufacturer reduced to that extent. </para>

                        <para>To counteract this it is intended so soon as VIA. comes into force that VIb. shall follow and increase the import duty on galvanized iron by 5 per cent, <inline font-style="italic">(i.e.,</inline> to 25 per cent, and 30 per cent.). This 5 per cent, is about equal to the additional cost to the manufacturer of the duty on his raw material. If this were not done the effect might be that manufacturers would be entirely in the hands of the maker of the sheet from who might not be able to supply, or might  demand too much for the price of his article. If he did so then the manufacturer would be enabled to use imported sheet on which import duty has been paid, and would be in no worse position tha-n he was before. </para>

                            <para>- But in Division VI. there are very few items which will be seriously affected. It was at the instance of members of the Committee of Ways and Means that  I  promised, within the past ten days, to bring forward this measure before Division  VIa.  of the Tariff had been dealt with, because its provisions may affect some of the duties specified therein. As we have dealt with this question upon at least three previous occasions,  I  do not intend to make a long speech upon it. As a matter of fact,  I  am not quite sure that still another Bill relating to it . was not passed by this House and transmitted to the Senate last year, where it was defeated by,  I  believe, one vote.  I  regard the iron industry as representing the foundation of the prosperity of the manufactures of Australia. Not only in one State, but in several, there are abundant deposits of iron ore.  I  have visited some of those places, and, in my opinion, the best ore is to be found at Blythe River, in Tasmania. That ore has been tested thoroughly ; and  I  understand that a drive has been put in for about 600 feet. A small shipment was sent to England, not to be assayed, but to be dealt with in the ordinary way ; and the result was within 1 per cent, of the result from ore obtained from the richest mine in the world, in Norway. All this ore at the present time is lying idle ; and the Tariff proposals are, as the honorable member for Dalley has said, double-barrelled. The first barrel is represented by this Bill, and the second barrel is . represented by the duties which we propose if the Bill is not carried into effect. </para>

                    <para class="block">Australia, then the price of the raw material is increased to manufacturers in the meantime. But for this fact, it would be by far the easier method to impose a duty. In every country in the world, where the iron and steel industry has become prominent - such as Canada and the United States, and, in earlier days, Great Britain - a bounty has been the first step towards development. I am merely proposing what Has been proposed three times before, namely, a bounty without a duty in the first instance, but with a provision that, when there is sufficient production, not only from one mill, but, perhaps, from a dozen, to prevent any great rise in prices, we may be relieved from the necessity of paying a bounty, and may impose a duty. That is the whole theory of the proposal now laid before honorable members. I should like to&#39; refer to the great imports of not only pig iron and bar iron, but iron manufactures as a whole. This matter has been referred to on previous occasions, and figures relating to the matter may be found recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> The average imports of iron and steel, unmanufactured and manufactured, into Australia represent about &#163;7,000,000 a year. I have here the latest return, which I have pleasure in laying before honorable members - </para>

                            <para>- Yes; and this is the largest importation we have had for some- time, the average being, as I have already said, about &#163;7,000,000. I give the details in order that the magnitude of this industry may be realized by honorable members. I regret that the iron industry, which has been started in New South Wales, and has been assisted by the Government of that State, does not promise to be successful. This is not because the best class of iron is not produced there. It has been proved that the iron manufactured in New South Wales is better than English iron, and is as good as Scotch iron. The reason is to be found in the fact that an industry of the character cannot be started without immense capital. </para>

                            <para>- Men whom I have urged to embark capital in this industry have told me that they are afraid of the American Steel Trust. We should do all we can to foster this industry in the interest of local manufactures, the increased production of wealth, and the defence of Australia, which is, perhaps, the strongest reason of all. When Premier of New South Wales, at the time of the South African war, I applied for 5,000 or 10,000 rifles; but every arsenal was at  the time in full work, and the British Government replied that the rifles could not be supplied, and not one was obtained until some time after the war had finished. We should not, in war time, be unable to arm ourselves. We have the raw material for the manufacture of iron, and it will be a serious thing for us in the future if we cannot make our own arms. The Go-: ernment intend, within a few days, to make a proposal for the establishment of a small-arms factory, and I hope that later on we shall be able to make more than small arms. My honorable colleagues and myself wish to have something to fall back on in the event of this Bill meeting the same fate as similar Bills. </para>

                            <para>- It also provides a means for the transference of interests. The schedule to the Bill is not quite the same as the schedule to the last Bill. For instance, no bounty is provided for the production of spelter, of which a great deal is required in Australia. As was shown when the wire-netting duties were under discussion, the manufacturers of wire-netting require more spelter than they can get in Australia. The honorable member for Kooyong said that plenty of spelter is being obtained from Broken Hill, but I have ascertained that the spelter used is made at Cockle Creek, from Broken Hill ore. In view of the&#39; probable expansion of the business at various places, I do not think that a bounty is necessary to encourage&#39; it. For the production of pig iron made from Australian ore, of puddled bar iron made from Australian pig iron, and of steel made from Australian pig iron, I provide for bounties of 12 s. per ton. The total amount the payment of which may be authorized in connexion with these bounties is &#163;250,000, and the bounties expire on the 1st January, 1913. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. I have been informed that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandford</inline> intended at one time,, if he could obtain sufficient inducement, to put up machinery for the making of wire, and I offer a bountv of 10 per cent, for the encouragement of that industry. A similar bounty will be given for the production of iron and steel tubes or pipes which are not riveted or cast, nor more than four inches in internal diameter. The bounties on galvanized iron, wire-netting and wire, and iron and steel tubes or pipes, will expire in 191 1, and must not exceed &#163;50,000, so that the annual expenditure will not be very large. I also offer a bounty of  &#163;8  each for the first 500 reapers and binders produced in Australia. I had intended to omit that bounty, being under the impression that these machines are manufactured here: but I learned this morning that they are not. </para>

I think that I have explained, in a plain, straightforward way, the chief provisions of this Bill, and the reasons for its introduction at the present stage. I do not wish it to cut into the track of our consideration of the Tariff, but desire that a test vote upon it shall be taken, so that I may know what is the opinion of the House in regard to it.  1  certainly favour the bounty system, but it this Bill be rejected I shall not waver in my efforts to encourage the industry. In the event of such a contingency, I shall fall back upon the provisions of the Tariff. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member refers to the provisions of Division  VIa.  of the Tariff. At &#39;the head of that division there is a. paragraph intimating that it is to come into operation on dates to be fixed by proclamation, the proclamation to issue as soon as it is certified that the manufacture to which it relates&#39; has been sufficiently established in the Commonwealth. Until then it will be &#39; latent and the provisions of this&#39;.Bill will operate. In that way we shall encourage the industry without imposing any duty on the raw material of those who use iron until it has been established. But as soon as the Minister or the Executive certifies that the industry has been sufficiently established in Australia these bounties will cease, and the duties under Division Via. will come into operation. </para>

                            <para>- No. I may say that part of this Bill was originally drafted by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. -</inline> now <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> - Isaacs, and that it left his hands, it contained a provision somewhat approaching what is now known as the new protection. &#39; That provision, however, was not in itself complete, as compared with the new protection proposals which we now have under consideration. I, therefore, eliminated it, determining that if the Bill were carried the one general policy of the new protection should apply., to the industries to which it relates as well as to others. I thought it desirable to make* a passing reference to that matter-, in order that honorable members should know what are the intentions of the Government in regard to the wages and conditions of labour of the men engaged in the industry. I consulted the Prime Minister about the matter, and I thought it was better to bring this industry under the general policy of the new protection rather than to insert in the Bill provisions relating specially to it. If we sought in this Bill to deal with the wages of employes and conditions of labour in the industry, we should thus create two different classes of cases to be adjudicated upon. Honorable members will recognise that it is far better to make provision in a general Bill for the policy of the new protection to be applied to this and other industries. </para>

                            <para>- I am confident that it will not hold our legislation in regard to the new protection to be unconstitutional. I have heard some honorable members express a contrary view, but the Prime Minister and a good many other lawyers have no fear in that regard. I&#39; think that the spirit, of the Constitution will be observed. </para>

                    <para>. - The Minister has substituted for the old <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty a fixed duty, so that guns costing &#163;60 or &#163;80 will be liable to the same duty as a cheap gun put perhaps to a more useful purpose, such as the destruction of vermin.

                        <para>- We could have a minimum&#39; rate fixed. Personally I should prefer <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties such as the old rates of io per cent, and 15 per cent. The proposed change in the rates will not seriously affect the revenue, but it is rather unjust that cheap guns should be called upon to bear as high a duty as are the most expensive varieties. </para>

                        <para>- Then they were interested in repairs. Further, they wished to import gun stocks for the purpose of putting guns together in the Commonwealth. The old rates of duty were very low. Ten per cent, was imposed upon guns, revolvers were dutiable at 15 per cent., and military and match rifles were admitted free. The object of levying these fixed duties is to limit the importation of cheap rubbish - cheap guns, rifles, and revolvers which have been proved by bitter and disastrous experience to be dangerous to life, and not at all calculated to develop good rifle, gun, or revolver practice. Both these witnesses affirmed that the commonest rubbish in the world was imported into the Commonwealth under the operation of the moderate duty of 10 per cent. It is only fixed duties which are expressly designed to discourage the use of low class guns, rifles, and revolvers that will exclude this rubbish. A 10 per cent, rate will be absolutely ineffective, and a 20 per cent, duty might not be sufficient to keep out revolvers which are worth only 4s. or 5s. These weapons very frequently find their way into the hands of boys, and their use often results in the loss of life or limb. </para>

                        <para>- Therefore we can regard them merely from the stand-point of revenue. I do not object to the imposition of a duty upon this class of imports, but I do object to charging the same rate upon a fowling-piece worth &#163;60 as is levied upon a gun which is worth only &#163;5. I know from experience that one can purchase a gun for &#163;5 which is quite as reliable - so far as immunity from bursting is concerned - as is a much more expensive weapon. I admit that there is a cheaper class of gun - principally of German or Belgian make - which is sold in Australia for about 50s. It is not desirable &#39;to encourage the use of these very cheap weapons. For that reason I am willing to agree to the imposition of a minimum duty ; but I think that we ought also to provide that the really expensive weapon which a man imports merely to please his fancy should bear an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rate in addition to the specific duty. </para>

                    <para>.- In my opinion it is most unfair that a common gun should be called upon to bear the same duty as is a valuable weapon. It is- well known that one cannot purchase a, first-class Purdey gun under about eighty guineas landed here. I do not agree with the honorable member for South Sydney that the use of an expensive gun is prompted by mere fancy. The very best value that can be offered to a man is to be found in a good gun.. Less than three years ago I saw a gun sold for about &#163;6. It was so badly put together that the shot from the right barrel crossed the shot from the left. That defect is easily accounted for in the manufacture of a gun. Some persons imagine that the barrels of a gun are straight. But, as a matter of fact, in a double-barrelled weapon they are crooked. I suggest that a fixed duty should be imposed upon pea rifles, revolvers, &#38;c. In mv judgment, pea rifles are the most dangerous weapons in use in Australia to-day. They carry much further than one would think, and almost daily we read of accidents occurring through their use. </para>

I did not refer to flannelette in any way ; and if the Minister considers there is anything humorous in my remarks he is at liberty to go outside and think about them. I suggest that on all guns up to, say, the value of &#163;3, a fixed duty shall be imposed, with an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty on guns over that value. It is not fair that a farmer or a rabbiter should be asked to pay the same duty on his low-priced gun as is paid by the pigeon shot, who uses high-class fire-arms as a. hobby. </para>

                    <para>.- When speaking in the general Tariff discussion, I expressed the opinion that a duty of 11s. on a cheap double-barrelled gun was too much. Those who live in the back blocks have not many- shillings to spare, and they require guns to rid themselves of rabbits and other pests. For such purposes a gun at 27s. 6d. or 30s. is quite sufficient ; and my own opinion is that there ought to be a duty of 15 and 10 per cent., which would tax the man who prefers to use a weapon at &#163;42. We have heard much about bad guns and accidents which occur ; but most accidents arise from the fact that the people who use the weapons do not understand them, or do not exercise sufficient care.  I may say that only a few weeks ago I was lent a gun, the cost of which was 27s. 6d., and I shot with it as well as I have ever shot with much more expensive weapons. I move - </para>

                    <para>-- 1 have listened with great interest to the debate; and I now understand how it is that I have never been really successful as a shot. The explanation of the honor-, able member for Fremantle shows how it is that I have never been able to hit anything alive. I once shot a bird 100 yards off on the top of a tree, but when it &#34;came down it proved to have been dead for years. On another occasion I nearly shot myself, and on a third occasion I nearly shot my friend. My eye and my aim were right, but I must have had one of those guns to which the honorable member refers ; and I am glad to . have the matter cleared up. I think that the proposal of the honorable member for Bass is The simplest way out of the difficulty. As that honorable member, and also the honorable member for South Sydney, said, a matter of 2s. or 3s. cannot make any difference; and we have no object in imposing a duty of us., which would be a heavy impost in the case of a cheap gun. As the honorable member for Bass has said, the people who use these cheap guns are those whom we do not desire to tax to any extent. </para>

                <para class="block">These prices are subject to a trade discount of 10 per cent., and of 2 per cent, for prompt cash. I have also here two samples of gun barrels given to me by a gun repairer, who is interested neither as an importer nor as a maker. One sample is a portion of an imitation Damascus barrel, and is painted to look like ordinary steel ; and the other sample is a portion of a real Damascus barrel. I repeat that if all the cheap guns could be tested at the Customs House many deaths would be prevented, and the additional cost would not be by any means serious. The gun repairer to whom I have referred gave evidence before the Tariff Commission,- and he showed that the imitation barrel is practically an iron pipe painted, and must be a source of danger. This is not a fiscal question ; and I think it ought to be treated just as we treated the question of the importation of opium, when dealing with the last Tariff, merely regarding it from the point of view of the safety of the public. We ought to impose a duty which will restrict, as far as possible, the importation of dangerous guns. My own opinion is that it would be better to admit the guns absolutely free, and to have them tested, than to impose a duty without requiring any guarantee. There have been accidents in the case of guns used by rifle clubs ;. and we know that the average Australian boy runs great danger when he  buys  a gun for <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> and goes out for a holiday. </para>

                    <para>.- The fact of a barrel being called a &#34; Damascus &#34; has very little to do with the matter, because some of the highest class barrels are steel. I have been shooting with steel -barrel led guns for seventeen or eighteen years without any danger to myself ; and that proves that we must not take too much notice of the samples which have been produced. The portion of the barrel submitted by the honorable member for Yarra as Damascus steel of the highest quality shows evidence of being a portion of a gun that has burst, whereas the other barrel, which is supposed to be rubbish, has not burst. Any  decent gun, at the back of the breech, is stamped with the mark of a test made in England. </para>

                        <para>- My experience is that shooters require examination more than do guns. I can assure honorable members that nine-tenths of the men who go out shooting have no idea of what is a proper charge. If I were shooting with a common gun to-morrow, I would not use the same charge that I would in the case of a high-class gun; and there is very little danger in any gun if it be properly used. I should like to see a fixed duty upon pea rifles, revolvers, and similar weapons, with an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty on ordinary guns. I prefer the old duty, but, on consideration, &#91; shall support the amendment moved by the honorable member for Bass. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that the rates proposed are rather low. An average value for a gun is ^3, on which an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty of 10 per cent, would come to only 6s. It is very much by chance that one gets a good gun at a low figure ; I know that from experience. Some of the cheap guns are really dangerous- It would be a good thing if, as suggested by the honorable member for Yarra, all guns could -be tested ; but that is impossible. </para>

                        <para>- It seems to me that paragraph  d  as it stands imposes specific duties on the two items. There is a considerable trade done in Australia in building sporting guns. The industry is a perfectly legitimate one, and is carried on in other parts of the world by men who are gun-builders rather than gun-makers. The barrels are prepared and the stocks are roughed out, and the parts are finished off and put together by the gun-builder. A man who can afford it finds it advantageous to have a gun built to suit his own particular physique, and I do not think that the Committee for the sake of securing an insignificant amount of revenue should do anything to interfere with the industry. </para>

                    <para>.- We have already dealt with double and single barrelled guns, and paragraph  d  relates simply to duplicate parts. It has been said that cheap guns are dangerous. The danger arises not so much from cheapness as from neglect. If every gun had to be tested, we should require an army of inspectors to visit the homesteads where guns are, perhaps, used only once in threw months, and, having been allowed to rust, are loaded and discharged, with the result that accidents often happen. </para>

                    <para>.- The proposal to eliminate arc lights from this item, with a view to their transfer to another item, raises the question of whether it is fair that the electric companies should have their material admitted at low rates of duty, whilst the gas companies are charged very high rates. Under the old Tariff there were certainly a large number of anomalies in this connexion, and I think that the gas companies had good ground for complaining that the electric companies were favoured by reason of a good many of their accessories being admitted free. </para>

                    <para>. - In view of the enormous charges which they exact from their customers, I have not very much sympathy either with the gas companies or with the electric lighting companies. But this item includes &#34; oil and other lamps,&#34; and, consequently, I desire to know whether these articles are produced in the Commonwealth in quantity. Why should we penalize those who use oil lamps - and who are compelled to use them - in order to escape the enormous exactions of these huge monopolies? If incandescent lamps and bulbs are to be taken out of this item, surely similar treatment should be extended to the ordinary lamps. </para>

                    <para>. - I certainly resent the remark of the honorable member, who seemed to imply that I am specially interested in the duty upon hats. I contend that whilst a duty of 30 per cent, may not be protective in its incidence in regard to one industry, it may represent an adequate measure of protection to another industry.  Lampmakers in Victoria affirm that if we grant them a protection of 15 per cent., it will be an adequate protection. I can assure the honorable member for Hindmarsh that we are making lamps in brass, nickel plate, and tin. </para>

                    <para>. - I think we must all congratulate the Post-. master-General upon having at last offered his aid to the Treasurer in the gigantic task which he has undertaken. I am very much obliged to the Postmaster-General for the statement which he has made. I confess that I was not aware that lamps were being made in the Commonwealth, and it is a revelation to me to learn that a duty of  15  per cent, is sufficient to protect an expanding industry. In spite of all the differences between the alleged starvation wages paid in the Mother Country and the wages paid in Australia, it now appears that a duty of  15  per cent, is sufficient to allow our  Australian  artisans to create an expansive industry. I have always heard it contended by Ministers that a  15  per cent, duty was a revenue duty. </para>

                    <para>- The protectionist wing of the Tariff Commission recommended an all-round duty of  15  per cent. ; and, therefore, the present duty means an increase of  75  per cent, on that recommendation.

I merely point out that the protectionist wing of the Commission suggested  15  per cent, as sufficient by way of a general duty. That wing of the Commission took an enormous amount of trouble over these items; and I should. like to hear from the  Chairman,  whether, in his opinion,  15  per cent, is a proper protection. </para>

                        <para>- Then we can help the British manufacturer to the extent of  10  per cent. ; and that, at any rate, is one recommendation of the proposal. But I am afraid that a duty of  25  per cent, will have a tendency to raise prices beyond the extent warranted by protection ; and I agree with the honorable member for Hindmarsh that those who use kerosene lamps are those who have the fewest comforts of life. I should be glad to see this duty made  15  per cent. </para>

                    <para>.- In regard to lamps and lampware, the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission recommended an all-round duty of  15  per cent., thus practically consolidating the old duties of  15  and  20  per cent. This was done on the ground that there were no applications by, or on behalf of, any lamp manufacturer for any increased duty. We therefore decided to adhere to the old duty ; and it certainly could not be suggested that the lamp industry was a strangled one. I believe that most of the lamps and lampware which come into competition with local manufacturers are from the United Kingdom; and, therefore, this proposed preference of 10 per cent, against the foreigner will not be very operative, though it may be operative to some extent. The Tariff Commission had no mandate to consider the question of preference, but I do not see that any harm will be done by giving a light preference against the foreigner; and, therefore, I do not strenuously oppose the proposal. &#39; I have no objection to the proposal to eliminate arc -lamps and -.incandescent lamps from this group. I think,, however, that the attention of the Treasurer might be directed to paragraph 10 of the report of the protectionist section of the Commission, where the whole subject of the conflicting views and interests of gas- companies and electric light companies, with regard to their supplies, is fully taken into consideration. I submit the recommendation which we made to the attention of the Treasurer and his officers. I admit the problem is a difficult one, and that it requires careful and calm consideration. Paragraph 10 of the report is as follows - </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. Legislation ought not to favour one particular group of manufacturers at the expense of another group; and if I had the framing of this Tariff, I should consider what would be a fair all-round duty covering all these articles. The same duties should be operative for gasoliers, brackets, pendants, and so forth, as for incandescent lamps and arc lamps. I do not see why one group should- be free, and the other should be taxed for revenue purposes. Therefore, I consider that arc lamps and incandescent lamps ought to bear duties approximating to those on the other articles I have mentioned. I should like the Treasurer to look at this paragraph and consult his officers as to whether there cannot be a new item covering this cognate group of materials. </para>

                    <para>. - I cannot accept the amendment. I am grouping together the items affecting electric lighting requisites, and am making the rates on such requisites as low as possible, because these things have to be imported. But I should be doing a great injury to the many manufacturers of gas lamps and accessories if I were to reduce these rates. The gas companies are not at a disadvantage, because they can purchase their requisites from Australian manufacturers. </para>

                    <para>. - Undoubtedly, as the Tariff stands, users of gas are at a disadvantage, because, of course, the gas companies will pass on to their customers any duties that may prejudicially affect them, and in many towns it is impossible to get anything but gas light. The honorable member for Nepean is right in saying that we should not differentiate between electric lighting and gas companies. Neither should we differentiate between the users of gas and electric light j and I urge the Minister to treat them alike. If the Tariff is to last for any time - and we all hope that it will - it must be consistent. </para>

We certainly ought not to go beyond those duties, and there should be no distinction between electrical and gas stoves, which are each largely used in order that the heat of wood or coal fires may be avoided. We should endeavour to cheapen these stoves as much as possible, and that being so I am prepared to support the amendment foreshadowed by the honorable member for Corangamite. </para>

                    <para>. - At one time about ten firms were engaged in the gas stove industry in Melbourne, and were doing well. The Metropolitan Gas Company, however, has for some time been supplying most- of the stoves used in the metropolis, and within the last twelve months or two years has imported over  2,000  stoves of a cheap class. The result is that they have practically ruined the gas stove industry in Victoria. I have seen stoves imported by them which are inferior to those of local manufacture. That being so, I hope that the Committee will agree to the duty proposed by the Government so that the industry may again be placed in a flourishing condition. We are able to make a first-class stove at a reasonable price, but the local production has been run off the market by the importation of cheap stoves. </para>

                        <para>- When I intimated that X would support the Government proposal, I believed that I was supporting a duty of  25  per cent, under the General Tariff, and of  15  per cent, under the Tariff for the United Kingdom. From my own experience, I can say that if there is one necessity to which we might extend special consideration this is it. By doing so we shall give to the housewives of Australia cheaper appliances &#39;for cooking purposes, and this will be of great advantage in the hotter portions of the Continent. Iri my opinion, the Government might reasonably consider the &#91;propriety of reducing the rate of duty proposed upon the manufactures of Great Britain by  5  per cent. They would thus be rendering a service to the. housewives of the Commonwealth, without prejudicing the position of any worker. </para>

A Melbourne brass-worker stated that electric radiators were dutiable at  12 <inline font-style="italic">\</inline> per cent, as electrical appliances, while hot water radiators were dutiable at  20  per cent, as manufactures of metals. In his opinion both articles were used for heating purposes, and should be subject to the same impost. It was upon that ground that we recommended a duty of  20  per cent. There was no suggestion that a  30  per cent, rate should be levied against the foreigner. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Danks</inline> suggested that a uniform duty should be levied upon this class of manufactures. No preference was recommended, and, therefore, I do not feel justified in voting for the Government proposal. </para>

                        <para>- They are all monopolies, and they ought to be sufficiently patriotic to purchase everything that they possibly can in Australia. There is no doubt that gas stoves can be manufactured locally. As a matter of fact, they have been so manufactured. Let me point to the case of the Adelaide Gas Company by way of illustration. That company scarcely knows what to do with its income, because it is limited in regard to the payment of its dividends. It could afford to pay higher prices for gas. stoves than it would generally be called upon to pay. </para>

                    <para>.- The members of the Tariff Commission were not instructed to frame a Tariff containing provision for the extension of preferential treatment to Great Britain. Consequently, we recommended a Tariff which in our opinion would be an effective one against the world. How can I be expected to vote for an increase in the duty above the standard which was recommended by my colleagues and myself? How can I be expected to vote for an increase of 5 per cent, upon the rate that we recommended, much less an. increase of 10 per cent. ? </para>

                    <para>- I should like to know the reason for the proposed increase in the duty. As a matter of fact, lamp and gas stoves are manufactured here already in large quantities, and the only &#39;effect of an increased duty would be to enable the local manufacturers to increase prices to the consumers. It is absurd to suppose that the manufacturers themselves are going to pay this duty ; I do not think that the most rabid and unreasoning protectionist could believe that that is likely to be the result. If the duty be increased, there will be practically a monopoly given to the local trade. And who are the people who principally use these stoves, and who will have to pay the increased prices? They are the housewives of the middle and poorer classes, especially in the country districts, where there is not the advantage of  gas and electric lighting. &#39; Instead of increasing the burdens of these people, we ought to relieve them, if possible, in the way of reduced prices. It was my original intention to move a reduction of the duties to 12 <inline font-style="italic">\</inline> and 10 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- If that be so, it fortifies my argument in favour- of a reduction of the duty. Australian stoves of various makers have attained a reputation that is worthy of all credit; but the fact merely shows that there is no need for any further protection. Under the old Tariff the duty was 12^ and 15 per cent. ; and the protectionist section <inline font-style="italic">of</inline> the Tariff Commission with every inclination to do so could not see their way clear to recommend a higher duty than  20  per cent., which, in itself, is a substantial increase. Yet in face of this recommendation the Government proposes a further increase of  10  per cent., thus more than doubling- the old duty. I do not think that the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission consisted of protectionists any less ardent than protectionists in this chamber; and we must remember that the former had the advantage of being able to sift all the details of the industry with the assistance of sworn testimony. We may depend that they fully informed themselves before making any recommendation; and I think that protectionists might rely on their decision as fair and reasonable. </para>

                        <para>- That loss of trade must surely be due to defects in management, or the absence of proper appliances. The honorable, member has just said that certain Australian firms produced stoves better than those imported ; and, in face of that fact, it is difficult to understand how there can be a greater demand for an inferior article. </para>

                        <para>- I think the honorable member is mistaken. He may be right so far as one or two isolated cases are concerned, but, speaking generally, I do not think it can be denied that there is a large and profitable trade done locally. If the industry has already been thoroughly established under the old duty, I do not see what more can be expected under an increased duty, beyond a monopoly which, as invariably happens, must result in obsolete methods, lack of enterprise in the direction of improvement, and failure to keep pace with progress in manufacture in other parts of the world which produce under the stimulus of freer competition. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member may be right, but the bigger ones who form combines can buy them out or crush them. I know there would be no hope of carrying an amendment to reduce the duties to  12&#189;  and  10  per cent., and I do not desire to divide the Committee unnecessarily. The next best course for me is to support the reduction which has been moved by the honorable member for Corangamite. </para>

                        <para>- Prices have been going down for years. I understand that the company still holds some patents in Great Britain, though I am not sure about it. The prices charged for mantles here are about Twice as high as those charged in Great Britain. The mantles are not easily imported, because any heavy shock will break them, and large losses are sometimes incurred by breakages in the cases. The local manufacture consists merely of dipping what is known as the stocking, which is made of textile material, and is imported ready for use, into a solution of mineral earths, also prepared in Great Britain, and imported.. The stocking is impregnated by The mixture and allowed to dry, and the fabric having been consumed by the application of a match, what we know as the mantle remains. </para>

                        <para>- The use of mantles undoubtedly reduces the consumption of gas in- proportion to the light obtained, and therefore should be made as general as possible by the cheapening of these articles. I know of no reason for increasing the duty. A duty of 15 per cent, added to the cost of importing - and we have to remember that there are many breakages in connexion with the shipment of these mantles to Australia - ought to be ample protection. I do not know that the industry, such as it is, has not been successfully carried on in Australia; and the only competition which it seems to have to meet is that of the English branch of the .Welsbach Company, which also carries on business in Australia. The one object of imposing this duty, it seems to me, is to enable the price to be increased. Consumers will thus be penalized. The fact that this co-called industry is carried on in Sydney does not affect my view of what is the right course to take. The interests of the consumer are far greater than are the interests of those who dip these stockings in the fluid to which I have referred. The industry is so trifling that it would be idle to endeavour in this way to encourage it at the cost of- all consumers of gas. </para>

                    <para>.- I rise to point out the invidious distinction made between the electric light companies and consumers of gas. These mantles correspond with the carbons used by the electric light companies, which are dutiable at 5 per cent, when brought from foreign countries, and are free if imported from Great Britain. On the other hand, the Government propose duties of 40 per cent, and 30 per cent, on mantles. That is a very unfair handicap to impose upon the gas as opposed to the electric light companies. </para>

                    <para>.- I have not the slightest interest in or sympathy with the big gas companies, but I would point out that this item affects not the gas companies, but the householders who use the gas, and to whom these mantles mean a practical economy in their household expenditure. Who could say that the industry just described by the honorable . member for North Sydney is one of the kind which honorable members wish to make desperate efforts to establish? The protectionist wing of the Tariff Commission recommended the continuance of the old duty of 15 per cent., and I do not suppose that that recommendation was lightly made. There can be no object in making such an enormous increase in the duty, because the industry in itself cannot employ very much labour. It. it, practically of the most primitive description. The honorable member for South Sydney said very forcibly and frankly yesterday that a large number of these duties would be a burden upon the people. That being so,&#39; we have in this case an opportunity to extend some little consideration to the people without damaging -an industry of any great consequence. The industry will not be injured by the reduction of the duty to 15. per cent., because the protectionist section of the Commission seemed to think that such a duty would fairly protect it. In the circumstances the increase of duty proposed by the Government seems to be without justification. </para>

                <quote>
                    <para>The fact that while carbons are on the free list, gas mantles (which it had been said practically fulfil the same purpose) are dutiable at 15 per cent., is not considered an anomaly. It might be considered that mantles were made dutiable for protective reasons, as they can be easily made in Australia, whereas&#39; carbons are not locally manufactured. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">No evidence was submitted in favour of either an increase or a reduction of the duty on incandescent mantles.&#39; All that was asked for was an equalization of the duties upon gas and electrical materials and implements. &#39; In these circumstances we did not feel called upon to recommend any increase. If it be considered desirable that there should be an increase in the old duty, with a view of giving preference to British goods, I would suggest that the duty on foreign imports should be&#39; 25 per cent., and that the preference to Great Britain should not exceed 10 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- It is not. The Treasurer has the unblushing audacity to maintain that one-half of the Commission represents the main section, when, as a matter of fact, there was an equal number of protectionists and free-traders. Taking his own view of the matter, I might with equal right say that what from my point of view was the main section of the Commission recommended that the duty should be 5 per cent. </para>

All the lead that is necessary at the local manufactories is easily obtainable in Australia, and the importations, which &#39;are comparatively trifling, are to meet special requirements.

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Kooyong was good enough to say that I knew nothing about this matter. As a matter of fact, I have taken some interest in it, and I say without hesitation that the Broken&#39; Hill Proprietary Company has not treated at least one manufacturer in this city very fairly. That company is sending lead to England, where it is selling it at a lower price than it will accept locally. I have been informed that if the company would only reduce its price for lead bullion by 1 os. per ton, this manufacturer would be able to compete with the world. But the company refuse to make even that little concession to him. </para>

                        <para>- I have quoted the evidence of the witnesses who appeared before the Commission. The following is a statement from the Trade and Customs returns for  1905  (page  338)  of the imports of sheet lead and piping into the Commonwealth from oversea during five years :  -  1901, 3.657  cwt., valued at <inline font-style="italic">&#163;4,353;1902,</inline> 8,300  cwt., valued at  &#163;6,717; 1903, 8,395  Cwt, valued at  &#163;6,505; 19045,347  cwt., valued at  &#163;4,128;  and  1905, 5,071  cwt., valued at  &#163;4,127.  Honorable members are probably aware that there is a large export trade  in  this material from the Commonwealth. I find from the Trade and Customs returns, for  1905,  page  343,  that in  1901  we exported  22,611  cwt, valued at  &#163;17,571;  in&#39;  1902, 17,429  cwt., valued at  , &#163;12,147; in 1903, 28,783  cwt., valued at  &#163;22,304.; in 1904, 20,552  cwt., valued at  , &#163;16,116;  and in  1905, 34,629  cwt., valued at <inline font-style="italic">&#163;29,643.</inline> Surely these facts speak for themselves,- and fully justify my statement that the Treasurer&#39;s proposal is utterly unjustifiable in its character.  <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. FRAZER</inline> (Kalgoorlie)  &#91;8.36&#93;.-  The figures quoted by the honorable member for Perth have demonstrated that for years past the importations of this material have been very small. According to official statistics, they amounted last year to only  196  tons. </para>

                        <para>-  I am not at all sure that it will not. The history of every monopoly  in  Australia is that it increases the price of the article which it produces up &#34;to the point at which it can just undersell the imported article. Where is the necessity for imposing such an enormous duty as  50s.  per ton? Personally, I feel disposed to support placing the item upon the free list. </para>

If so, the duty must be added to that cost, and, consequently, the impost will go to those who are producing the lead here and not to the makers of pipes. </para>

                        <para>- If the producers of lead - which is the raw material of the manufacturer- fix their price here- according to the cost of bringing the article into. Australia from abroad, it is evident that the imposition of a duty of  &#163;2 10s.  per ton -would- increase that cost to the manufacturer without extending any protection to the industry. If, on the other hand, the price is fixed, by the London price, less the cost of sending the product there, the position is entirely different, and the manufacturer might receive a benefit by the imposition of such a duty. </para>

                    <para>.- The local consumption of lead is so small that the Broken Hill Proprietary Company is not concerned whether a duty is imposed upon that article. The Broken Efilf Company produces about  70,000  tons of lead annually, and the local consumption is only about&#39;  3,000  tons or  5,000  tons. If the honorable member for Kalgoorlie imagines that the companies are in the least degree concerned in the question of whether or not a duty be imposed upon this article, he is very much mistaken: If the manufacturer needs a protection of  50s.  per ton, by all means let him have it. My own feeling is that Messrs.. Mcllwraith and Company, and other manufacturers, both in Sydney and Melbourne, require some protection, and I should like to see them get it. The price charged for lead by the various Broken Hill companies is the price of the article in London and Japan, where, large quantities of it are sold. </para>

                    <para>.- Under the building laws in South Australia, all bathrooms must have lead floors ; and, notwithstanding the local production, lead for that purpose is now dearer by 50s. than it was before the imposition of the Tariff. No argument has yet been advanced- why this duty should be imposed. Victorian manufacturers asked for a duty of only half the amount ; and my experience is that they are never very modest in their demands, and that if they ask for a dutv of 25s., they will be satisfied with one a great deal less </para>

                        <para>- This does not appear to be an industry which involves any great outlay of capital or much brains ; and I think the duty ought to be considerably reduced. This commodity was free under the old Tariff ; and yet there seemed to be very few imports, showing that the local manufacturers must have pretty well captured the market. </para>

                    <para>.- I at first understood the honorable member for Kooyong to say that lead is sold to buyers here at the price received in London, less shipping charges and so forth ; but, from his later remarks, the impression I received was quite different. The honorable member said then that he understood this lead to be sold to local buyers at a little less than the price for which it could be obtained from elsewhere. If that be a correct &#34; statement, it means, I suppose, that lead is sold to local buyers at, perhaps, a shilling less than the price at which it could be imported from London. That. is hardly a fair way of treating the industries of Australia. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that honorable members who support this duty cannot have read the evidence given before the Tariff . Commission, or they would have seen that no manufacturers asked for anything like the proposed duty. This form of lead is used most extensively in building; and the duty will mean increasing the cost to those working men, amongst others, who desire to get out of the clutches of the landlord by building their own homes. Every endeavour of the kind on the part of the  people ought to be encouraged. Recently I had occasion to obtain estimates for the building of a house, and was just about to sign a contract, when the architect informed me that the price of lead, amongst other items, had increased in consequence of the Tariff. As a - matter of fact, I found that, under the new conditions, the building would cost me nearly  &#163;100  more. Every man who has only his daily wage to depend on tries to acquire a little home of his own; and this Tariff will mean an additional handicap in his struggle to get free. The Treasurer has not shown a single reason why the proposed duty should be imposed. He did tell us that it was recommended by the Tariff Commission ; but he omitted to say that the recommendation was only that of the protectionist section. When we look at the evidence on which that recommendation was made, we find that not a single person interested asked for anything like the proposed duty.

                    <para>A Victorian witness who represented several other manufacturers, suggested that a duty of 10 per cent, should be placed on imports from the United Kingdom, and a duty of 15 per cent, on imports from other countries (Coop, Q.70711 ; Mcllwraith, Q. 70796). An alternative duty was proposed, viz., 25s. per ton on products from the United Kingdom and 30s. per ton against other countries - (Mcllwraith, Q. 70797-98). The New South Wales manufacturers suggested that the dutv on British products should be is. per cwt., and that on manufactures from other countries is. 6d. per cwt. - (Crane, Q.81421). </para>

                    <para>The rate of 25s., it was stated, would entirely prevent the introduction of manufactures of lead into Australia. The extra rate suggested over the protection against Great Britain was, one witness admitted, &#34;merely a sort of ornamental demonstration of the Empire&#39;s unanimity.&#34; </para>

                    <para>.- In my opinion, if we impose a duty the effect  win  be to induce the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, the largest, and, practically, the only producers of lead in Australia, to take advantage of it by manufacturing their lead into sheet lead and lead piping. If they did so, they would soon get rid of all competitors, because the present manufacturers would have to import their raw material. Therefore,  if  the Committee wishes to do a good turn to those engaged in the making of sheet lead and. lead piping, it will allow these ma_&#39; terials to be admitted . duty free. </para>

                <para>Mr.CARR (Macquarie)  &#91;9.5&#93;.  - I indorse the view of the honorable member for Boothby. The position of the company to which he has referred is an instance of the manner in which monopolies grow up as the result of exclusive control of natural opportunity, and are not necessarily the creation of either protection or free-trade. It seems to me that the manufacturers of sheet lead and lead piping have a sufficient natural protection in the cost of importation. We need not fear over-importation, because there is not an over-production of lead. </para>

                    <para>- I hope that the Committee will not be influenced by the suggestion that the wealthy company to which reference has been made will, if the duty be agreed to, commence to manufacture its lead into sheet lead and lead piping, and destroy the business of those who are now manufacturing these articles. The same argument might have been used when we were discussing the duties on woollen piece goods. It might then have been said that their effect would be to induce the Australian woollen mills to commence the business of making up their woollens into clothing, to the detriment Or those now engaged in that business. It  must be borne in mind that, although we have now only one lead mine, others may be discovered in the future. </para>

                        <para>- That remark does not apply to all of them. The importation of cream separators from Great Britain last year was valued at &#163;14,845; and that from other countries at &#163;129,128 ; while other importations from Great Britain were valued at &#163;12,685.and from other countries at &#163;33,389. I am aware that, because of the existence of patent rights, we shall be unable to manufacture many of these implements for a considerable time to come; but in my proposal I am following the recommendation of the B section of the Tariff Commission, so far as the imposition of a duty of 10 per cent, on the foreigner is concerned. It seems to me that we shall do no injury to the butter factories by this impost, and that the item does not clash in any way with the Manufactures Encouragement Bill. </para>

                    <para>.- All the industries to which this item relates have been subjected to additional taxation. Seven or eight of the materials or implements used by butter factories have already been taxed, and those interested in viticulture certainly ought not to be subjected to further taxation. . This item means an additional tax on primary industries, which really contribute to the whole of the work of other industries. - There is no reason why this duty should be imposed. I recognise that the Government desire to grant a preference to British imports, but I fail to see why, in order to achieve that object, we should place the man on the soil, who is already highly taxed, under an additional disability.

                    <para>.- The total value of imports coming under this heading in 1906 was &#163;144,032, and, according to the Treasurer, the value of cream separators - which are included in those figures - was no less than &#163;143,953 only &#163;14,800 worth coming from Great Britain. As a matter of fact, nearly all the cream separators used in Australia come from Sweden, where the industry has been specialized. I read recently that even America was importing 25,000 machines from that country. It is idle to say that by this duty of 10 per cent, we shall do no injury to the dairying industry. Even if the duty on imports from foreign countries were increased we should continue to draw our supplies chiefly from that source. The separators imported from Sweden are so well known that, even if the duty were increased, the demand for them would continue. I support the amendment. </para>

                    <para>.- The Treasurer ought, without further argument, to agree to the amendment. Many of these implements are used in the district which he so ably represents. We have, first of all, cream separators, which are used in all butter factories. Then, again, pasteurizers are absolutely essential to the successful making of butter for export, and milk testers must be used to determine the proportion of butter fat in the milk supplied by dairymen to the factories. Since we have recently agreed to a bounty to encourage the production of cotton in Australia, I fail to see why cotton gins should be dutiable. The same remark will apply to fibre scutching machines. Hand-worked rakes and ploughs combined, hay tedders, horse-rakes, lucerne bunchers, maize harvesters, and maize binders&#39; open up a delightful vista of farm life. Milking machines are absolutely essential to the dairyman. Potato raisers or diggers are made, to some extent, in Australia, a patent having been secured in respect of them. As to sub-surface packers, I would point out that they are essential to the development of the arid districts of Australia, which cannot be properly farmed unless on the American principle of subsurface packing. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl,</inline> when a member of this House, made a most interesting speech with regard to the use of these implements. They are not made here, and I think that the Minister might well give way in regard to this duty. For the most part, these implements and machines are imported from foreign countries. </para>

                    <para>.- The chief reason advanced by the Treasurer for proposing this duty of 10 per cent, was the exceedingly lame one that the Government desired to give a preference to British imports. This, after all, is simply a revenue duty. During the consideration of the Tariff I have supported the Government in regard to all revenue-producing duties that were fair in their incidence. In this case, however, the duty will fall solely upon the farming community, and there is no excuse for it. We undoubtedly hope to make the farmer one of the pillars of our national prosperity. We look to him to build up a sturdy yeomanry, which will be the backbone of the country, and this is a tax for which the least possible excuse can be offered. The farmer has a big fight against climatic difficulties, and has to labour under many other disabilities. The preference proposed to be given to Great Britain in this case cannot be of any effect, for the simple reason that most of the machines covered by the item are patented and of foreign manufacture. </para>

                    <para>.- There seems to be no justification for the imposition of this duty. Taking the first machine mentioned in the item, cream . separators, every one knows that the bulk of those used throughout Australia are of foreign origin. The same remark applies to a very large proportion of the other implements in the item. This duty can be imposed only as a revenue tax; it must fall upon those who are engaged, in primary industries, and for that reason I shall oppose it. By the time that it reaches the consumer, I dare say that, at the very least, it will be equal to an impost of 15 per cent., and that in respect of a machine foi which a man has to pay &#163;30,&#163;40 of . &#163;50, is a serious item. The Prime Minister&#39; said the other day that he was prepared to ask Parliament to find , &#163;200,000 to encourage immigration. Surely we are not going to ask those already on the land to find the money to bring other people here. The poor man, struggling on the soil to obtain a living, should not be asked to put his hand in his pocket for that purpose. I hope that the Treasurer will consent to the item being4 made free. </para>

                    <para>.-I object to this backing and filling on the part of the Treasurer. It is all very well for him to say that he will postpone the consideration of this item, but surely he ought to have devoted some attention to it before the Tariff schedule was submitted. In my judgment, the item ought not to be postponed, because, in the interim, duty is being collected upon the articles specified. We know that cream . separators are a very important factor in the dairying industry, and it is not right that&#39; the money which has been invested in them should be tied up in this way. These separators cannot be made in Australia at the presentmoment. </para>

                        <para>-It is significant that some honorable members who did not baulk at a hurdle of 50 per cent. are greatly concerned about one of 10 per cent. Only last evening, a. section of this Committee was very grieved over the loss of revenue which had been sustained by reason of the reduction of various duties. Here is a chance for them to grieve again. Do I understand that this proposal means a skilful retreat on the part of the Treasurer? </para>

                <para class="block">Under these two items the Treasurer, on the day the Tariff was unfolded, made free of duty hundreds of machine tools and tools of trade used in the different protected &#39;industries of Australia. Amongst these were the tools of tinsmiths, vehicle makers, harness makers, painters, , and many others, and they amount to hundreds of tools. Now, surely the articles mentioned in the item now before us are the tools of trade of the  farmer. Why should those engaged in  those trades which get a substantial benefit from the high protective duties have their tools placed on the free list, while the farmers of Australia, to whom, in the majority of cases, the Tariff is of absolutely no benefit, are heavily taxed on the tools they use? The principle which gives the city artisan and manufacturer tools of trade free ought to extend to the tools employed in the farming industry. In the case of apparel alone, there are some thirty free lines, and this is an industry which enioys protection to the extent of 45 per cent. Then, again, in the case of the boot and shoe industry, there are about fifty free lines, in spite of the enormous protection which is accorded to that industry. I hope the Committee, in dealing with agricultural implements and machinery, will apply the principle of making tools of trade free, always remembering that the farming community get very little substantial benefit out of the Tariff. </para>

These sets are practically tools of trade, and we know what a hard struggle many women have to make a living.

It may be desirable, even if employes do not appear, for him to appoint some one to represent their interests, or to afford him assistance in dealing with their case, and he is, therefore, empowered to appoint an assessor or assessors at any time, even at the last moment, to assist him in framing his award.

                            <para>- Perhaps so. The matter is left to the parties themselves, who will have to bear the . expense. The provision was inserted . by the Senate. Power is given to the  President  to issue an order to any person to take evidence on his behalf. That provision is made with a view to securing elasticity of administration, because it may be desirable to take evidence at some place remote from where -the Court&#39; is sitting. Seeing that these inquiries may often be confidential, no .person taking evidence will be allowed to disclose, except to the  President,  such evidence relating to any trade secret, or to the profits or financial position of any witness or party. The  President  can prohibit the publication of evidence if he thinks fit. </para>

                            <para>- Not at all. In many of these inquiries confidential information which the  President  is entitled to have will be put before him ; but it may not be in the public interest that it should be published. What we aim at is the obtaining of fair and righteous decisions. The powers of the  President  will be the same as those of the  President  of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. He may refer technical matters, or matters of account, to experts, whose reports he can accept as evidence, and he will have power to summon witnesses, to take evidence on oath, and generally to give such directions as he may. deem fit or necessary. Clause 8 is a, copy <inline font-style="italic">ot</inline> a similar provision in the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act, and deals with contempt, while clause 9 provides for the same penalties&#39; for contempt by witnesses as are .provided for in that Act. Any one who disobeys a summons to appear, or refuses to be sworn as a witness, or to answer any question which he is required by the  President  to answer, or to produce any books or documents which he is so required to produce, will be liable to a penalty; but&#39; no person is to be compelled to give evidence, except to the  President,  or&#39; to the person ordered by him to take evidence on his behalf, relating to any trade secret, or to the profits or financial position of any witness or party.&#39;  Such evidence is not to be. disclosed or published without the consent of the person entitled to the trade secret or non-disclosure. Section  10  provides &#39; for the protection of witnesses, making it an offence to use, cause, inflict, or procure under violence, punishment, damage, loss, or disadvantage to an.y one for having appeared as a witness. No employer may dismiss an employe&#34; because he has appeared&#39; as a witness, and. no em- pl&#39;ov-6 shall&#39; cease to work in the service of an employer because of evidence given bv him; In clause  13  penalties are provided for the . intimidation of witnesses, and under clause  15,  where an application is referred by the  President  to a Judge of the Supreme Court of a State, or to a State industrial authority, the Judge or authority&#39; shall have all the powers and privileges vested, in or imposed on the  President.  Clause  16  empowers the Presi-dent to make regulations prescribing practice and procedure on applications; but these are to be subject to the approval of the Governor-General. The Bill deals wholly with procedure, the principles followed being those of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. The  President  is given just, the amount of power necessary to enable him to make the proper investigations required by the Excise Tariff Act. It has been found necessary in the administration of that Act to confer these powers on the Court. </para>
