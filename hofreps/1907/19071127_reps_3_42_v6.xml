                        <para>- I desire to ask the Postmaster-General, without notice&#39;, a question relating to the delivery of Tasmanian mails to the members of this House. I may explain that members of Parliament have at various times encountered great difficulty in getting their letters. Last Saturday week I telephoned down to the General Post Office to inquire why our mails had not been delivered. I telephoned twice, but I did not get my letters until Monday, although they arrived in Melbourne at 9 o&#39;clock on the Saturday morning. To-day, I suppose, the steamer arrived at her usual time - 9 o&#39;clock this morning. I tried to get a telephone message through to the General Post Office, -but could not succeed. The mail has not yet been delivered. I ask now, as I cannot get any % satisfaction . elsewhere - although I telephoned to the  Deputy  Postmaster-General - whether the Postmaster-General will take this matter in hand himself, and see that we, who are members of Parliament, are not placed at a. great disadvantage because we happen&#39; to meet in this place? </para>

I gather that he has received a report from&#39; <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Tidswell</inline> respecting the rabbit extermination experiments in New South Wales. I desire to know whether any representations have been made to him with a view of giving those interested in the result of the experiments, information  as  to the nature of them ? Has the Government come to any decision as to its future attitude regarding the matter?. </para>

I think the honorable member must mean experiments on the mainland. I saw something about the matter in the press, but I have not been approached. As regards future action regarding these experiments of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Danysz,</inline> I . intended to see the Prime Minister this -morning in order to learn what course it was proposed by the Government to take, but was not able to do so. My own feeling is that the experiments ought not to be repented on the mainland. </para>

                            <para>- Arising out of the question asked by the honorable member for Calare, I desire to refer to a previous question asked by myself. It may be remembered that I asked whether inquiries had been made respecting the attempted introduction of a rabbit disease into Australia, and whether the Government would ascertain the name of the New South Wales sheep breeder who had attempted to introduce the disease ? I . may say that I have very , grave doubts whether the gentleman whose name many of us know - has not surreptitiously introduced into Australia a rabbit disease which, if it spread amongst our sheep, might be calamitous. I press the Prime Minister to obtain further particulars if he can. In the meantime, I wish to ask the honorable gentleman whether he will obtain the name of the pastoralist who was on the steamer <inline font-style="italic">Moana,</inline> having with him .the germs of a rabbit disease that he was bringing into Australia, which germs were seized and thrown overboard by a. steward? It is a serious matter to Australia, and I hope that the Minister will cause the most careful inquiries to be made. </para>

The Francotte rifle is used by Cadets in Victoria. The rifle that is used by Cadets in New South Wales is the Westley-Richards. I may also inform the honorable member that the English military authorities have been considering a suitable rifle for Cadets. .We have a sample here,  and it may be&#39; possible for us to adopt it, and so provide a uniform rifle throughout Australia. However, I am not quite sure at present. </para>

                        <para>- With a view to carrying out the policy of. decentralization, a number of duties have been delegated to the  Deputy  Postmasters-General. It has been urged that too much of the work of the Department is concentrated in the central office, and one of  the unfortunate results of our efforts to remove that cause of complaint is that the  Deputy  Postmaster-General at Adelaide has misunderstood the policy of the Commonwealth, as well as his instructions-, and got himself and the State Tender Board into trouble. </para>

                            <para>- I wish to ask the Prime Minister, as a matter of Victorian fiscal history, when there first appeared in the Tariff of this State a provision that a refund of the duty paid on hat-mill machinery should be made as soon as that machinery was established in a factory? As the honorable gentleman is aware, under the new Tariff, machinery for the hat-making industry, has been entirely differentiated from the machinery required for other industries, and I understand that the exemption which appeared in the Tariff of  1902,  as introduced by the right honorable member for Adelaide, was simply a continuation of a Victorian practice. </para>

In this connexion I wish to refer honorable members to a voluntary statement made to the Tariff Commission by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harrington,</inline> of Walker&#39;s, Limited. He was one of the principal witnesses examined in Queensland, and he appeared before the Commission, asking for high protective duties. The only reference to portable engines is in the statement of this witness. Honorable members will find it at page 2188 of the Minutes of Evidence, wherein a duty of 33J per cent, is requested. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harrington,</inline> not on cross-examination, but voluntarily, said - </para>

                <para class="block">The witness came before the Commission asking for protective duties, but he felt, as every honorable member here must feel, that if the duties as proposed by the Treasurer were imposed they would press severely on the agricultural and mining industries so far as traction engines are concerned. He voluntarily suggested that those machines should come in free. In the interests of the agricultural and mining industries &#91; suggest, to the Committee that both traction and portable engines should be put on the free list. Traction engines are used for the carriage of ore in many parts of the Commonwealth. They are not made here. </para>

The Austral Otis Engineering Co. has built several portable engines in sizes up to 12 horse-power. At present, the same company is constructing two heavy earth-scooping traction engines, each of 80 horsepower, and each to cost ^1,200. These machines can be made here, and would form an important addition to the iron trade of the country. </para>

There is the evidence, not of a Victorian, but of a Queensland industry, where it is even more advanced than in Victoria. I have here a letter from the representative of the Austral Otis Company, in which I am informed that at least 200 traction engines will be required in Australia next year, and that at an average price of &#163;800 each they would represent a value of ^160,000, of which it is estimated that ^60,000 would be spent in wages in Australia.

                    <para>. - I support the proposal of the honorable member for Illawarra, to omit traction and portable engines from this item. The Minister has told us that the Austral Otis Company made a traction engine for the Collingwood City Council ; but, I suppose, he means that the company made a steam roller which may be used as a traction engine. Traction engines, properly speaking, are largely used on farms, and are altogether different from such machinery as the famous Coon road roller. If the Collingwood road roller were placed on a farm, it would be bogged for ever, on account of its weight. </para>

Under the old Tariff traction engines and&#39; portable engines were free; and they are used on. every farm in the time of threshing, and also for ploughing, pulling down trees, and so forth.

                        <para>- I feel this item to be one of considerable importance to primary producers from one end of Australia to the other. We must avoid taking a narrow-minded view. We ought not to confine our attention to the interests of Adelaide, Melbourne, and Sydney,- forgetting the men who are developing the resources of the country in the northern parts of Queensland, the back-blocks and the north-west of Western Australia, and in the Northern Territory. The primary producer is always ready to give the manufacturer fair encouragement. In the past manufacturers of some of the items under discussion have enjoyed duties to the extent of 12 <inline font-style="italic">\</inline> per cent., and have&#39; progressed very well under that protection. We are now preparing to give the manufacturer a little more assistance, although that little more is something which cannot be recouped to the producers of butter, grain, and gold. In order that Australia may, as far as possible, be self-contained, we, from patriotic motives, are prepared to extend the protection a little, but that little is as much as we can bear. The honorable member for South Sydney comes here&#39; as a sudden convert from free-trade. </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps it would be more in accordance with tradition if I had said that the Treasurer was depicted in charge of a bullock waggon. I think, upon reflection, that it was a bullock waggon. Upon this waggon were traction and portable engines, and in front of the donkey which represented a certain party, was a bunch of carrots labelled &#34; New protection.&#34; I do riot know what was the condition of the carrots, but I fear that they were not very sound in some respects. As the result of the promise given by the Treasurer, members of the Labour Party are prepared to vote for duties which under other circumstances they would never have dreamed of supporting. Even the honorable member for Maranoa is prepared to vote for almost prohibitive duties. </para>

                    <para>- - During the debate which took place last evening, I made a statement to the effect that the patent rights which attached to Messrs. Babcock and Wilcox&#39;s boilers had expired. I promised to produce the book upon which my information! was based or to apologize to the honorable member for Parramatta. I am happy to say that I have escaped the necessity for offering the apology by producing the information.  From page 12 of Messrs. Babcock and Wilcox&#39;s own catalogues entitled &#34; Steam,&#34; I find a picture of the latest type of tubular boiler which they manufacture, which was covered by patent No. 6623. in the State of Victoria. This patent was registered on the- 25th March, 1889, and expired in the same month of 1903. </para>

                        <para>- Fourteen or fifteen years ago. I also have here two plates of a 12 horse-power portable engine of which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Renshaw,</inline> of South Melbourne, has made four, which are working in Victoria to-day. .  His  price for each of them was <inline font-style="italic">&#163;221.</inline> I have still another plate of a six horsepower engine and boiler, of which the same firm has manufactured six, two* in 1905, two in 1906, and two during the present year. If any honorable member doubts the accuracy of my statement he  has  only to visit the establishment in question, where he will see an 8&#163; horse-power portable engine and boiler which has &#39; been manufactured to the order of the Metropolitan Board of Works. Twelve engines of the same type have&#39;, been sold for ^227 each. Is any other evidence necessary to prove that this class of machinery is being manufactured here commercially ? There is not a man in Australia who can doubt the efficacy of the steam road roller which was manufactured to the order of the Collingwood City Council.. It burns the minimum, quantity of coal, it is doing its work efficiently, and it was made in Australia. If engineering firms in. this State had to .manufacture the whole of the road  rollers  required &#39; in Australia they would - be in &#39; a. position &#39; to pro7duce them at a very much reduced price. We all know that a start has to &#39;be made at some&#39; time. In the first instance a manufacturer has to incur considerable expense before he can produce an article, but in later- years he can manufacture, it at a much cheaper price.  The Collingwood  Council, who have received, and rightly received, great credit for paying a little more for their road roller, have put the. other councils in a position to  procure road  rollers at a&#34;  very  much &#39; cheaper rate &#39;than has prevailed hitherto. Traction engines have been made satisfactorily in Australia. We are told that in these matters the principal  consideration  is the economical working of the article. I am informed that every user of machinery which has been made in Australia during later years has expressed his- willingness to give a certificate as to economical consumption of coal, durability, and capacity to do the work required. Here is a photograph of a portable engine of a special Australian pattern which was made not with a square firebox but with a round firebox, so that the stumps would not interfere with or disarrange the engine. </para>

                        <para>- No less than twenty of this patented portable engine have been put on the market. Men do not buy a new invention for fun&#39;s sake. They generally satisfy themselves that it is worth buying. This portable engine was satisfactory to the user. If the honorable member does not like that one, then like  Cheapjack  in the market he can take his choice from the other samples of locally-made  engines which are shown in these phonographs. T ought not, perhaps, to blame the honorable member for Corangamite for advocating the proposed reduction of duty. Many of his constituents, being human beings, are selfish to a certain extent, and they,&#39; like all free-traders, wish to secure as free a market as they can in the purchasing of commodities. I can assure the honorable gentleman that within a .quarter of an hour&#39;s walk of this building portable&#39; engines have been manufactured, and the manufacturer has informed me that in point of price they compare very favorably with imported engines. First of -all &#62; we are told that it .is years since these articles were made. As a matter of. fact, the engineering trade in Australia, at any rate in Victoria, did far better thirty years ago than it- is doing now!. &#39; Why ? . Because the- protective Governments .of Victoria in their wisdom,  imposed  such a duty. &#39;that the articles &#39;could be manufactured  here.  -What was good for Victoria cannot be otherwise than beneficial to Australia as &#34;a whole. The. agriculturist, the- grazier, and the mirier are dependent upon the men- in the towns,- arid therefore they -should be prepared to give and take. I ask the representatives of mining districts, &#34; Is it wise to. have only one avenue of employment for men?&#34; Are they so much wedded to the mining industry, to working in the bowels of the earth, that they do not want to bring into existence other avenues of employment for their sons and their daughters&#39; husbands? There is no man in the city, but will concede to the agriculturist the right to . live in the same sense in which he wishes to &#39;live. , But the agriculturist  knows  very well that in large cities there is a ready  market  in which he can always get satisfactory prices for his products. I realize that it is necessary to export certain commodities which we overproduce.  That is essential, and also beneficial to us as a whole. At the same time,  it behoves us to see that one and the other are protected in a certain sense. I do not believe that certain honorable members represent the true feelings of primary producers when they urge the Committee to discourage the manufacture of an article in Australia. </para>

                    <para>.- I am one of those who hold that the great bulk of these engines ought to be made in Australia. I think that, unlike the hot-air engines, they are made to only a very limited extent. In Australia there is a very large market for portable engines. They are used in every State, and are in great demand. I- believe that if there was a properly equipped factory they could be turned out as well as locomotive engines are turned out. It is an industry which we ought to try tq establish in our midst. At the same time, we ought, not to impose too high a duty. I ask the Treasurer to listen to a letter which I received a day or two ago, and which pretty well speaks for itself. Writing on the 23rd of. November, my correspondent says - </para>

                        <para>- No ; I think it would be better to fix the duties at 20 and 15 per cent, respectively. If we did, we should not penalize the industries which have to use portable engines. I want to see the industry started, but I do not wish subsidiary industries to be handicapped too much. I hope that, on reconsideration, the Treasurer may see his way to agree to my suggestion. </para>

                    <para>. - There seems to be a. doubt in the minds of some honorable members as <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> the possibility of making portable engines in Australia. That comes to me as a very great surprise. So far back as I can remember, in the various States portable engines have been made, and made very well indeed. There is nothing extraordinary in the making of a portable engine. But I .feel quite sure that very few traction engines have been made in Australia. Not long since I was looking round Australia for traction engines. In Sydney I found several of Fowler&#39;s traction engines, for which the owners had no use, and could find no sale, as so few of them are used in that State. I was told that more of them were in use in Victoria. It appears that there is very little demand for traction engines, because of the enormous expense caused by wear and tear when the engines are used on the roads to draw heavy loads. Besides, it is only on excellent roads that they can be used in that way. According to the evidence quoted by the honorable member for Bendigo, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pearson,</inline> a Queensland manufacturer, has stated that he can make engines which will work as effectively as Fowler&#39;s best, though they have not the same finish, which is not surprising, because in no country in the world can better engineering finish be given than in. Great Britain. I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pearson&#39;s</inline> engines can do the work required of such &#39; machinery. He says that while he charges from 15 to 16 per cent, more, the sells a better article than the Fowler engine. Therefore a protective duty of  15  or  16  per cent. would give <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pearson</inline> all that he asked for when giving evidence before the Tariff Commission. The honorable member for Bendigo, as  Chairman  of the Commission, recommended a duty of121/2 per cent. on some of these engines, and J take it that he had in his mind traction engines. </para>

                        <para>- The Quick section of. the Tariff Commission recommended  121/2  per cent. on steam road rollers, including scarifiers, while the Fuller section, adopting a different classification, recommended  15per  cent. The Quick section recommended  25  per cent. for other machinery, which, I take it, included portable engines. In Australia manufacturers are in the habit of giving more power per nominal horse-power than is given with imported machinery. That is a failing on the right side which is always noticeable in young countries.. </para>

                        <para>- They can be made commercially here,  all  that is asked for being a protective duty of  15  or  16  per cent. The Minister&#39;s proposed rates are  30  and  25  per cent. I cannot understand that proposal, in view of his utterance in favour of  25  per cent., and in the face of the recommendation of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission that the rate should be  121/2  per cent., and from  15  down to  10  per cent. for other similar machinery. I think that we shall be adopting the happy mean if  we  agree to rates&#34; of  20  and r5 per cent. If the Minister wishes to make progress, he should adopt the line of least resistance. He can accept, with honour, rates of  20  and  15  per cent. ; but if he sticks out for higher rates he will be ignominiously defeated, as he was yesterday. </para>

                    <para>.- I was rather surprised by the outburst of the honorable member for Corangamite. I do not understand why he , asks that portable engines shall be treated differently from other similar engines. He says that they are used on farms, but so, too, are stationary engines. Why should a portable engine be admitted free and a stationary engine be made to pay duty? Does the honorable member see any particular virtue in the fact that an engine is mounted on wheels instead of being bedded ? </para>

                        <para>- No; the Committee was influenced then, as many honorable members, I am sorry to say, are influenced to-day, by too great a desire to coddle and nurse the farmers. All kinds of social legislation is passed by the Commonwealth and State Parliaments, but the attempt is always made to exempt the farmers from its restrictions, and honorable members are trying to exempt them largely from the payment of duties. Farmers should, of course, receive as much consideration as other classes of the community ; but the fact that one kind of engine is more useful on a farm than another is not a reason why it should be imported duty free. Instead of the question asked being &#34; Can we make these engines successfully?&#34; honorable members wish the Committee to consider only the fact that the farmers use them. </para>

                        <para>- As to the matter of price a great deal depends upon whether or not there is a competing industry in Australia. If no portable engines are made in Australia the purchaser will undoubtedly pay more even if there be no import duty. If honorable members in the Opposition corner are. prepared to accept a duty of 20 per cent, on portable engines and traction engines, I shall say no more. Personally, I shall vote for duties of 25 per cent, and 20 per cent. Seeing that we have laid it down that we will impose duties of 20 per cent, on motive power engines, we cannot expect to have a higher duty on these engines simply because they are on wheels. All motive power engines should be treated in the same way. </para>

                        <para>- That is absurd. . Surely we ought to act on logical lines ; or at least honorable members should pretend to be logical. It would really be too ridiculous to differentiate in. motive power engines. A locomotive is an infinitely more complicated machine than a traction engine. It is probably the most highly complex machine in existence. But it is not suggested that we cannot successfully make locomotives in Australia. Even the honorable member for Illawarra would not propose to place them on the free list. But why should locomotives pay a higher duty than portable engines? </para>

If he votes for protection only on goods which the farmer and miner do not use, I am puzzled to know what duties he will support. If the farmer used locomotives the honorable&#39; member would say that they could not be made in Australia.  1  hope that honorable members will, agree to make the duties the same for all machines doing the same kind of work and having about the same degree of complexity. </para>

                    <para>.- Under the 1902 Tariff portable engines and traction engines were admitted duty free. The honorable member for Illawarra is proposing to revert to the position. I shall support him, though I must admit, from what I know of the feeling of the Committee, that there is not much hope in that direction. At the same time, the good sense of the Committee ought to induce us to reduce the proposed duties materially. According to the opinion of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission, the duty should be 25 ,per cent. The Treasurer asks us to make it 30 per cent, with a preference of 5 per cent, in favour of Great Britain. Take an 8 horse-power single cylinder traction engine such as is commonly used. The price is about ,&#163;650. With a duty of 25 per cent, the price would be increased by ,&#163;135. The price of a compound engine is about ,&#163;785. The proposed duty would mean an increase of &#163;150, or thereabouts. Surely the local manufacturer does not require so great a.n addition to the price of imported engines before he can begin to compete. The question is not, as some honorable members and the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission think, whether these engines can be made in Australia, but whether they can be made at a reasonable price. I do not think that traction engines can be made here at a reasonable price, simply because the Australian market is too limited. According to the report of the protectionist section of the Commission, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas</inline> Irons, of Sydney, stated- that there was not a sufficient demand for traction engines at the present time to&#39; justify their manufacture in Australia. There was no doubt in his opinion that a firm would start to make them if the duties were prohibitive. But the plant would be expensive, and a great deal of capital would be lying idle in stock on hand to meet occasional demands. If these engines cannot be made here at a reasonable price, the probability is that more harm than good would be done by imposing a high duty. If people who are now using traction engines cannot purchase them on account of their dearness, a great many men will be thrown out of employment. So that, looking at the question from a broad stand-point, we should lose more than we should gain by a heavy duty. To add &#163;150 to the price of an article worth &#163;750 is to go beyond the bounds of reason. Witnesses before the Tariff Commission stated that they could produce these engines in Australia only at an advance of 15 per cent, or 16 per cent, on the English price. </para>

                        <para>- I think that trac-tion and portable engines should be allowed to come in free, as under the 1902 Tariff, but seeing that the Committee are not likely to agree to that, I am prepared to be reasonable and to vote for a duty of 12J per cent or 15 per cent. Considering the heavy freight, those would be reasonable duties. The honorable member for Fawkner quoted a very pertinent instance in relation to portable engines. The Great Wilberforce Gold Mining Company did their best to get a suitable engine made in Australia, but they could not get a 30 horse-power engine turned out here according to their requirements. </para>

                        <para>- So long as the facts &#39; are true, due weight ought to be given to them. The price of the 30 horse-power engine they required was <inline font-style="italic">^&#163;1,150.</inline> After being landed in Melbourne, it cost ^120 to get it to the mine. A duty of 25 per cent, on such an engine would increase the price by ^250. That means a 2d. call on 30,000 shares to pay the duty. Such a heavy tax is one which many mining companies could not afford to pay. Even if only one mine were closed down, it would mean a great loss of employment. We should look at this question as business men. If honorable members do that, I am quite sure that, even if we do not succeed in having these engines placed on the free list, the duty will be lowered considerably. </para>

                    <para>.- I wish, in the first place, to correct the misstatement made by the honorable member for Corangamite, that road rollers are not portable engines. As a matter of fact, the only difference between a road roller and an ordinary traction engine is that the wheels are in the centre instead of at the side of the machine. It has been said that the effect of this duty will be to increase prices. When the Collingwood City Council proposed to purchase a new road roller, it obtained prices from several importers, but as soon as it determined to call for tenders, and so to invite local competition, the importers reduced their prices by ;&#163;roo. The Council secured a road roller from a Melbourne firm for ,&#163;25 less than it could obtain an imported one. It was made under the present Tariff, and we wish the duty .to remain. In other parts of the world where these engines are! made the workers receive 28s. per week, as against a wage of ,&#163;3 6s. per week paid for the same class of work in Australia-1 As to the Great Wilberforce Mining Company, to which the honorable member for Indi has referred, I may say that it made&#39; no inquiry as to the desirableness of obtaining locally the engine in question. </para>

                    <para>.- I should consider that I was unmindful of my duty to the great primary industries if I supported any attempt to hinder them. It is my intention to heartily support every.&#39; proposal to abolish duties on machines that we cannot make here. &#34; The machinery and engines now under consideration car* readily be made in Australia, and I am, therefore, prepared to vote for a protective duty. I fail to understand the attitude of so-called protectionists who desire a revenue duty to be. imposed. &#39; They would make the Tariff so low as to render it impossible&#39; to establish the industry in Australia, and so to give rise to the healthy* competition that we desire. It is my intention to support duties of 25 per cent and 20 per cent, on this item, and I dis-! agree with those who say that such duties will greatly increase the prices of these engines. The result of a healthy local com--&#39; petition is to bring down the prices of im-&#39; ported machines. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; so far as imports from Great Britain are concerned; but I am willing to vote for a duty of  25  per cent. on imports of this kind from other parts of the world in order that a preference may be granted to the Mother Country. I am not prepared to injure local industry by voting for the imposition of an ineffective duty on British imports. I am surprised at the attitude of the honorable member for Barrier, who is opposed to preferential trade. If I think that anything less than a duty, of  20  per cent. would be ineffective, as against British imports, why should I vote for a duty of  15  per cent. ? </para>

                        <para>- No. I am. prepared to afford every man in Australia an opportunity to buy British-made engines, but if he desires to dp so, he ought to be prepared to pay a little more for them, or the British manufacturer should be ready to pay this duty and land his engines as cheaply as he can. We have been asked what consideration we are extending in this matter to the miner. I have been associated with mining, both as a speculator and as a worker, and am satisfied that the establishment of this industry in Australia will enable those engaged in mining to obtain their machinery cheaper later on. The position will be the same in regard to pumping engines for irrigation purposes. Irrigation, together with the making of ensilage, and the storing of other fodders in times of plenty, will lead to the salvation of the Commonwealth. In the days to come the engines included in this item will be in great demand, and we cannot do better than so legislate that their cost will be reduced. I am surprised that some honorable members should imagine that the miners and farmers have so restricted an outlook that they would have us legislate only for to-day. They are quite prepared to bear their share of any burden involved in the establishment of industries native to Australia, and to support such legislation as will attract population to Australia, and enable her to offer an effective defence in the day of need. </para>

                    <para>. - My experience as a politician convinces me that no speech made during the consideration of the Tariff is likely to affect a single vote; but I hope to influence some votes by a quotation. I quote from a letter received from Messrs. Welch, Perrin and Company, English manufacturers, the statement that an 8-h.p. traction engine costs&#163;650, and I wish to inform the Committee that Messrs. Cliff and Bunting, of North Melbourne, manufactured an 8-h.p. traction engine this year, which they exhibited at the Victorian Agricultural Show. It was subsequently sold to a farmer for &#163;6oo, and is now working satisfactorily at Shepparton. I make the point that the price put upon the imported engine is &#163;650, and that a local manufacturer has sold for <inline font-style="italic">-&#163;600</inline> a similar engine, which is giving complete satisfaction. </para>

                    <para>. -The question is not whether these &#39;engines&#39; can be made in the Commonwealth, but whether they are being made here in sufficient numbers to enable those who require them to obtain them at a reasonable price. Apparently, in view of the volume of importation, this has not been done in the past. I do not wish to make an appeal on behalf of the poor squatters and farmers. I wish to see justice done, but, while we should have every regard for the secondary industries, we should not forget the interests of the primary industries on which they depend. In my opinion, those who are prepared to push their protectionist principles to the point of prohibition on behalf of the secondary industries are the worst enemies of those industries. If the miners, squatters, and farmers did not use machinery, the workshops of the secondary industries would speedily be closed up. I am afraid that very often honorable&#39; members are interviewed by the promoters of secondary industries, and, as a result of&#39; the representations made to them, are induced to forget the interests of the primary industries. I am just as anxious as are my protectionist friends to see the manufacture of engines and machinery promoted, but I do not wish to see the primary industries heavily handicapped by prohibitive taxation upon the machinery and implements they require for their development. These portable and traction engines are very largely used in the pastoral, mining, and farming industries of the Commonwealth. If they are to progress, labour-saving appliances must be used even to a larger extent than at present in those industries. I can inform the Committee that the mineral recovered from the mining property at Nymagee, in the electorate of the honorable member for Darling, which abuts upon my own electorate, is conveyed a considerable distance to the nearest railway station by means of a traction engine. In my own electorate during the drought of 1902-3 the owners of one station spent &#163;120,000 on fodder imported to save their stock; and a large quantity of that fodder was conveyed from the&#39; nearest railway station by a traction engine. Along the Lachlan there are numbers of settlers engaged in irrigating large and small areas, and traction engines are largely used in that kind of work. </para>

                        <para>- The percentage is not a large one, but I wish to see it increased, because every farmer who is in a position to employ one of these engines on his farm will be able to do a great deal more work than he can do without it. If this class of machinery can be obtained at a reasonable price farmers will be in a position to make use of it who must do without&#39; it if the price is considerably increased as the result of the imposition of a prohibitive duty. It is in the interests of the farming, mining, and pastoral industries that I wish to have these engines placed upon the market at something like a reasonable price. I prefer that they should be manufactured in Australia, but imported engines of this description should not be shut out if they cannot be produced here at a reasonable price. The experience of the Wilberforce Gold Dredging Company is a striking illustration of the effect of these duties. They have presented a petition to this House, the facts stated in which have not been controverted. They have expended something like &#163;10,000 in mining development. Their work is not carried on in the back blocks of Queensland or New South Wales, where they might have some difficulty in obtaining information as to the development of manufacturing industries in the Commonwealth. Their operations are carried on in the vicinity of Melbourne, and they have informed honorable members that they have purchased &#163;3,000 worth of machinery from Victorian manufacturers. It is clear, therefore, that if they could obtain the engine which they found indispensable for their work from the Victorian firms from whom they purchased their other machinery, at a reasonable figure, they would have done so. They have said that they were obliged to import a 30 horse-power engine, because they could not get their order for such an engine executed here. </para>

                        <para>- It is all very well for the Treasurer to tell the Committee that they did not inquire. They inquired for ,&#163;3,000 worth of machinery, and it is therefore reasonable to assume that if they could have secured the 30 horse-power engine in the Commonwealth they would have done so rather than go to the expense of importing it. They made inquiries, and were unable to get it here. In the interests of hypothetical production, the Treasurer submitted a duty of 25 per cent, on these machines, which would represent a tax of &#163;250 upon this company in the purchase of the engine referred to. Not satisfied with- that, the honorable gentleman yesterday proposed to jump the duty up another 5 per cent., making these engines dutiable at 30 per cent. I can give another instance. I have here a letter which I suppose other honorable members also&#39; have received, from the firm of Welch, Perrin, and Company, of Melbourne. They state that under the old Tariff they were selling three lines of 8 horse-power single cylinder, compound cylinder, and portable engines at &#163;650, <inline font-style="italic">&#163;750,</inline> and &#163;285 respectively; and the mere imposition of the increased duty has had the result of increasing the price of these engines to .&#163;785&#62;. <inline font-style="italic">&#163;9&#176;S&#62;</inline> and &#163;341 respectively. The  Chairman  of the Tariff Commission has said that the Austral Otis Company are prepared to produce similar 8 horse-power  engines for -^&#34;720, &#163;825, and &#163;325 respectively. This indicates, assuming that those engines are identical - and, so far as I can judge, they are - with the engines put on the market here by Messrs. Welch, Perrin, and Company, that there is an advance in the case of the Otis Company of ,&#163;70 in the price of the 8 horse-power single cylinder; of &#163;j5 in the price of the 8 horse-power compound cylinder engine; and of &#163;40 in the price of the 8 horse-power portable engine. This means that, if these high duties are imposed, and the engines are made locally, on the basis indicated by the Otis Company, the farmers, graziers, and miners will have to pay that much more for them than they have been paying. That is the hard pounds shillings and pence side of the question. It means &#39;a considerable additional burden to the primary producer. Is it reasonable that he should not be considered in this matter at all ? Should not his interests have weight with the Committee? I have presented to the Committee concrete facts, first regarding the mining&#34; company I have indicated, and next as to the difference of price between those two reputable firms- the Otis Company and Welch, Perrin and Company. </para>

                        <para>- I did not claim that they were. I am showing to what extent they are helping the primary producer by supplying him with his machinery. I should like to see these machines on the free list, but, if I cannot get that, I propose to vote only for that amount of taxation which .will not be severely felt by the primary producer. I do not pro* pose to move any amendments myself, but I shall support those that have been indicated. The Treasurer seems to overlook the fact that in the great protectionist countries of Canada and New Zealand a great many of these engines are on the free list&#39;, or were kept upon the free list until such times as they could be produced locally., other means- such as bounties in Canada - being adopted to bring them to that stage. But here, the Treasurer proposes a heavy 30 per cent. tax, practically saying to the primary producer, &#34; You will have to buy these machines at that price, or do without them.&#34; In that way he proposes to encourage the secondary producer.  His  policy is largely that of killing the goose that lays the golden eggs. If he penalizes the primary producer to that extent he will find that it will react upon the secondary producer, and that, instead of helping the latter, this prohibitive Tariff will be really a detriment to him. </para>

                    <para>One of the exhibits at the Royal Show which is sure to attract and hold the attention of the majority of visitors next week will be a handsome, well-balanced, and serviceable traction engine, designed and manufactured by Messrs. Cliff and Bunting, of North Melbourne. This engine - a photograph of which appears in the pictorial pages - is the outcome of years of practical study of Australian conditions and needs. It has been designed and built in Australia, every part has been made in Australia, every feature has been carefully thought out, and &#34;the result is an engine which will give satisfactory service under all conditions - on metal roads, on earth roads, and in paddocks hauling or ploughing. The excellent quality of the material used throughout not only .insures great strength, but materially reduces the weight of the engine, which is just seven and a-half tons, so that it is well within the weight limit allowed on bridges&#39; and culverts. The strength and lightness, combined with wide road wheels, means that no injury is done to metal roads, whilst heavy loads can be hauled in swampy paddocks where weightier engines would stick fast. . . . Two-speed gear is fitted ; quick speed for use on good roads and to make good time, and slow speed for use on rough or bad roads, or when there is a heavy load behind. The reverse is a single eccentric, very easy to handle and with little liability to wear. One of the features of the engine is the wonderful ease&#39; with which it is steered. </para>

                        <para>- The price is. not given. The honorable member&#39; for Batman knows more than I do about the combined road roller and traction engine made recently for the Collingwood City Council, and regarding which I was questioned this afternoon. That honorable member was to a large extent instrumental in having that work done here. The Collingwood. Council invited tenders for it. The tenders came in, but a movement was started to get the machine made here. The moment it was discovered that the Collingwood Council had decided to have it made here the outside tenderers reduced their price by &#163;100. I am told that the price of the accepted . engine .was 25 per cent, less than, the importers&#39; tender price.  The honorable Member for Calare made certain quotations -o&#39;f importers&#39;- prices. Those importers will do exactly as the other importers, did&#39; .in -the case of the Collingwood engine. The moment, they, know there is going to be opposition here, and that good engines are being made here, their, price to the farmer &#34;will come down immensely, and the farmer will benefit very largely, from the fact &#39;that we are protecting an engine which is made here, and which they can &#62; -use.   The honorable&#39; member for Calare, when &#39; he&#34; looks at the &#34;picture in the <inline font-style="italic">Australasian</inline> of the traction engine  1  have mentioned, will admit that he never saw a j better- machine. It is suitable to Australian&#39; conditions. Just as the harvester people applied their inventive powers to turning out a harvester fitted foi; Australian conditions, and have also adapted other agricultural machinery to Australian conditions, so the local makers have adapted this machine, to Australian requirements. The practical position before us to-day is that, by putting a&#39; good duty on these imported machines, we shall give employment to our own people, and&#39; get machines made, like the one I have just shown to honorable members, as good as any ever built. </para>

                    <para>.- This item raises the whole question of whether we are to resort to revenue or protective duties. I have been all my life a very ardent free-trader, but I have never yet conceded, nor am I now going to. concede, the expediency of revenue duties.- I have to ask myself,, in view of what has been said this afternoon, which of the three :duties proposed - &#39;15  per - cent., 20 per cent., and 30- per cent. - is likely to prove most effective so far as production in this country is. concerned, and- which will be productive of the most revenue. Although, what the honorable member for. Calare has said is no doubt true, that if a duty is imposed somebody has to pay it, it is also perfectly obvious that if so low a duty- is imposed as not to encourage people in this country to make the article, those who import it will be able, in the absence of opposition, to form a- complete ring to fix prices, as all trusts do, by arrangement and not by competition. The one great fact that? the twentieth century and the last years of the nineteenth century have made abundantly clear is that the day for the fixing of prices by competition is either past or passing, and that all prices will in the future be fixed by arrangement.&#39; We, in this Parliament, deliberately propose to pass a law to compel men, within certain limits, to&#34; pav. certain wages and sell at certain prices. Honorable members should not merely say that, if we impose a certain duty, prices will rise to the extent. of that duty; because, I presume, it will not be denied that we can make eight-horse traction engines in Australia. If I had charge of all the industries in the country, and were all-wise - a supposition which, seeing that I am not on the Treasury benches, is obviously absurd - I should protect the iron and steel industry beyond alf others, as the one that requires the most skill and affords the greatest opportunities. There are more ramifications every day in this modern world of ours springing from the engineering industry than: from any other. Although machines every day replace or displace skilled labour, yet, as a matter of fact, the great machines are becoming in themselves so marvellously -complex, as to demand the highest skill and intelligence in their management, and particularly in their making.&#39; It cannot be said that it is impossible to make a traction engine in Australia. Such an engine does not differ, excepting in its wheels, and in its potential speed, from a&#39; locomotive. The honorable member for1 Boothby, who is an engineer, has said that the locomotive engine is the most complex:&#39; of all, and, no doubt, that is true enough. The question whether we can make, traction engines is . not to be debated, because it is very obvious that we can ; and that we have not done so-- if we have not - is entirely owing to the fact; that insufficient inducements have been held&#34;, out.&#39;  Now, we have come, through no ac&#34;rtion of mine, or -of persons thinking- with - me, face to face with Government proposals to&#39;, .&#39;raise&#39; a Large amount&#34;, of. revenue. . The? necessity for this step may partly be attributed to the constitutional blot, which compels us to raise four times more revenue than we require. We are not asked to say whether engines shall be free or dutiable, but whether the duty shall be 15 per cent., <inline font-style="italic">20</inline> per cent., or 25 per cent. The honorable member ford Calare is one who will cheerfully vote for a duty of 15 per cent. But that duty, added to insurance and freight, and taking into account the difference in the value of the articles here and in the place of origin, is equivalent to at least 22 per cent. or 23 per cent. The honorable member for Calare and others are, therefore, in favour of imposing a revenue duty to that extent. They tell us that such a duty is not sufficient to be felt by the people, or, at any rate, not to be appreciably felt ; but directly it is proposed to add another 5 per cent., we have presented to us pictures of the most terrific and awesome character as to the consequences. The honorable member for Wilmot told us that a certain machine would, under such a duty, cost <inline font-style="italic">&#163;100</inline> more than formerly, and the honorable member for Calare told us of another machine which would cost &#163;70 more. If an engine - I do not care what sort - can be made in this country, it will compete with imported engines, and prices will fall - that prices fall in competition is very obvious. I have, or had, in my possession a letter from a kerosene oil company, I do not know which, to the effect that if the duty of 3d. per gallon be taken off certain oils, then another company will have a monopoly, and prices will rise; that is to say, directly there is a monopoly prices rise. A man must be blind, or shut his eyes to facts, if he does not realize that there are importers&#39; rings just as there are manufacturers&#39; rings. Rings are not confined to any particular class ; wherever there is profit there we find a ring, just as wherever there is carrion there we find the crows. That being the obvious fact, we have to ask ourselves whether, as a matter of hard and solid fact, the imposition of another 5 per cent. will not result in a lower price rather than in a higher one. I learn to my great satisfaction, that farmers are in the habit of purchasing traction engines quite frequently. I have worked for farmers myself many times; and I only knew one man who had a traction engine which travelled with a thresher round the country. Farmers must be more prosperous than they used to be, or than they say they are; and I should be glad to see many of them possessed of engines. It is of no use pointing to the poor farmers as victims. The farmers have had ample consideration, and the operative and skilled artisan ought now to receive some attention. Since we have to raise a large revenue, why not raise it in a way that will give employment to numerous people? I will not vote for a revenue duty ; the mere fact that I am told that a revenue duty is proposed is enough to cause me to vote against it. I know only one effective way of raising revenue, and that is by direct taxation - not necessarily on land - and, if I am forced to choose, I shall not support very low duties, because I hate taxation that falls on the shoulders of very poor people. But he is not a poor person who can buy a traction engine worth from &#163;200 to &#163;700. Personally, I am not a very poor person, but, at the same time, I cannot afford to buy a fraction engine. I have been hesitating a long while about getting a very flimsy sort of pumping apparatus, and I find the price, to me at any rate, quite prohibitive. The Treasurer has proposed duties of 30 per cent. and 25 per cent. ; but he is an enthusiast, and, when he says 30 per cent., he very often means 20 per cent., and is very glad that is understood to be his meaning: Therefore, I shall vote for the same duty on this item, as I did on the last. </para>

                    <para>.- Yesterday we had an exhibition of what is generally termed in political circles &#34; getting in out of the wet,&#34; and to-day we have had the most shameless display of the kind known since the creation of this Parliament. The honorable member for West Sydney is the apostle of free-trade; and has scores of times, on the floor of this House, contended that duties increase prices. Yet he tells us to-day that the imposition of the proposed duty will mean decreased prices. If the honorable member is right, his argument would apply to every item we have dealt with in this Tariff. Much as I value my position much as I appreciate the honour conferred upon me by my constituents - I would sooner walk out of Parliament to-morrow, than give such an exhibition as we have witnessed to-day. How far is the honorable member for West Sydney from the fact, when he says that duties decrease prices? The duty now proposed by the Government means an increase from&#163;650 to&#163;785 on one class of portable engine; on another class of engine, from&#163;750 to ,&#163;905 ; and on another, from &#163;285 to &#163;341. On the very engine under discussion, under the old Tariff, there was protection, including freightage and other charges, amounting to 33 per cent., whereas the proposed duty means a protection to the extent of 40 per cent. The honorable member for Bendigo told us today that the Austral Otis Company, which is primarily interested in this duty, can manufacture eight-horse power single cylinder engines at &#163;720; eight-horse&#39; power compound engines at &#163;825 ; and eight-horse power portable engines at &#163;325. But the Austral Otis Company have increased their selling prices on these lines by <inline font-style="italic">&#163;l&#176;, &#163;l5&#62;</inline> and  j&#163;40  respectively. What becomes then of the honorable member&#39;s argument that the imposition of this duty will have the effect of reducing the price of these engines? The high price of horses at the present time renders it almost obligatory that a large number of farmers shall use portable engines to provide them with motive power. The one purpose which they have in view is to cheapen the cost of production. Yet the Committee are asked to sanction - in the interests practically of one firm - a proposal to increase the cost of these machines to the extent that I  have indicated. I venture to &#39;say that if the Committee assent to that proposal, this firm will take full advantage of its position. It will have its pound of flesh, and, in doing so, I do not suggest for a moment that it is any worse than is the average individual. Upon the first class of machine, it will have a margin of &#163;65 upon which to increase its price directly this duty is imposed. Upon, the second class of engine, it will have a margin of &#163;80, and upon the smaller engines, it will have a margin of &#163;60. The Committee, I regret to say, have already authorized the collection of duties upon the tools of trade of the producers, as well as upon the necessaries of life. But if honorable members were to visit the various factories in the city of Melbourne, they would find that in nine cases out of ten. the tools of trade and the raw materials of these establishments have been placed upon the free list. If they had not been out <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> that category, the manufacturers of Victoria would have been in the lobbies of this House pestering honorable members. I recollect my experience when the 1902 Tariff was under consideration. Upon that occasion, the boot manufacturers engaged in lobbying for the purpose of getting a duty of 30 per cent, imposed upon boots. What happened subsequently? They invaded the room occupied by the free-trade members of the House, whom they requested to abolish the duty of 15 per cent, which was being collected upon leather, on the ground that leather was their raw material. </para>

                        <para>- I am quite aware of that; but I was induced to transgress bv the interjection of the Postmaster-General. If there be any class in Australia which deserves consideration at our hands, it is that of the primary producers. Can honorable members point to a single line in this Tariff which will benefit either the &#39; farmer or the miner? The products of the miner have to compete in the markets of the world, and the same remark is applicable to those of the farmer. I say that it would pay our primary producers to pension off the men employed in the manufacture of these engines, &#39; if, bv so doing, they were permitted to obtain their tools of trade and the necessaries of life at the lowest possible rate. I have had some experience of the lives which our farmers lead, and I know the difficulties with which they have to contend. I am  acquainted with men in the arid portions of South Australia, who have obtained from their holdings very little more than seed-wheat, and the necessary flour upon which to live. As a matter of fact,  I have seen them maintaining their families, not upon bread, but upon boiled wheat. Yet this Committee will go into heroics if it can provide work for twenty men, altogether ignoring the fact that by its action 500 individuals are being penalized. I have known men upon the land whose wheat crop did not average one bushel per acre per year for practically ten Years, and during some of those years, wheat realized only is. 4d. per bushel. </para>

                        <para>- No; I said that the farmers did not average more than a bushel of wheat to the acre, and that it realized only is. 4d. For years I saw the men sow their seed, and where I expected to see a crop, I saw red fallow land ; no wheat came up at all. Yet, With honorable (members who live in a fine climate, and are surrounded by the manufacturing interests, the only consideration, apparently, is to pile on duties, ostensibly to create labour. It does not matter to&#62; them what duties are imposed, so long as they create labour in the towns, if it be created for only ten, twenty, or thirty men. It concerns them very little whether they penalize hundreds of primary producers who cannot possibly derive any advantage from the Tariff. What did the Prime Minister say only a few years ago in regard to the imposition of duties levied on agricultural implements, which I declare are essential to enable agriculturists to contend with climatic conditions, vermin, and various other things, in the poorest country, whither they have been driven, by land monopoly? Yet, the Government propose to increase their burdens. I trust that the Committee will fix as low duties as possible on these tools of trade, which are essential to cheap production by primary producers, and which, as time goes on, &#34;will be used still more largely. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">.- Mr.</inline>Fowler,  I think you will admit that as a rule, the last speaker is a pretty warm sort of chap, and is fairly consistent. Tonight he has told you that he would rather walk out of public life than do certain things; that he would rather take a political cake-walk out of this assembly than go back on his  free trade  principles. We must all admit that he is about the most consistent man in this Parliament in advocating the extension of free-trade. If the Committee had been voting on the lines which he has stated right through the  consideration  of this Tariff, probably he would have found other honorable members keeping him  company.  I had the pleasure of sitting with him in the first Parliament. At that time the only weak spot he had - and it has been weak ever since that date - was a small patch of Tariff matter, but a bit of salt went over &#34;the patch and removed the difficulty. </para>

                        <para>- I generally extend more than ordinary courtesy to my fellow members, and particularly to the honorable &#39; member for Grey. We are not here, however, for the purpose of cultivating personal friendships. I do not believe that there is a stronger friendship between two members of the House than exists between the honorable member and myself. I do not know how it may be affected by my remarks this afternoon. I trust that the honorable member will not be fractious under my observations, because he can pepper us very strongly when he likes. He has rubbed it in strongly in his last speech. He, in common with others when it suits their purpose, imposes a  self-denying  ordinance, so far as Tariff matters are concerned. I do not think that the electorate of Grey is full of industrials to manufacture anything. I have not vet heard that it was a teeming mass&#39; of factories. And when the honorable member says he is prepared to take a political cake-walk out of the chamber rather than do certain things, I take the liberty of saying that probably the policy which he is advocating is a just and useful policy to a constituency in which there are no strong vested interests, no thousands of men engaged in factories, no hundred varieties of industries which- require or ask for assistance. It is just as well, sir, for me to throw that sidelight. The honorable member for Dalley, when he addresses you, does not pretend to defend this item on economic grounds any more than he would on any other grounds ; but he says openly that as honorable members rise in their places they show that they are freetraders or protectionists, in patches, just as it suits them, and he generally finds that the patch which is put most strongly before the Chair is the patch in their own electorate where a particular industry, is concerned. So far as pestering is concerned either by personal approach or in any other way - let me tell the honorable member for Grey that not on any item have I been approached directly by either importer or manufacturer. . That is the stand which I took on the first Federal Tariff, and the stand which I take on this  Tariff. Certainly I have received their circulars, but that has been all. If ever they have got near enough to speak to me, in my electorate or elsewhere, I have asked them to keep off the Tariff question, and to allow me to deal with it as a man who is responsible to his constituency for his votes. I do not ask any one else to share my responsibility. I wish the honorable member for Grey to understand that I have no recollection of the incident to which he referred just now. I do not question that it occurred as he said. Probably the way in which I then dealt &#39; with any attempt at pestering has prevented any one from attempting to pester me in connexion with this Tariff. Referring to the item before the- Chair, I suppose that the largest engineering  estab.lishment  in New South Wales is in my electorate. There&#39; are also many similar establishments there. Out of all those firms not one of them by letter, to say nothing of a personal interview, has approached me in regard to this - item. There is a clear statement of my position, sir. I would not pursue that course any longer, only that I wish to make my case clear. When I was before my electors during the last campaign, I said openly&#39;, &#34; So far as the doctrine of free-trade is concerned on the necessaries of life, such as food supplies, &#38;c, I shall endeavour to get you the lowest possible duties. But as regards&#34; any other question when I find men, either free-traders or protectionists in patches, fighting to get a little assistance for their own electorates&#39;, I shall take care that, as your representative, I shall not be slow in demanding a little share of that protection for my electors.&#34; That is a frank, open statement. Perhaps, sir, you may say that it was a foolish statement for me to make, but I made it, and am answerable to my constituents. I am now carrying out, rightly or  wrongly,  my self-imposed policy at the last election. Yesterday, when a similar item was submitted, the plea put forward was that it would be all right if it did not affect mining machinery. </para>

                <para class="block">You, sir, pleaded with honorable members not to put penalties on the great mining experiments of Australia. You put that plea pretty strongly before the Committee. You said that you would not be like the honorable member for Dalley - . such a practically low-minded individual as to fight for your electorate. You declared that you would not do such a thing, that you were such a noble-hearted, elevated patriot, that all you thought about was the ruination of your State. </para>

                        <para>- I must not take too much liberty, because it was said by an honorable member who at present is handcuffed. I would not like to be sitting in the chair, sir, and to be referred to as I am referring to the honorable member for Perth, who is generally very calm in his speech, and very careful as to his statements. When he put that position to the honorable member for Dalley, he put it very nicely. In fact, with a sort of sorrowful air, he said that he stuck up for his electorate, but that he, like the honorable member for Grey, would rather walk out of Parliament than do such a thing as he indicated. &#34;In may. State,&#34; &#39; he said,&#39; &#34; the engineers are more benefited by the successful running of mining ventures than by anything else.&#34; So, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fowler,</inline> I find that even that honorable gentleman had a patch. I do not wish to speak rudely, but my nature is a bit rough. I think that there is just as much human nature to the square inch in yourself as there is in the carcase of the honorable member who is addressing you. Yesterday, you were looking after your State. To-day, when this particular industry is concerned, I am looking after, not only my electorate, but also my State. We have dealt with the item of mining machinery, and now that we are dealing with another item, what is the plea put forward? The plea is made on behalf of somebody else - poor struggling men who buy traction engines at . &#163;400 or&#163;500; poor individuals who walk into an engineering establishment and give an &#34;order for a piece of machinery costing from . &#163;500 to &#163;1,000. Poor devils! </para>

                        <para>- I do not wish to pursue that argument any further, but to refer to the item before the Chair - to locomotives, traction engines, and other things. Some honorable members desire to have a revenue duty, but I ask them to abolish their idea of getting revenue by this means, and put the articles on the free list. If they think that those who use these engines will have a severe tax placed upon them, let them not vote for a duty of 15 or 121/2 per cent.; because that will be imposed upon the users, and will be of no benefit to the engineering fraternity. There is no compensating advantage in imposing such low duties. With them it is only a question of imposing heavy duties on articles which, according to their own statement, are the tools of trade of the down-trodden masses, for that is the way in which they put it to you, sir. If they hold that view, do not let them fool with the question at all. Let the honorable member for Swan, and those who think with him that the duty is a severe imposition upon people, and cannot encourage local manufacture, put the articles on the free list. I will show them what sort of an animal I am. If I. cannot get an effective duty, I will vote to place the articles on the free list. </para>

                        <para>- I thank the honorable member very much for his condescension. With regard to locomotives, even the State of New South Wales has got out of its free-trade ideas. A few years ago its Government refused to purchase locomotive engines for running on their railways, and made arrangements for some to be manufactured at the Eveleigh workshops under Government control by their own workers. The free-trade press of New South Wales accepted that arrangement with the warmest praise, because it meant work for the engineering fraternity. I was very pleased indeed to think that the railway workshops of the State were going in for the manufacture of locomotives. I am only showing you, sir, that .they all have little patches of protection upon them. That is a patch which I hope to see enlarged before the debate in regard to machinery is concluded. : Honorable members have said that in the past the demand for traction engines has been so small that it did not pay engineering firms to attempt to manufacture them. An engineering&#34; establishment cannot be started except with a larger expenditure on plant. The man who thinks that he. can start with . a file, and  2s.  6d. in his pocket, will soon file his schedule. We have heard a good deal about the great amount of plant lying idle in the nail-making industry, which employs twenty men ; but I ask those who voted for a duty of  40  per cent, to protect that industry, why they should be frightened to give  30  per cent, to protect the immensely larger engineering industry ? One engineering firm alone in my electorate pays from  &#163;150,000  to  &#163;170,000  a year in wages. If a man is going to make a splash at all, he should do it for the engineering and iron-working trades, which are national in their character. Engineering establishments are not confined to Victoria and New South Wales. If the Tariff encourages manufacturing, there will be engineering establishments, not only all along the eastern sea-board, but also in Western Australia as well. The trouble of the Western Australian people to-day is that, if they import from the eastern States, they have heavy freights to pay; but with engineering establishments of their own they will be able to get what they want locally. Although the new grouping of items which the Treasurer has brought forward is an improvement, it still leav.es things in an unsatisfactory position. Why should steam turbines be placed on the free list, and a duty of  25  per cent, be imposed on high-speed engines - both of which are used for practically the same purposes? Great Britain leads the world in the manufacture of this kind of machinery, and it will be some time before we can make equally good machinery of the kind here. But the differentiation to which I refer is an anomaly. Both turbines and high-speed engines should be on the free list, or both should be dutiable at  25  per cent. Coming to the question of preference, I have throughout showed the hollowness of the preferential trade proposals. They have been used to secure a lower Tariff, and I have been glad to avail myself of them to bring about the reduction of duties on articles of ordinary consumption. But I am not willing to pretend to do something for the engineering industry, and then take away any advantage by imposing a low duty upon British importations. I ask the Government to go for rates of  30  and  25  per cent. , if they can get them, or, if not, for an all round rate of  25  per cent. </para>

                    <para>. - I should not take part in this debate had it not been for the strange speech of the honorable member for Grey- I take this opportunity to point out, I hope once and for all, that others as well as he represent farming constituencies, and have .the interests of the farmers at heart. It will not  help  his cause to put the farmers in a&#39; false position bv making them appear antagonistic to an Australian policy. The bulk of them are in favour of an Australian policy, because they know that they owe their existence as farmers to it. Does the honorable member think that the Committee will accept such an exaggerated statement as he&#39; made ? </para>

I have been a farmer, and have undergone as many hardships and troubles as any farmer in the country; but 1 do not believe it possible that for ten consecutive years farmers in any district have had to live on boiled wheat, with a yield of half a bushel to the acre, which they sold at is. 4d. per bushel. The farmers in my electorate have suffered as much as those in the northern parts of South Australia. They are called upon to suffer greatly at times, by reason of droughts. </para>

                        <para>- I am dealing with the contention of the honorable member for Grey, that traction engines should not be made dutiable, because farmers who have been in the terrible position which he mentioned are forced to buy them for use instead of horses. I challenge the honorable member for Grey to find in any State 500 <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> farmers - I am not alluding to large pastoralists - 5 per cent, of whom are employing traction engines and other powerful engines. The 5 per cent, might use them for threshing purposes, travelling round with them from farm to farm, making a levy upon the farmers who use them. A farmer who understands his business knows full well the advantage of breeding a high class of stock. There will always be a demand, both in Australia and outside, for ten times the number of horses we can breed in this country. The arguments used to induce the Committee not to agree to a substantial duty, in this instance, are  the most extraordinary I ever heard coming from a so-called farmers&#39; representative. </para>

                        <para>- I say nothing of the kind. Some honorable members who represent mining or farming constituencies look at a matter of this kind simply from the point of view of their own electorates, and appear to be incapable of regarding it from any other aspect: Consider it from the miner&#39;s point of view. Will it be denied that the miner has been benefited by industrial legislation, by means of which importers&#39; monopolies have been compelled to bring down their prices? The reduction in the cost, of machinery has enabled the employers to pay better wages than they could otherwise have done. In years gone- by, before Victoria and other States, entered into the manufacture of machinery; from a serious, point .of -view, prices were  joo  per cent, higher than they are to-day. </para>

                <para>Mi. CHANTER.- What I say as to machinery cannot be contradicted ; statistics prove it. I know of no farmers who use  steam rollers, traction engines, and powerful engines of other classes. I know of very large capitalists &#34;who may. sometimes want them for extensive irrigation works ; but when I speak of a farmer, I mean a working man who drives his own .plough and tills with his. own implements. </para>

The farmer and* the miner have also &#39;been benefited by opportunities being afforded for their sons to enter into-, other; fields of employment.&#39; A miner does not; want his sons to be always miners. </para>

                        <para>- The greed for gold has -induced men to go,- sometimes to &#39;theArctic Regions, and .at other times to the hottest of countries. The point is, however, that our farmers and miners have not been- driven out of Australia,&#39; and we want &#39; them to remain . here. The mirier is; as much interested in our manufacturing; industries &#39;as are other classes, not only? from the point of view of his own benefit, but for the sake of the community of which he is part. I know hundreds, of cases, especially on the Bendigo field, with which I am well acquainted, of miners who have left the mines and entered into industrial - occupations. How would a farmer be benefited by the policy df those honorable members -who, by placing such machines as we are considering upon the free list, would drive our manufacturing industries out of the Common-  wealth? Will not the farmer be benefited by such an increase of industries as will increase the population of Australia? If the factories are emptied, whom are we going to depend upon to fight for Aus-&#39; tralia if a time of stress should come? We cannot depend upon those who want to keep our chimneys from smoking and our wheels from revolving. The farmer knows that he is benefited from the prosperity of our manufacturing industries. They create for him a large home market. He has two  markets to depend upon, one of which he can to a certain extent control, whilst the other is beyond his control.  His  home market is increased by affording profitable employment to thousands of workmen. I challenge another statement made by the honorable member for Grey. .He said that the effect of every Tariff that has been passed had been to increase the price of every article upon which a duty was imposed, and that the farmer had to pay more for everything he ate and everything he used. Well, a good farmer does not usually require to buy much to eat. He produces that for himself. As for prices, will any one deny that until the policy of protection was applied in Australia, every machine and every article was dearer by  too  per cent, than is the case to-day? That is a statement that cannot be contradicted. </para>

I sincerely hope the Committee will bass_ this item with the duty, proposed. <inline font-style="italic">t</inline> ask&#39; honorable members to break down once for all the feeling that we cannot make these goods to advantage. Australia has determined upon a protective policy.. The details of the Tariff may require rearranging from time to time, but duties should be so fixed that every one may know that for all time capital may safely be invested in Australian industries. We should let it go forth to the world that capital may be invested in our industries with some hope of return. We can make in Australia all that we require,- and if the majority of honorable members are true to their election pledges, they will vote for a truly protectionist policy, such as is embodied in this Tariff. </para>

                    <para>.- I wish to supply a little information for the benefit of our protectionist friends. The Tariff Commission were told repeatedly by those interested in this industry as workers, that a duty of 25 per cent, on machinery of this kind was of no use whatever to them. If honorable members desire that protection should be afforded to this industry, they must, therefore, vote for much higher duties than 25 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- The effect of a duty of 25 per cent, would simply be to add to the cost of all the machinery included in this item. It would not lead to any appreciable -development of the industry In Australia. That is the opinion of those who asked the Tariff Commission for higher duties. Those who wish to be considered consistent protectionists, should, in this case, vote for higher duties than are now proposed, or leave this machinery dutiable at the rates levied under the old Tariff. </para>

                    <para>. -I am- very sorry to hear the Treasurer make that admission. We have heard from  the honorable member for Perth that if we intend to protect this industry, we should not impose lower duties than those proposed by the Government. I have been very much, surprised by the action of the honorable member for Bendigo in moving his amendment. It must not be forgotten that if the duty imposed under the general Tariff were fixed at 25 per cent, instead of 30 per cent, as proposed bv the Government, it would mean a duty of 20 per cent, on imports from the United Kingdom, because the majority of honorable members are pledged to preference. The Treasurer should have stood by his Tariff, - and I say that the honorable member for Bendigo was bound to support him, if only for the reasons stated by the honorable member for Perth. </para>

He is going against his own recommendation, although he said that he was prepared to stand by the recommendation of the protectionist, section of the Tariff Commission. I say that if we are not to have effective protection for this industry, it is better that this machinery should be admitted free. I have no wish to penalize the users of these machines, unless we can benefit the manufacturers and workers of Australia. I have been prepared to agree with some of the recommendations of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission, but I have never been prepared to vote for duties below those they recommended. It would now appear to be a fact that the  Chairman  of the Tariff Commission is prepared to accept a lower duty than that which he believes will give effective protection. </para>

                        <para>- Wages in this industry are 50 per cent, higher in Kalgoorlie than in Melbourne or Sydney, and if a duty of 25 per cent, is sufficient for Kalgoorlie, manufacturers in Melbourne and, Sydney should be ashamed to ask for a higher rate of duty. In view of the increased cost of labour, a duty of 25 per cent., as applied to .the industry in Kalgoorlie, would be worth 50 per cent, to the industry in Melbourne. At page 2022 of the Tariff Commission&#39;s report it will be found that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Silverthorne</inline> asked&#39; for a duty of 25 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- Because - I thought they were asking for too much. If the Western Australian manufacturers secured that rate of protection, the bigger factories with better facilities in Melbourne and Sydney would secure the same rate. If manufacturers at Kalgoorlie can hold their own with a duty of 25 per cent., those engaged in the industry in Melbourne and Sydney should be able to carry on with the duty imposed under the old Tariff. </para>

                    <para>. - Now we see the ridiculous position in which&#34; we are placed. The honorable member for Bendigo, as  Chairman  pf the Tariff Commission, recommended a duty of 25 per cent, as that which ought to be imposed ; and we have &#34;agreed on that duty in&#39; the general Tariff. I must say that the Treasurer has not shown his usual&#34; astuteness ; because,&#34; although &#39; he might not have the support necessary to carry a duty of 30 per cent., there were still sufficient to enable him to obtain a duty of 25 per cent, all round. Having agreed to allow 25 per cent, to be fixed for the general Tariff, the Government are now practically forced to accept a duty of 20 per cent, as against Great Britain; and&#39; that is certainly not sufficient protection. In the case of the previous item there was no preferential duty ; but now it is proposed to give a preference which will be&#39; injurious to the industry. I invite the honorable member for Bendigo to withdraw&#39;&#39; the amendment, because, in my opinion, the preferential duties are destroying the Tariff. For my part, I shall vote against the amendment. I am sorry to think that honorable members, who went before the country as protectionists, should be found, supporting the amendment of the honorable member for Bendigo. We find honor-, able members like the honorable member for Echuca voting for a duty of 15 per cent. ; and yet, before his constituents, he called himself a protectionist. How can honorable members justify such votes?&#34; Why &#39;do such honorable members not come&#39; out in their true colours and call themselves free-traders? I like honorable mem-&#39; bers to act consistently with the opinions they expressed when before the electors. </para>

                        <para>- How about turbo-blowers? Unless my proposal is ruled out of order, I intend to persist in it. Steam turbines and high-speed, engines practically do the same work in certain places. I understand that the Department urges some objection to the adoption of the course which I propose, because it alleges that it is difficult to differentiate between slow-speed and high-speed engines. But I would point out that in only a few instances, would it be possible to introduce a slow-speed engine under the description of a high-speed engine. In other words, there would have to be a misdescription of the goods. The argument advanced by the Department is not a good one, inasmuch as it might be urged with equal force in regard to every item of the Tariff. Because, in a few instances, it may be possible, under a wrong description, to introduce slow-speed engines as high-speed engines, I do not see why the latter should be refused admittance at  5  per cent, under the general Tariff, or why they should not be included in the free list under the Tariff for the United Kingdom. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to point out that high-speed engines are included in item  162,  which has already been agreed to. A steam turbo-blower may be constructed on exactly the same principle as a steam power, but it is not considered a motive power at all. All these items, and the one to which the honorable member has referred, are included in item  162.  The only way in which that can be altered is by recommitting the item, and taking out the article, because I do not intend . to mix up motive power with secondary machinery. Item  162,  I repeat, deals with motive power. I hope that the honorable member will not move the amendment. I do not know whether the  Chairman  thinks it can Le moved, but I think that we shall have to recommit item 162 before anything can be done in that regard. </para>

                        <para>-  On a point of order, sir, I understand that we have passed motive-power machinery n.e.i. at 25 per cent., or whatever the duty is, but that we may elsewhere include any particular part of that machinery in any item. The Tariff has been dealt with throughout on the understanding that the term &#34;n.e.i.&#34; means &#34;not elsewhere in the Tariff included,&#34; and does not mean &#34;not elsewhere in this item included.&#34; If you, sir, look through the other items in the same way, you have to look through a number of different divisions to see what the term &#34; n.e.i.&#34; means. I wish to have a ruling, because it will govern, not merely the amendment which the honorable member for Capricornia wishes to move, but many others. </para>

                        <para>-  I understand that, but it certainly would be included in the general term &#34; machinery &#34; if it did not happen to have been already dealt with as motive-power machinery. I contend that the proposed amendment is relevant to the item with which we are dealing. Suppose that motive-power .machinery had not been dealt with, then the proposed amendment of the honorable member ought to be quite in order, because he says, &#34; We are dealing with machinery generally, and I want to include . under the head of machinery admitted at 5 per cent., one kind, namely, a high-speed engine.&#34; As against that, it is said, &#34; Oh, but that particular kind of machinery comes under motive-power machinery, with which we have already dealt.&#34; I submit that we have dealt with only motive-power machinery n.e.i., and in order to find out whether that fact prevents us from dealing with the insertion of high-speed engines here we have to ascertain what the term &#34;n.e.i.&#34; means. I hold that it means motive-power machinery not elsewhere included in the Tariff. If that is the meaning of the term, it is left open to the honorable member to include the article anywhere else in the Tariff. </para>

If it applied throughout the Tariff, then under groceries, textiles, or any other head, honorable members could drag in. certain items already dealt with, and deal with them again, and there would be no finality to our dealing with the Tariff. As it stands now, item 162 refers to specific articles, and the term n.e.i. in the item includes similar articles not elsewhere included in the item. </para>

I point out to the honorable member that if his contention is correct, then every item with which we have dealt in the way of machinery could be repeated so that there would be no finality in our dealing with the Tariff. I am not here to decide what a turbo blower or high-speed engine is. I can only be guided by the Minister and honorable members.. The Treasurer has stated that a high-speed engine is a motive power. My interpretation is that it comes tinder paragraph b - n.e.i. - of item 162, and that its insertion in 164 cannot be moved. </para>

It defines the term as meaning &#34; not elsewhere included.&#34; If there is only one &#34; n.e.i.&#34; item attached to machinery, it is clear that all machinery not specified falls under it. But if there is another &#34; n.e.i.&#34; item connected with steam machinery there may be some confusion. </para>

Other machinery of any kind not elsewhere mentioned in any part of the Tariff would be dutiable at the- rates set out in paragraph b. Any other interpretation would entirely change our Customs administration.

                        <para>.- I regard the new grouping proposed by the Minister as admirable. The honorable member for Parramatta has asked why the engineering establishments of Victoria and New South Wales do not make the pulley-blocks and travelling blocks specified in paragraph  a  of item 164. As a matter of fact, these are wood-split pulleys, and are not made in engineering establishments. But as. they are largely used in such establishments, they should be -dutiable at as low a rate as possible. </para>

                            <para>- I have already pointed out that, in my opinion, there should be no differentiation between steam turbines and high-speed engines-. Both are made in  highly specialized British engineering establishments, Great Britain making better machines of this kind than are made elsewhere in the world. But both kinds of machine should be treated alike. If one is dutiable at 5 per cent., the other should be so too, while, if one is made dutiable at 20 per cent., the other should be dutiable at that rate. It seems a gross anomaly to put a steam turbine at 5 per cent., and a high-speed engine at 20- per cent. Both should pay either 20 per cent, or .5 per cent. The honorable member for Capricornia has referred to the turbo-blower. It seems an anomaly that the turbine which supplies the motive power should be separated in this Tariff from the turbo-blower, which is screwed on to the blower, and finishes the work. The honorable member was quite right in his desire to have high-speed engines placed on the same basis as turbo-blowers. Certainly it is anomalous that a turbine should pay 5 per cent., whilst in another part of the Tariff it is provided that an engine doing similar work should pay 20 per cent. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. The honorable member for Capricornia has lost his opportunity of moving an amendment. The matter should, have been dealt with in connexion with item 162. But surely the Treasurer is not going to allow this Tariff to be passed with these anomalies upon its face. I ask him to put both -on either the 20 per cent, list or the 5 per cent, list. Personally, I should prefer that both paid 20 per cent. I do not know whether the Treasurer .has provided for every exemption that it is desirable to provide for. There are other industries affected by this Tariff whose tools of trade are not exempted at all. I resisted efforts to get the tools and machinery of the hat-making industry placed on the exempt list; and why should I vote for a high duty for the benefit of the engineering trade, and not for a duty for the benefit of the tool maker? The engineering people&#39; have no greater right to have their tools exempt than have those engaged in other industries. As to pulley blocks and travelling blocks, I was under the impression that those terms covered wood split pulleys. But is that so ? </para>

                            <para>- Under the old Tariff wood split pulleys paid 12ft per cent. It can be reasonably urged that they cannot be produced here, because they are manufactured from a special kind of wood grown in Canada and the United States. There is no room for granting preference to Great Britain in this case, because they are not made in Great Britain. To make them free so far as the United Kingdom is concerned is a very empty concession indeed. I hope that the Treasurer will give no undue preference to the engineering trade. If those engaged in it receive Tariff assistance, they should be prepared to give proper Tariff assistance to those who make their tools. I should be the last to ask for a concession of the kind if I were connected with the industry. Personally, I think that iron pulley blocks and travelling blocks ought to be made in the country. Why should not the pulley maker have as much assistance as others? </para>

                            <para>- At any rate, it affects the rate at which an article is to be dutiable. If it means not elsewhere included in item 164, it means that all machines, except those mentioned in paragraph a will pay 30 or 25 per cent&#39;. But there are other machines mentioned in other parts of the Tariff which are dutiable at different rates. For instance, in item 166, &#34;machinery and machines and machine tools,&#34; there are a number of machines which are dutiable at 25 and 20 per cent. If &#34; n.e.i.&#34; applies to the whole Tariff, it is all right, but if it applies only to item 164 its effect will be absolutely contradictory. I have no wish to confuse the Treasurer, but I should like to have an explanation. </para>

                            <para>- I fail to see how the Department could determine what rate of duty should be paid without this classification. The machines and machinery included in other groups are specified, but that is not the case so far as paragraph  b  of this item is concerned. -As to paragraph  a,  I would remind the Committee that there are two kinds of pulley blocks, the one made of wood, and the other of metal, but the iron pulley is more generally used, and is found to be more serviceable than is the wooden article. I am pleased that pulley blocks are to be placed in the group dutiable at 5 per cent., because in all probability a larger revenue will be obtained in this way than would be secured if a higher duty were imposed upon them. The Government propose that machines and machinery n.e.i. coming under this item shall be dutiable at 30 per cent. I would point out, however, that at the most the duty should not be more than 20 per cent., since that is the duty imposed under item 162. As both items relate to the same class of machinery the duty in each case should be the same. </para>

                        <para>.- I should be glad if the Treasurer would explain why it is proposed to place pulley blocks and travelling blocks from Great Britain on the free list? Under .the old Tariff metal pulley blocks with shafts were dutiable at 20 per cent., and subsequently, under Customs administration, at i2| per cent., whilst pulley blocks of wood were also- dutiable at the same rate. I never heard it  suggested to- the Tariff Commission that metal or wooden pulley blocks should be placed on the free list. Any ordinary blacksmith can make metal pulleys. Surely the advocates of the Western Australian mines are not reduced to the sorry plight of having to ask that pulley blocks shall be placed on the free list.&#34; I feel satisfied that the -honorable member for Kalgoorlie does not wish them to be so treated. </para>

The proposed rearrangement was recommended by those gentlemen after consultation with the Department. I am informed that pulley blocks cannot be commercially made here. We have .already placed chains on the free list, and I am sure that the honorable member for Bendigo would not expect me to inquire personally into all the details of every item, and to be able to say, as the result of personal investigation, whether pulley blocks can or cannot be made here. I give instructions to the officers in the Department to do certain things. </para>

If I can say of my own knowledge that a proposal is wrong, I alter it. I do not know of any establishment where pulley blocks are made. When last in Sydney I visited a ship chandler&#39;s store, with a view to making a purchase for my son, and was there informed that pulley blocks were not made in Australia. These are my reasons for including pulley blocks in this item. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. TILLEY</inline>BROWN (Indi)  &#91;8.56I-  T think that the proposal to grant a rebate in respect of the duty paid on certain machinery is most improper. The hat-making industry in some cases has been- granted the protection of a duty amounting to  150  per. cent., and yet it is proposed to allow rebate in respect of the machinery used in that industry, while, at the same time, the claims of the mining community are ignored. I am afraid to speak of the &#34; primary producer,&#34; for I notice that whenever I Jo refer to it some of the newspapers, whether it be true or not, report that my statement is received with laughter. I believe that the granting of a rebate in respect of home consumption is a most improper concession to an industry already heavily protected. If the proposal is to be accepted, its .scope should be extended. </para>

                        <para>.- I am by no means averse to the inclusion of this particular machine in paragraph a, but 1 point out that whilst this patent hoist has the advantage of an advocate in the Committee, there might be a number of other patent appliances of equal merit and importance to other industries which ought also to be on the free list. I do not think it is a proper course to adopt to specify a few particular appliances, and exclude all other machinery of a similar character. I suggest to the Minister, in the circumstances, the advisability of further amending the amendment by the addition of words which would provide for the inclusion of other patent machinery of a similar character. </para>

                            <para>- That is quite another question, and I admit that if we could discover some general term that would meet the case, it would be better than to specifically include, under a certain name, any particular article. There can be no doubt that in the interests of the mining industry, this class of hoist should be included in the free list. The most rabid protectionist cannot grumble at the inclusion of the few machines referred to in paragraph a, when they know that every other machine under this item must be admitted under the n.e.i. provision. One honorable member objected to the inclusion of pulley-blocks, but they must be regarded as the tools of trade of an immense number of persons engaged in many industries. </para>

                        <para>. - I ask the Minister whether he does not think it would be well for the Committee to be informed as to what really is to be included under paragraph b, &#34; Machines and machinery n.e.i.&#34; I do not wish to embarrass the Minister in any way, but the Committee should know what it is doing. It seems to me that we are making the minor govern the major, since a small list of minor articles are put in the forefront, and everything else undefined is included in the n.e.i. paragraph. I  am  informed that there will be included in this item, under the provision n.e.i., air-compressing machinery for hoisting and lifting, hydraulic machinery, pumping machinery, and so on. If we are to be precluded from moving the transfer of any article from one paragraph of the item to the other, and  are  not informed as to what would be included in paragraph b, it seems to me that it would be well for the Minister to &#39;submit an extended list, setting out the machinery included in both these paragraphs. I have no objection to the inclusion of the Hollman Patent Hoist in paragraph a, but it is only typical of many appliances necessary in the mining industry which are not manufactured here. In my opinion, it is not fair to specifically include a particular appliance, and leave scores of others to come in under the n.e.i. provision. I suggest that the Committee cannot intelligently deal with paragraph a until we have some information as to the articles which are to be included in both the paragraphs of this item. </para>

I am glad that the importance of the matter has forced itself upon- the attention of the Committee. I hope the Minister will be successful in inducing the Committee to include the small hoist referred to. The honorable gentleman will see that the effort he has made to systematize this item of mining machinery is likely to lead to confusion, unless there is some definite understanding as to the machinery covered by the words &#34;n.e.i.&#34; in paragraph  b.

                        <para>. - There is no reason why this amendment should be limited to Hollman patent hoists. If the name &#34;Hollman&#34; is struck out the whole difficulty will be overcome. Instead of saying vaguely that other articles should be included in paragraph  a,  the honorable member for Kooyong should specify the articles which he desires to transfer to the paragraph. If he does not do that he is only wasting the time of the Committee. I will support any honorable member who shows that it is right to place any specified article on the free list.  </para>

                        <para>. - I hope the Committee will not agree to the limitation proposed by the Treasurer. Other patent hoists should be considered as much as is a patent for &#34;hauling mullock .out of a hole.&#34; The proposed distinction is unnecessary and unfair. I do not know why the Minister persists in interpolating these irritating items. If he desired to &#34; stone-wall &#34; his own Tariff he could not do it more effectively than by making these interpolations. If some patent flour hoist comes out, is it to be penalized while a mining hoist comes in at a low rate ? </para>

If the Government will accept my suggestion, I am prepared to support them; but if they stand out for duties of 25 per cent. and 20 per cent:, I shall vote for duties of 20 per cent. and . 15 per cent. If a duty of 20 per cent. is sufficient to insure the manufacture of the articles here; I see no reason for adding 5 per cent. If 20 per cent. is not enough to insure the local manufacture, then the Government, if it be a Protectionist Government, ought to propose 25 per cent. or 30 per cent. </para>

If the hon- &#34;orable member would limit his attention to his relations with his own constituency, and allow me to look after mine, he would have quite enough &#187; to do. He is accustomed to dub every man who will not vote for the precise duty which he desires a free-trader. Is that a logical position to take up ? Why this hysterical demand for these excessive duties? It is high time that the country awoke to the fact that the demand is being made simply to enable the Government to pass on the benefit of these duties to the employes in the form of the new protection. </para>

                    <para class="block">I have had personal experience in regard to air compressors and engines, and, therefore, I have a fair idea of what can be reasonably done by our manufacturers. The best advice I cm get is that the manufacturing plants in Australia can produce satisfactory machinery up to a certain capacity, but that the limited quantity of machinery beyond that capacity which, is required is not sufficient . to justify v the enormous expenditure which has often to be incurred in order to produce a single machine of such size. I am informed that it may cost as much for patterns and designs to produce&#39; one machine as it would cost to produce six machines. According to the best information I can get, air compressors with a capacity of 1,000 cubic feet of free air per minute can drive ten or twelve drills, which, as honorable members know, is beyond the requirements of the majority of ordinary mines. We ought to make it possible for such machines to be obtained from the markets of the world. </para>

                        <para>.- In South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Felix Martin, of the Gawler Foundry, was asked his opinion about the evidence given by a Kalgoorlie mining manager to the effect that the Ingersoll-Sargent air compressor was more efficient than an Australian-made one. According to the report of the A section of the Tariff Commission, page 41, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Martin</inline> explained that -  it was all a matter of price, which varied according to the required capacity of the machine. An Ingersoll-Sergeant compressor could be got in Australia, as that company was not the only maker. He claimed that his compressor could be made as efficient as any imported one working inAustralia. </para>

                            <para>-There was no evidence given about the capacity, and that point was not taken at Kalgoorlie. Only the question of price was raised there. I have no doubt whatever that air compressor&#39;s of the capacity referred to by the honorable member can be made in some of the big engineering establishments in . South Australia, Victoria, and Queensland. The Golden. Horseshoe Mine gave to an outside firm an order for an air compressor without calling for tenders in Australia, and with reference to that order, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rigby,</inline> of the Austral Otis Company, has made this statement in a letter which he sent to me - </para>

                        <para>. -  I sincerely hope that the Committee will not agree to the amendment. At Castlemaine I have been in Thompson&#39;s up-to-date foundry, where I suppose more air compressors are turned out than are made by any other foundry in Australia. I have seen as many as five being laid down at one time. They are made there up to almost any capacity which may be used, and they are of the finest quality. </para>

                            <para>- I am very sorry that the honorable member is adopting that attitude. At Thompson&#39;s foundry, Castlemaine, I have seen these air compressors in course of construction, and I have been assured by those who use them that they are equal, if not superior, to imported air compressors. On these grounds. I ask honorable members not to agree to the amendment, but to assist us in maintaining the supremacy we have gained, and also to increase the industry. A great deal has been said in the past about the inability of local manufacturers to make these articles, but any honorable member who will visit Thompson&#39;s foundry at Castlemaine will, I feel sure, find one or more of these air compressors in the course of construction, and also see documents in which the users of them speak in the highest terms of their efficiency and durability. &#39; That magnificent foundry known as Walker&#39;s Limited, Maryborough, in Queensland, also manufactures these articles, and of the highest quality too. Unless they are made well to withstand the strain which is put upon them they will not give satisfaction. We have proof that they are made to the complete satisfaction of the users, and it would be nothing short of a criminal act if we took away from the manufacturers the opportunity they have to prove that Australian workmen are equal to the best workmen&#34; whom the world can produce. </para>

                            <para>- That offer did not contain any mention of capacity. Those who know anything about mining are aware that in dealing with low-grade lodes machinery is needed such as it is not reasonable to expect to get in Australia. Evidence given before the Tariff Commission . shows that one-fifth of the cost of a piece of machinery goes in preparing preliminary plans, and it would not be fair to expect an engineering firm to undertake the expense necessary to turn out a big piece of machinery, such as . it would not be called upon to make again for a number of years. I do not know enough about the air compressors which are in use to be able to say whether the honorable member for Kalgoorlie has fixed a proper limit; but consideration should be given where machines of an exceptional size are required. When high duties are imposed on machinery which cannot be made here, a heavy tax&#39; is levied on the mining industry, without corresponding benefit to Australia. I am glad that the Minister has been able to give us some definite information. </para>

                        <para>.- When I brought forward my proposal, my only desire was to do what is fair in the interests of mining. There are not, on my information, many more than twenty air compressors of over  1,000  cubic feet capacity in the mines of Australia at the present time. A compressor which will deal with  1,006  cubic feet of free air per minute can drive ten three-inch cylinder rock drills, and not many mines use so many drills at one time. When a mining proposition has to deal with a large quantity of low-grade ore, it must - reduce its costs to a minimum. No doubt there are manufacturers in Victoria who would proclaim their ability to make any machinery that the most fertile imagination in the Committee could conceive of. But there is such a small demand for machines of the size of which I am speaking, that it would not pay Australian manufacturers to go to the expense of making preparations, for constructing them. Of course, my statement is disputed. Any statement made&#39; on behalf . of the mining industry, no matter how substantiated by facts, is almost sure to be disputed, either by a reference to something contained in the  6,050  pages of the Tariff Commission&#39;s reports, or by the statement of the representative of a constituency in which there_ is a foundry or engineering establishment of some description. . My proposal applies to big machinery only, and there are in Australia very few of the machines which it affects. They are being used on low-grade propositions, which are being worked as economically as possible, although the men employed on them are being paid a decent rate of wages. If the amendment be agreed to, the engineering trade of Australia will not be seriously affected, because the demand for these engines is so small that local manufacturers would not find it worth their while to make them. </para>

I do not know whether the honorable member would like us to doubt the truth of his statements. I have here a photograph of a Cross Compound Air Compressor of  2,000  cubic feet capacity, capable of driving twenty drills, and designed and manufactured for the Long Tunnel mine, Walhalla, by the Austral Otis Engineering Company Limited, of South Melbourne; and another photograph of steam cylinders fitted with triple expansion valves and air cylinders, with improved Corliss air valves.

                    <para class="block">But some honorable members will not believe the statements made to them, no matter what proofs, are put before them. If they were shown these engines, they would find fault with them, unless there was the name of a foreign firm attached to them. I do not think that the honorable member for Kalgoorlie does credit to the State which he represents when he tries to make the Committee believe that Australians cannot do anything. It seems to mie that the time will come when Australians will say that they cannot have their wants made known, iri the Houses of Parliament. It is a wonder to me that the advocates of the importers, are not imported  as  well as the mechanical  contrivances needed in Australia. I hope that this  Committee will not allow the vital points of the Tariff to be picked, out so as to make the whole scheme useless. I have noticed during the debate a tendency to pick out portions of it. for special attack* I trust that the Committee will strenuously resist the attempt to eliminate air compressing engines. </para>
                    <para>Amendment of the amendment negatived.  <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. THOMAS</inline> BROWN (Calare) &#163;10.31&#93;. - I desire to speak upon item 164 before it is finally dealt with, and to refer to the manner in which the Minister&#39;s scheme is formulated. Lines are mentioned which are. placed on the free list so far as concerns the United Kingdom, and which are dutiable so far as the rest of the world is concerned. Other mining machinery of all descriptions comes under the general n.e.i. drag-net, which, by a recent vote of the Committee, has been reduced from 30 and 25 to 25 and 20 per cent. I wish to emphasize the point that a large percentage of the minerals that have to be dealt with in this country are low-grade ores. Every now and then some new method of treating such ores is discovered, which enables very large quantities to be treated successfully. &#34;Without such methods those ores could not be profitably treated. The improvements are very largely mechanical contrivances adapting electricity and chemical processes to the treatment of ores. Under the Minister&#39;s proposal no new method of that character devised outside Australia, and covered by patent rights, could be used here without the payment of royalties to the patentees in addition to taxation at the higher rate. In this way the mining industry would be seriously handicapped. I might mention as an instance the cyanide process. Prior to that process being discovered, a great quantity of low-grade stuff in the Commonwealth was unused. By the introduction of the cyanide process and the appliances connected with it, large areas of mineral country were rendered highly profitable. In my own electorate, enormous quantities of tailings from the old mining fields have been successfully treated several times, yielding a profit each time ; and on each occasion the method applied represented au improvement upon the preceding one. But under the proposal of the Minister, new mechanical appliances would be penalized by having to pay the higher scale of duties. </para>

                            <para>- The patentees would have a good deal to say as to what would have to be paid to them. The honorable member is probably aware that machines are being used in the boot factories of this city upon the rent system, by which the patentees, who refuse to sell their patent rights, secure considerable returns. If I may diverge for a moment, I take up this position in regard to patent rights : I think that we should under our law insist on the manufacture of patented machines in our midst, or that the patents should become invalid. But we have not reached that position -yet. We recognise patent rights taken out in all parts of the world. Under- this scheme, we are practically going to penalize our own people who are engaged in the mining industry in regard to the use of newer, more up-to-date, and more economical methods of treating ores. The Minister might overcome the difficulty &#39;by putting in a paragraph that would allow him to permit the introduction of new forms of machinery on the lower scale, until such time as they could be manufactured here. I quite agree that it is not wise to put too. much power in the hands of the Minister, but we have to place power somewhere, and so long as it is used in the best interests of the community, no objection can be taken to it. I point out that countries which are soaked in protection - that are not experimenting with it,, but have had practical applications of it, and are further advanced in the arts and sciences than we are - pay greater regard&#39; to&#39; their mineral development than we propose to do under this Tariff. In New Zealand, very nearly all the large machinery used in mining and mineral recovery is on the free list. The same is the case in Canada. Cyaniding plants are upon the free list there, as are a large enumeration of mechanical contrivances for the profitable treatment of mineral ores, in- ; eluding gold, silver, and iron ores. .Surely,  dependent as we. are to such a large extent upon our mineral resources for our wealth, i we ought to have a little, regard to these  interests. Whilst the total amount of wealth realized from mining is very large, it must be remembered &#39;that a great number of mining propositions are working very close . up to the paying margin,  and that even a slightly increased impost might make their operations unprofitable,  and cause them to shut down.  In these  circumstances it should be our desire to encourage, as far as possible, instead of to penalize the industry. Under the Trea- surer&#39;s proposal every new invention that  cannot be &#39; produced here, and must be  imported to facilitate mining operations, will come under the drag-net n.e.i. provision, and be liable to the higher duty. </para>

                            <para>- Yes;  1  shall not at present commit honorable members  to it ; I wish to make the matter clearer. No doubt the question will come forward after we have disposed of the Tariff, but a rebate could be granted only by direction of the House, and in cases where bulk had not been broken. Rebate cannot be granted where packages have been broken, and it is impossible to identify the machine. </para>

                        <para>.- In dealing .with . item 164, we are, by inference, dealing also with item 166 as the footnote to which the honorable member for Flinders has referred applies to both of them. The Minister has said that that footnote is not to be read into this item, but the fact that we may have later on to consider the schedule to which it refers may influence the votes of honorable members. </para>

                        <para>. - I should be glad if the Treasurer would adopt the suggestion that I made a few minutes ago. Earlier in the evening he moved to insert in paragraph  a  a patent hoist, which at the last moment had been brought under his notice, and which he said could not be manufactured here. Can he &#34;not see his way to introduce a new&#39; paragraph covering other inventions important to the mining industry that mav hereafter be brought under his notice, and which in the absence of such a provision would be subjected to the high duty relating to &#34; Machines and Machinery n.e.i.&#34; The action taken by the Treasurer earlier in the evening shows that he is in sympathy with my suggestion, and  I  hope that he will adopt it. </para>

It seems to me that, in any event, that procedure would have to be followed.  I  do not think that honorable members would agree to allow the Government to say what should be free and what should be dutiable. .My experience . is that the &#39; House is very jealous of its privileges in that regard.  I  am often told that as  I  am a protectionist  I  would, if left to myself, impose protective duties upon many articles. In the same way it might be said that a freetrade Minister would be. disposed . to put articles on the free list. </para>

                            <para>- The Treasurer must see that there would be such a small demand for machinery of this kind that no&#39; manufacturer would be warranted in importing the special appliances necessary to make these tanners&#39; machines in the. Commonwealth.  Manufacturers in America have a population of 80,000,000 or 90.000,000 of people to provide for, and they have the&#39; very best machinery for treating leather. A few days ago the Treasurer was talking to me about a splitting machine. &#39; I know the machine - referred to.. It is  an, American Band- machine, and it is possible with if to cut a hide right&#34; through into two or three thicknesses. It is a comparatively recent invention. There was a Union machine -in use prior to the discovery of the Band machine, by which only one layer could be taken off a hide. Cut in this way the leather would, of course, be inferior, but there is a demand for this kind of leather in the manufacture of boots and shoes, and Australian manufacturers are at a disadvantage so long as our tanners and curriers are unable to obtain the machine to which- I refer. I may have something further to say when I have heard the Minister on the subject. </para>

I am in receipt of a letter from&#39; some tanners &#39;in New South&#39; Wales, in which they express themselves as being ready to pay a duty upon their machinery so long as other machinery is treated in the same way. That is a reasonable attitude to take up. I shall vote against the Government&#39;s proposal. </para>
