The Government have always taken up the position that they should not "insure their property. What I think we should do is to establish an insurance fund for the purpose of meeting such risks. </para>

                        <para>- There is no news of any recent date. The question was considered, I should think two years ago, when it appeared to be believed that there was no power to transfer the island, although certain property on it might be sold. However, we called attention at that time to the risk which was being run, and I think that the Pacific Cable Board, which has a station there, must have kept itself informed of the progress of events. </para>

                        <para>- As honorable members know, it is not intended that this division of the Tariff shall come into operation until some time hence. The Manufactures Encouragement Bill hinges on this division. It is very likely that when the Bill is submitted, I shall alter the dates as to the running of the bounties. If that Bill is passed - and I hope that it will be passed - it will operate for a certain period, and I do not think it will be very long before either <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandford</inline> or some other person will have sufficiently established an industry to warrant the Government in issuing a proclamation to bring into force this division of the Tariff. Had I thought of it before, I think I should have proposed to increase the duties under Division  VIA. </para>

                        <para>- Only in one case, and very slightly. I think they ought to be 25 and 20 per cent. in comparison with the duties 011 other items in the Tariff. However, that is a matter which I am not going to deal with at the present stage. The alteration will be in plenty of time four and five years hence- which period will, I expect, elapse before these duties will come into operation. They will not operate in the meantime. I intend to propose to delete the paragraph  f -  spelter. From the information which I have been able to gather, I do not think that there is any necessity at the present time to retain that duty. It is being produced at Cockle Creek, and there is no doubt that there is a considerable demand for it in Australia. I am informed that there is a market for the whole of the spelter that can be made here. I do not think that there is any occasion to go out of our way to impose a duty at the present time; though I may change my opinion if I receive further information. I wish to say that I regard these duties as the most important in the Tariff. Iron and steel are the base of all manufactures in Australia. If we can produce enough iron and steel to supply Australia without the importation of any large quantity we shall be laying the foundation of one of the greatest industries -  probably the greatest of all - in. this country. I believe that honorable members will feel that it is absolutely necessary to carry these duties into effect. I am not asking for increased duties at present, because I believe that those proposed will be sufficient for the purpose, and also because I desire to finish the Tariff before Christmas. </para>

                        <para>- The bounty ceases when the duty comes into operation. The two do not run together. The honorable member will find that the heading to the division provides that the matter is to be dealt with in a certain way. I do not know whether it is wise to discuss that question now, as the heading has been postponed. But certain: words have been left out of the heading as it formerly stood, to the effect that a vote of both Houses of Parliament is required before the duties come into operation, Strong objection has been taken to that provision by those who wish to invest their capital in the iron and steel industry. In this Tariff we are proposing to leave the responsibility ' of bringing the duties into operation to the Minister of the day, </para>

                        <para>- The Treasurer indicated that he was going to oppose the policy which my amendment embodies. I have consistently expressed my belief that we should ardently endeavour to establish the iron industry in Australia. But I am not prepared to say at the present moment what duty I shall support. I do feel, however, that it should be distinctly stated in the Tariff that the bounty and the duty are not to be concurrent. Personally, I believe that the manufacturers would prefer a duty to the bounty, and I have already indicated that, in my opinion, the Manufactures Encouragement Bill has a very precarious career in front of it. I shall discuss the details at greater length on a future occasion, simply contenting myself now with expressing the opinion that we should have a specific declaration in the Tariff, that if duties are agreed to by the Committee, they should not be concurrent with the bounty to be paid under the Manufactures Encouragement Bill. </para>

                    <para>-- 1 take it that the only matter before us now is whether we are in favour of duties being imposed under item 229, after the iron industry has been sufficiently established in Australia. I wish to say, at the outset, that m dealing with the subject as I shall do, I do not desire to reflect upon any Minister. I do not agree with the honorable member for Kooyong that the manufacturers would prefer a duty to a bounty. With the exception of those who were only turning out iron I do not think that manufacturers would prefer a duty to a bounty, and cannot understand the honorable member suggesting that they would. </para>

                        <para>- Naturally, if there were only one manufacturer of iron, he would prefer a duty to a bounty; but every user of iron would be of a different opinion. For that reason I think that the granting of a bounty is a much better method of encouraging the industry than is the imposition of a duty. I am not averse ' to a duty being imposed if the industry is established. The creation of the industry would more than compensate for any drawback that might arise from the collection of such duties as these. </para>

I am prepared to support these proposals, but do not think there should be any lengthy debate upon them. When we have  to deal with the material question of whether the Minister shall have power by proclamation to direct duties on metals and machinery to be collected, or whether such a direction should be given only by Parliament, which alone has the power to impose duties', I shall be found objecting to the first-named proposal. </para>

On three prior occasions we have had under consideration a schedule of this kind, and in the last instance we varied the heading, using words similar to, if not exactly the same, as those now under consideration. In the Tariff of 1902, it was provided that the duties should come into operation by a resolution passed by both Houses of the Parliament. I have been advised all round, however, that the uncertainty attaching to such a provision would militate against the establishment of the industry. </para>

                        <para>- I hope the honorable member will not grumble. Under the Manufactures Encouragement Bill, up to the 1st January, 191.3, a certain sum of money will annually be expended by way of bounties on the production of pig iron. If at that time, or before the expiration of that time, it appeared to the Ministry that the production of pig iron in Australia. was sufficient to supply the requirements of the Commonwealth then, under this proposal a proclamation could be issued providing that the duty of i2| per cent, should. come into operation. As soon as the duty comes into operation, the bounty will cease. I wish at once to disabuse the minds of honorable members as to there being any desire on the part of the Government that the duty and the bounty shall be concurrent. </para>

                        <para>- I speak as I feel in regard "to this matter ; and I recognise that there is a difference of opinion on the subject. If it be decided that these duties shall not come into operation except upon a resolution of both Houses of Parliament, I shall have to submit to that decision;; but I think that such a condition would hamper the investment of money in the industry, and that it would be better to adopt the Government proposal. We use the words "sufficiently established." The question of how best to express our intentions in this regard has always been a troublesome .one; even when the right honorable member for Adelaide was Minister of Trade and Customs great difficulty was experienced in determining what would be the most suitable words to use as a direction to the Minister. On one occasion it was proposed that the duties should come into operation when it was shown that sufficient pig iron was produced to supply Australian requirements. </para>

If we could induce any person to produce a sufficient  quantity  of pie iron to meet Australian demands, there would be no difficulty in inducing them to take up the processes of converting the pig iron into the other forms of iron upon which they would afterwards be able to obtain the advantage of the duties set out in item 229. </para>

                        <para>- Let me further say that if the Minister will at once say that he is prepared to leave the matter to Parliament I shall withdraw the amendment, and let him propose the necessary alteration, as I have no special desire to be personally associated with the amendment of the proposal. I think the Minister must admit that the feeling of the Committee is against so great a change as he proposes. Honorable members are noW at all likely to agree that it should be left to the discretion of the Minister to say when the industry has been sufficiently ' .established. That would be an enormous power to place in the hands of any Minister or Government. The question at issue is certainly one upon which honorable members should have an opportunity of expressing an opinion. </para>

Listening to the Minister I began to wonder whether we were not approaching a similar condition of things to that existing at the the present time in Portugal, where Parliament has been altogether dispensed with. </para>

                        <para>- The cases are very different. I hope the Committee will not agree to the Minister's proposal. It seems to me to be a distinct step towards personal government, which I hope will never be adopted in Australia. It would be a sorry day for the democracy if we gave these ' large' powers affecting the vitals of our form of government into the hands of any Ministry or Cabinet except in the most urgent circumstances. </para>

                        <para>- I should not think so. When I first looked at the proposal I wondered if it had been submitted for the purpose of protecting the revenue. I have not heard the Minister say anything about that phase of the question. 1 take it that if the Cabinet did arrive at the conclusion that any of these industries were sufficiently established to warrant the imposition of the duties, it would be their duty to bring down a schedule of the duties in the ordinary way, imposing them at the same time. That would be necessary for the protection of the revenue. I do not think we should loose our hold of the right to consider the matter <inline font-style="italic">de novo</inline> when that time arrives. I should like to direct the attention of the Minister to two or three of these items. Paragraph a includes scrap iron and steel and pig iron. Paragraph b includes ingots, blooms, slabs, billets, puddled bars and loops, or like crude manufactures, less finished than iron or steel bars, but more advanced than pig iron. Then, in paragraph c we have bar, rod, angle, tee, plain, sheet and plate, wire and hoop. </para>

                        <para>- Unfortunately, if a Minister makes a mistake, Parliament is exceedingly generous and stands bv him. But that is not the point. This idea of the Government proceeding by proclamation, is an old. familiar friend. Every Government and  every  member desires to have the power to control Parliament. Perhaps there is not a member in this Chamber who would not do so if he were given the power - and I suppose those of us with the least ability would desire it most. The Treasurer said that if Parliament reserved this power to itself, speculators or business men might hesitate to put their money into an industry. But why should they be afraid of Parliament? What Ministry would hesitate to bring down a motion- if they thought- that an industry was sufficiently established for the duties to be imposed ? </para>

                        <para>- No Ministry would be afraid to ask Parliament to impose the duties if they thought the industry had been established. If any Ministry were afraid, it would be the duty of Parliament to obtain another Ministry that would not be afraid. I do not impugn the motives or integrity of Ministers. One of the worst features of our democratic form of government is to be found in the suggestions that are sometimes made against the probity of Ministers. That is a bad thing. I do not think that that accusation can be made at all. There is no reason why Ministers should have cast upon them such' a responsibility as is proposed. A democratic Parliament should hesitate to hand over any of its powers to any Minister or Ministry. I trust the Committee will in no way bind itself by agreeing to a provision of this kind. Why should we bind Parliament for the two, three, four, or five years of which the Minister spoke? It must be obvious" to the Minister that his difficulty in that direction will be increased by the length of time which may elapse before the proclamation is brought into operation. There is no reason why Parliament should not retain this power, even if the Minister's arguments were sound, because this Parliament is sitting, and appears to be destined to sit, for at least two-thirds of the year. </para>

He still persists in fighting for his proposal in this case, although he knows the sense of the Committee is absolutely opposed to it. This is the third proposal of the kind that  I  have opposed, and   I  hope it will be the last that will be submitted to us. </para>

The Treasurer stated that if the Committee were against him, he would not push his proposal. If he has ascertained the feeling ot the Committee, I do not wish to debate the matter any longer, as I desire to save time. But I wish . to have an amendment made prior to that proposed by the honorable member for Kooyong in order to make it clear that what the Minister said was his intention will be the law.

                        <para>- The Treasurer cannot complain that I keep the talk going, but I wish to ask a question with a view to clearing up another matter which is left in a little uncertainty in this provision. It is quite possible, under its language, that we may have a proclamation referring to pig iron, or to ingots and blooms. I may be wrong, but, as I understand it, the object of the proclamation is to indicate that the Government have made up their mind that the iron and steel industry has got on to a sufficiently firm footing to do without a bounty, and to do with a duty. </para>

                    <para>. - This seems a rather roundabout way of proceeding with the whole matter. It is the clear intention of the Committee, I believe, not to indulge, in any double banking by way of both bounty and duty. If we dispose of the Manufactures Encouragement Bill in some way or other soon, we might very well simplify the whole .procedure.

                        <para>-  All I am endeavouring to arrive at now is the policy of the Government ; whether or not we agree with the policy. Then I think that the heading is accurate. If the Manufactures Encouragement Bill does not pass both Houses of the Legislature, it is the policy of the Government to bring into operation both Divisions VIa. and VIb. of the Tariff. But if,  on  the contrary, that, measure becomes .law, in that case until Division VIa. is brought into force by proclamation VIB. will not be operative. The bounty will be operative. The manufacturers of the metals specified in VIb. will not require any additional protection because their raw materials will not be taxed. Therefore, during that period, Division VIB. will not be operative any more than will Division VIa. But as soon as the bounty ceases, and Division VIa. is ' made operative by proclamation, Division VIb. must be brought into force - just as if the Manufactures Encouragement Bill had not been passed - iri order to protect those manufacturers of metals whose raw mate- rials will be rendered more expensive by reason of the operation of the provisions of Division VIa. </para>

                        <para>- Division VIb. will not come into force at all if the Manufactures Encouragement Bill is agreed to by Parliament., and if that measure has the effect of causing the production of all that we require in the shape of pig iron and other raw materials for the manufactures of this country. The object of inserting that division in the Tariff was to make the necessary provision in the event of the Manufactures Encouragement Bill being rejected, and a duty being imposed upon pig iron. It must be obvious to honorable members that the operation of such a duty would increase the price of pig iron to the manufacturers of machinery until such time as we were producing sufficient pig iron to supply their requirements. But the moment that we produce sufficient to supply their needs we shall need only to retain the duty upon their raw material. </para>

                        <para>- I  agree with the honorable member for Flinders, that this division was inserted with a view to assisting those connected with the manufacture of iron. As soon as Division  VIa.  comes into operation, Division VIb., unless we make a different arrangement, will automatically' take effect, and will place the importers and users of iron in a very difficult position. However,  I  understand from the Minister that he will omit Division VIB. if the Manufactures Encouragement Bill is passed, and that the matter will come up again for consideration at the end of the Tariff discussion. </para>

                    <para>.- Most of the dressings included in this item are the raw materials of manufacturers. Dressings, pastes, and polishes for leather are used almost entirely by boot manufacturers in preparing their goods for the market,  while bronzing and metal liquids, which are not made in this country, being solvents for converting gold and bronze powders into paint for decorative purposes, are used mainly by decorators, who get no protection from the Tariff.  I  have received a letter from a business firm which says - </para>

                    <para class="block"> The item that affects us very, seriously is Division VH., item 230, which reads - "Blackking, including all dressings, paste and polishes for leather, 40 per cent." We may mention that we introduced a scientific preparation for belt- 1 ing from America about ten years ago, and after some difficulty, have worked up a moderate business. The value of the importations, however, amount to ^500 a year, and from what we can learn, they come under the heading already mentioned, although there is another item in the same Division, 233 - cling surface being really a belt grease - under which it could be classed ; but with our knowledge of the Customs Department, having previously paid 20 per cent., it is  evident  that 40 per cent, would be claimed. </para>

                        <para>- I intend to move a reduction ; but I hope that honorable members will allow me to put the matter in my own way. The figures I have quoted have been compiled from an invoice of goods which arrived in the <inline font-style="italic">Star of Scotland,</inline> and the charges are equal to 51^ per cent, on the Home cost. The figures show, I think, that the proposed duty is very much too high. I find that before the Tariff Commission <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Belcher,-</inline> of Adelaide, stated that he had been in business for only four or five months, and was. doing a fair trade, considering that he had just started. He wanted the duty to keep imports out of the market. The duty asked for, he admitted, was high ; but he would ask for a higher one if he thought that he would get it. He wanted the duty because he desired to get a higher price. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Spooner,</inline> of Melbourne, complained that the boot manufacturers would not take his goods through prejudice, but nevertheless the American price had fallen. He wanted a duty because the price of the imported article was lower than his price, and he represented that his product would be bought if the price of imported polish were doubled. </para>

                <para class="block">That disposes of the contention of the Treasurer that on several occasions the effect of a duty is really to reduce the price of the local article. In this case the manufacturers of the local article distinctly state that their object in asking for the duty is to shut out the importations, so -that they can double their own prices. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Spooner</inline> said that he did a large trade with New Zealand and sold f.o.b. there at a lower price than he charged buyers in the Commonwealth. I have made those references to the evidence to show the purpose of those who are asking for the duty, and to point out that, on their own admissions, they are doing very well indeed. </para>

                        <para>- I resent that interjection as wholly unwarranted, and contrary to fact. Importers who reside amongst us are not foreigners any more than are manufacturers who reside here. The same thing is done by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> with his harvesters. He charges the foreigner far, less for his machines than he charges the Australian farmer. It is done here, the same as it is done elsewhere. In almost all cases the local manufacturers charge the consumers in the countries to which they export their goods less than they charge the consumers in this country. That appears to be a general practice. I presume that when they do sell their goods at a lower price to outside persons they do not sell them at a loss, but at a profit. </para>

                    <para>. - Before the honorable member for Lang submits an amendment, I wish to mention that it is the intention of the Government to see whether it is not possible to arrive at some method under which the duty shall not be charged on packages which are not worth anything, and shall only be charged on packages which are of some commercial value. That seems to me to be a fair way of dealing with the matter. . </para>

                        <para>- It seems to me that when any person imports rubbish round a package which is of no value, it is not fair to charge a duty on that rubbish. On the value of the package the duty should be paid. Wooden packages may come into competition with various things; but I think it is fair to do as I have indicated. When I was in -control of the Department I thought it was ridiculous to charge duty on something which was of no value. In a great many cases the packages are of no value. I have thrown out that suggestion to the Committee, because it may influence the honorable member for Lang in regard to something which he is proposing to do. </para>

                        <para>- The percentage is in creasing every year. Since 1904 the imports have increased over 50 per cent. In three years their value has increased from £41,180 to , £63,861, with the result that the home trade has fallen off. Of course, the £63,861 would represent a warehouse cost of no less than £80,000. The foreigner has secured seven-eighths of the trade. Undoubtedly the Nugget Polishing Company Limited are the largest exporters of this class of material from the United Kingdom to Australia. I hold in my hand a copy of their wholesale export price lists. The wholesale price list quotes waterproof black or brown polish in sixpenny tins at 3s. per dozen. That is the price of the ordinary small tin which is well known to honorable members. On the back of this list I find the conditions of sale to the retail trade. It says - </para>

                    <para>Dear Sirs,</para>
                    <para>Concerning the prices sold to the retailers for Nugget Polish three years ago and the present day, we beg to make the following report, which the writer has investigated. Three years ago it was 4s. per dozen, and then it came down to 3s.9d., and 3s. 6d., and retailed at 6d. per tin. The lowest wholesale price to-day is 37s. 6d., or 38s. 6d., less 2½ percent. for parcels, and the retail price at the present time in the boot shops is 3½d. and 3d., and in some of the up country towns the line is retailed at 2d. per tin. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">The retailers in Great Britain are compelled to sell at  4½d.  per tin. Here, to enable the market to be swamped, they sell at as low as  2d.  per tin. When the importers attain their object, they will no doubt do what they did before we had the local competition. They used to sell at 9d. and1s. per bottle, but when the local men began to compete the price was reduced to  6d.  The importers are naturally anxious to capture the market. If they succeed, the price will undoubtedly go up. I have here dozens of letters obtained from retailers in Melbourne to show the price of the article in former years and at present. </para>

                        <para>- I allude to Nugget Boot Polish, which represents more than  50  per cent. of the imports in this line. I will guarantee that for every tin of any other imported stuff which the honorable member can find in the shops in any of our leading streets, he will find a dozen tins of Nugget. I am very glad that there has been no detraction of the Australian article in the matter of quality, and, on the other hand, I point out that I am not saying a word against the quality of the imported stuff. What I maintain is, that the Australian polish is as good as any and that the local makers can turn out all the goods we require. </para>

                        <para>- There is no doubt at all about that. I have not spoken more than three or four times upon this Tariff, but when I find that this English firm is prepared to sell at  25  per cent. less for export, so as to capture our market, I think I am justified in bringing the facts prominently under the notice of the Committee. On former occasions when I have spoken I have been fairly successful, and I hope that I shall do the same on the present occasion. I intend to prove up to the hilt that the price of polish has been enormously cheapened in consequence of the local competition.

                        <para>- I trust that the Government will agree to a fixed duty, so that it will operate fairly, whether the stuff is imported in ounce,  2-oz.,  or  4-oz.  tins, or in bulk. Another document before me shows that in  1907  Nugget Polish was sold in one shop at  3½d.  per tin, and for  2½d.  at Harris's, Elizabeth-street. The same stuff cannot be purchased in Great Britain for less than double those amounts. Only last week, in my own electorate, tins were purchased at the rate of two for  6d.  - that is,  33  per cent. less than the price for which the same goods can be bought in Great Britain. Surely we have a right to protect our own manufacturers against competition like that. </para>

It has to be remembered that the local manufacturer is now paying increased prices for such of his raw materials as are not produced in Australia. Under the new Tariff, he has to pay 2s. 6d. per lb. for his egg albumen, whereas under the old Tariff the article was free. Why did not the honorable member for Lang object to a duty on eggs? </para>

I have figures before me which show how the trade of one of our manufacturers has gone down consequent upon the dumping of goods from abroad. </para>

                        <para>- I will take the honorable member's word for it. At any rate, the trade of this man's firm has decreased, as he is willing to prove from his own books. They show that from May, 1903, to April, 1904, his total trade was £10,614. But it decreased to <inline font-style="italic">£5,131</inline> from May, 1906, to April, 1907. Those figures show a decrease of 50 per cent. While that trade was being diminished, the trade of the importers was growing. I believe that the honorable member for Kooying, who is familiar with the facts, is prepared to support me in this matter. He has gone into the case for himself, and honorable members know that he would not support a duty unless he believed that it was equitable. </para>

                    <para>.- The burden of the argument of the honorable member for Yarra especially affected boot polish. He has been trying to show the Committee how a duty acts in two diametrically opposite ways. The effect of a duty on boot polish will be, he says, to cheapen prices, while the effect of a duty on the things which enter into the manufacture of boot polish is to increase prices. So that we have two antithetical objects attained by a duty - it raises prices and it reduces prices. Surely the honorable member does not ask the Committee to believe that the effect of duties on articles' which are manufactured here will be to reduce the prices of those articles, in view of the fact that in their own evidence the manufacturers point out that one of the objects they have in view in asking for a duty is to increase prices because the prices against which they have to compete are so low? The honorable member urges that the effect of a duty will be to lower prices, whilst at the same time he emphasizes the fact that the effect of duties upon the raw material from which boot polish' is made has been to increase them. The honorable member asks us to believe that a duty will at one and the same time reduce and increase prices. It was my intention to move that the duties be reduced to 20 per cent, and 15 per cent., but in view of the statement made by the Treasurer that he proposes to make some allowance in the matter of cases, which have practically no commercial value, I intend at a later stage to move that the duties be reduced to 25 per cent, and 20 per cent. They would thus be brought down to the level of the old duties. Before doing so, however, I intend to ask the Committee to eliminate the words "bronzing and metal liquids." These solvents, which are used in the manufacture of bronzes for painting purposes, are not manufactured here. I move - </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Yarra has made a. thorough explanation of the position of the local manufacturers, and I am disposed to think from the facts that he has submitted: to the Committee that my brief is very similar to that which he holds. I am satisfied that a factory at Richmond is practically idle as the result of imported brands being sold, for the purpose of destroying the local industry, at prices considerably below those at which they  are offered in England. I wish to emphasize the point made by the honorable member for Yarra that the importation of materials of this kind into Victoria considerably increased under what, as compared with the State Tariff was the low duty embodied! in the first Federal Tariff. In  1901  the imports into this State were of the value of  £5,155i  in T9°4 they had increased in value <inline font-style="italic">to £12&gt;34i,</inline> in i9°S t0 <inline font-style="italic">£15, 248,</inline> and in  1906  to  ^19,698.  I would also remind, the Minister that the question qf casings: is an important consideration in determining what is a fair  dutv  to impose. Blackings and polishes of excellent quality are being; made here, and the industry would flourish but for the efforts of those who are adopting the' tactics to which I have referred. <inline font-style="italic">T</inline> am satisfied that, in the special circumstances, even what might be regarded as an extravagant <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty would not meet the case. </para>

                        <para>- The Question of preference has not been considered. The whole of the manufacturers have signed a petition urging that the duties I have mentioned be imposed. Th'ey have cut down their request to the very lowest level compatible with their being able to keep their works going. ' Like the honorable member for Yarra, I know that the * factory in Richmond was started with sufficient .capital by capable men who knew their business, but they have been unable to cope with the competition I have mentioned. It is with a knowledge of the <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> of the representations that have been made that I urge that a fixed duty would be preferable to the higher <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty which the manufacturers originally hoped to secure. I shall therefore support the amendment which I understand the honorable member for Yarra intends to submit. </para>

                    <para>I intend to support the reduction of the duty to  25  per cent, on the ground first of all that such a duty plus freightage and other charges ought to be and is sufficient protection for the local manufacturers. I have some knowledge of the business done in one of the imported boot polishes now on the market. I refer to what is known as "  2  in  1."  It is used so largely in Australia that something like  £2,000  was last year paid by the importers by way of duty. I requested the parties concerned to furnish me with some information on the subject, and since the Committee has decided that duties should be imposed to encourage competition, as well as to enable local manufacturers to compete with the importers, I think that I could not do better than quote, first of all, their statement on that phase of the question - "2 in 1" shoe polish does not, as has been represented by Australasian manufacturers, compete unfairly with those friends, inasmuch as it has not been sold to distributors at a less figure than 4s. 6d. per dozen ; in fact, the majority of the sales up to the present have been made at 4s. gd. per dozen, while local manufacturers have in the past been content with, and worked successfully on, prices ranging from 2s. 3d. per dozen to 4s. per dozen. </para>

                    <para>In face of the new duty, this is hardly, possible, as it will enhance the distributing price to such an extent that the retailing of it will not show the grocer or boot-dealer a fair working margin, and they will naturally hesitate in laying in stocks of an unprofitable line to the detriment of both ourselves and the Australasian public. Our only way out of the difficulty - if the unfair duty is continued - will be to pack the line in a smaller can, thus giving the public a lesser quantity for the same money, and making the public the real sufferer. This we hesitate to do, but, as before mentioned, it is the only course left open. </para>

                <para>The company that has placed this polish on the market has been doing a large  busi-ness,  since it has paid duty amounting to  £2,000  out of a total of  £12,920  collected in respect of this item. I repeat that a duty of.  25  per cent., plus freightage and wharfage charges, should be sufficient to protect the local manufacturer. </para>

                    <para>.- The protectionist members of the Tariff Commission recommended a duty of  35  per cent, on polishes and blacking because of the fierce and intense competition to which the local manufacturers have been subjected, and also because of the suspected low invoice valuations, the prejudice that, exists against the local article, and the cutting rates in which the importers indulge. This item does not relate to a solely Victorian industry ; a start has been made in South Australia. A South Australian manufacturer complained very bitterly of the insufficiency of the duty on these goods, and asked for a duty of  50  per cent., which he said - would tend to keep competing lines out of the market, and would greatly develop the trade. The suggested duty would, the witness thought. lead to the establishment of similar industries in the other States, while not involving any increase in the price to the public..... </para>

                <para>A Victorian manufacturer of boot and leather dressings, whose business was .established under, the Tariff of that State and profitably conducted up to 1903-4, complained of the impossibility of competing against imported lines. He was recently informed of a- large sale of imported boot polish at 12s. per gross, a price actually less than the cost of the bottles, caps, and cork linings in which his polish was sold. </para>
                <para class="block">There is sworn evidence as to cutting rates and fierce competition, and there is a request for high duties. We suggested a duty of 35 per cent, because we had not the data on which to decide fixed rates of duty. I understand that a proposal has been made to substitute fixed' rates for <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties. If the Minister is satisfied that the fixed rates suggested are substantially the same as. a 35 per cent, duty, I shall have- great pleasure in voting for them. </para>

The honorable member for Bass pointed out that candles made in Melbourne were being dumped into Tasmania, and I can assure the Committee that the articles .with which we are now dealing have been dumped into Western Australia, with the result that local factories for their manufacture have been closed. The honorable member for Yarra has complained of the dumping of English manufactures into Melbourne, but he should not make such a complaint when he finds that Victorian manufacturers are guilty of the same practice. </para>

I have no wish that blacking should be admitted free, but I do not think duties of 50 per cent., 60 per cent., or 100 per cent, should be imposed on it. I should not object to the duties proposed by the Government in this instance, but I say the Minister should not deviate from the Tariff he has submitted in order to satisfy Melbourne manufacturers  every  time. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Fremantle, as a professed protectionist, should recognise that the way to prevent dumping is to induce proper competition within the Commonwealth, and that can only be secured by sufficient duties on imported goods. The honorable member should vote for the recommendations of the A section of the Tariff Commission on this occasion - I would not ask him to support a higher  duty  than they have recommended - and if he did so, he would' very  soon find that there would be sufficient competition in the business in Western Australia to prevent dumping from within or without the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member for Laanecoorie, in common with all other Victorian protectionists, claims that if duties are put up high enough internal competition will do the rest. The reply is easy and not far to seek. It has not done the rest in the case of many other goods which have been made here for many years; as witness the revelations in the harvester industry. The manufacturers were getting high prices for their goods, there was plenty of internal competition, and yet they 'were paying their employes as low as 5s. 6d. a day. </para>

                        <para>- I assume that the honorable member takes into consideration all the conditions surrounding an industry when he refers to the effect of competition. I say that dumping has not the effect attributed to it from time to time by honorable members in discussing these duties. I wish to point out that in connexion with the blacking industry a brutal frankness was exhibited by those who appeared before the Tariff Commission. One witness wanted 50 per cent, if he could get it, and had the candour to say - </para>

                <para>I should think he would. Who would not if he thought he had to deal with a Minister like the Treasurer, who would be prepared to give almost any duty which would prevent the importation of anything that could be made here? Who would not ask if he knew he would receive? Nothing could be more simple than to have an interested manufacturer give evidence before the Tariff Commission, and then to take his word without testing it in any way. The witness to whom I refer was asked what his object was in asking for a higher duty, and on this point I quote the following evidence given in answer to . question 62070 - </para>

I direct the attention of the Committee to the fact that this is the class of evidence given to the Tariff Commission throughout their inquiry. There evidently was a difficulty in obtaining evidence on behalf of the consumers of Australia. They did not offer evidence, and the Tariff Commission apparently did not deem it their duty to procure the evidence of consumers. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. We need not expect the manufacturers or importers to bother very much about the consumer. The importer knows that he can pass the duty on, and the manufacturer knows that he can take advantage of it for himself. I say therefore that, in my judgment, an obligation rested upon the Tariff Commission to secure evidence to show how the consumers would be affected as a result of the duties to be imposed. I am not impugning the honesty of manufacturers who gave evidence before the Tariff Commission. I say no more and no less than that human nature operates in them in the same way as in other people. The 'evidence submitted by' the Tariff Commission is. in the circumstances, largely valueless, as being the evidence of interested persons. </para>

                    <para>.- In reply to the remarks made by the honorable member for Indi, with respect to the polish to which he referred, I wish to inform the honorable member that the tin he produced was filled by a man who was asking for a higher duty. The honorable member is the representative of the foreign trader, and, speaking as such, he produced a tin of polish filled by an. Australian workman. The honorable member for Parramatta has just made a speech in which he has once more shifted his ground. Honorable members of the Opposition have repeatedly referred the Committee to the evidence given before the Tariff Commission, and times out of number have quoted from it. They have asked on more than one occasion that we should quote it, but now, because a manufacturer who went before the Commission asked for an increased duty, the honorable member for Parramatta says that the evidence collected by the Commission is worthless. It is sufficient for me to know that this industry, which some time ago employed fifty or sixty men, is only employing fourteen to-day. The honorable member for Indi knows that these goods are being dumped into Australia at a price which is less than that for which they can be bought wholesale in the Old Country. Only a short time ago 10,000 gross of " Nugget" were dumped into Sydney at 25s. a gross. The article is being sold to-day in the Commonwealth at a lower price than the local article, with the object of securing a monopoly of the trade by crushing the local manufacture out of existence. That is what the foreign trader always does when he gets the opportunity. I trust that honorable members who believe in supporting the recommendations of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission will do so on this occasion, and give this industry a fresh start. </para>

                        <para>- I want fixed duties, because with them we know exactly where we stand and what we are doing. Sometimes correct invoices are not supplied. The only way to get over that difficulty in all cases of this kind is to have fixed duties. Then those importing the articles know exactly what they have to pay, and we know where we are. </para>

                    <para>. - The remarks made about foreign traders and advocates for importers should cease, if it is desired to get business through. The importer is not a bit different from the manufacturer. They are practically the same individual, and a matter of chance has directed them into one occupation or the other. Each will do the best for himself, and will take all he can get. There is, therefore, no sense in constantly making statements such as I have referred to. The business of a Parliament is to see that neither of them is put in a position to take advantage of the public. The whole debate has centred round one article - the polish called "Nugget." But polishes for other purposes than dressing boots, such as polishes for harness, metals, and so on, are included in the item. If the argument with regard to " Nugget " applies in the case of boot polish, it has no reference whatever to those other polishes. The preference for " Nugget" is as between it and other British polishes. It has been said that more than half the boot polish that comes to Australia consists of "Nugget." There is evidently something in it that makes people demand it, so that it is not a question as between an Australian and a British article, but as between British and British. The proposal is to so increase the duty as to compel people to buy another article for which they have not the same liking. Another effect will be to impose a heavier duty on all the articles included in the . item, although they are not used for the same purpose. The Minister should make a statement and stop .the debate. </para>

                    <para>.- I have a request to make to the Treasurer regarding harness dressing, which is imported in bulk in large quantities. In. more than one of the States there is an industry for putting up the imported liquid harness dressing, which is brought in in bulks of from 45 to 50 gallons. Thai! industry gives employment in Australia, and I wish to ask the Minister to consent to insert a special line with a reduced duty on harness dressing when imported in casks containing over  0 gallons. </para>

                <para>The former duty was 20 per cent., and the new duty is 35 per cent, preferential, and 40 per cent, general. We import a liquid harness dressing in casks of 45 to 50 gallons, which we tin off here into pints and quarts, but principally pints. The tins for this, the printed labels to put on the tins, the wood boxes to hold one dozen tins, are all made in Melbourne, and, of course, our own employes do the work of filling, labelling, and boxing (no girls or women employed). If the duty on dressing imported in bulk were made, say, 10 per cent, less than for that imported in tins, it would give us a chance of competing with the tinned dressing - otherwise we will have to arrange to have our dressing tinned, labelled, and boxed in England, as the charges for these items will be very much less than if done here, while labour is proportionately cheaper there than here. </para>

I suggest that a protection of  30  per cent, should be given for those who manufacture the bulk liquid, but the honorable member for Bendigo will see that the industry has some right to a preferential treatment of, say,  5  or  10  per cent., seeing that, if that is not given, several men will be put out of employment in the case of that firm alone, and a lot of work which is now done in Australia will be sent away. </para>

                    <para>- The question is : Which is the more important? I do not say that this will altogether stop the dressing from being imported, but it will limit it to a special line of harness dressing, which is of great importance to the farming community, and I understand that harness dressing cannot now be made in Australia of the quality required. Whatever duty is agreed to for this item, I intend to ask afterwards that the duty shall be  10  per cent, less on harness dressing imported in casks containing not less than  40  gallons. </para>

                    <para>.- It is time that we polished this item off. I. intend to support the proposal of the Government. As to all these other individuals who want special concessions, we ought to dispense with that sort of pleading for special cases. I am altogether opposed to fixed duties, because they mean a penalty which is altogether prohibitive against the cheap article. If this business cannot succeed with a protection of  40  and  35  per cent.-, it ought to go under altogether. </para>

                <para class="block">I intend afterwards to move for a United Kingdom duty of  20  per cent. I make no secret of the fact that the figures which I now propose do not represent my idea of what the Tariff should be. If I thought I had the remotest chance of carrying it, I should move for a very much greater reduction, but I have to bear in mind that our time is limited, and that if we are to get through the Tariff we must not indulge in too many useless divisions, even for the sake of showing our weakness. If I were to propose anything less than the rate in the old Tariff, several honorable members sitting on this side would not agree to it, because they are pledged not to go below the old rate. I am therefore constrained to move this amendment, which will bring the United -Kingdom rate down to the rate in the old Tariff. </para>

                    <para>.- I rise to emphasize the speech made by the honorable member for Lang. The honorable member has moved that the duties be  25  per cent, and  20  per cent., not because he approves of such duties, but because he cannot get enough free-traders to support him in his desire to impose the old Tariff. I do not know what the ghost of John Farrell - I do not suppose you knew <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Farrell, Mr. Chairman</inline> - would say if he saw his old friend, the member for Lang, an eminent free-trader, submitting such a proposal to Parliament. It would appear, however, that the honorable member for Lang slips on polishes as I have slipped on machinery ; and my only desire is to show that I am not singular in slipping. </para>

Personally, I should have proposed a much lower duty if I were not aware of the fact that there would be no possibility of getting it carried ; and I do not desire to waste time.

                    <para>.- I think that the honorable member for Corio might have advanced some more plausible reason for desiring to exempt particular persons from the payment of this duty. I wish to know why we should differentiate between one class of consumer and another class? Personally, I would exempt all from the payment of Customs duties, but seeing that that is impossible, I am not prepared to discriminate. It is astonishing to find that the honorable member for Corio is a free-trader in respect of this item, although in regard to every other item in the Tariff he is a protectionist. </para>

                    <para>.- One very good reason which might be urged in favour of my amendment is that the honorable member for Lang is opposed to it. The adoption of my proposal would mean the employment of a number of men in printing, packing, and tinning operations. That fact in itself will be a sufficient inducement to most protectionist members of the Committee to vote for it. </para>

                    <para>. - A mistake has occurred in this item, upon which the A section of the Tariff Commission recommended a duty of 35 per cent. Representations were subsequently made to the Department that graphite could not be produced in Australia. Since the Tariff was introduced, however, abundant evidence has been forthcoming that it is produced in the Commonwealth, especially in South Australia. </para>

                    <para>.- I should like to hear some reasons advanced as to why we should levy such heavy duties upon articles which have hitherto been admitted free. Last year the total importations of the Commonwealth under this heading were valued at: less than £5,000. Are we going to impose a duty of 30 per cent, upon plumbago for the purpose of compelling everybody in the Commonwealth to use the article which is produced somewhere in South Australia? I would further point out that graphite is the raw material of other industries. </para>

                        <para>- They have turned out a considerable quantity, but, as the article has hitherto been admitted free, the industry has not proved remunerative.. The Ceylon mines are its chief competitors, and most of the plumbago used in the Commonwealth is imported from that island. Messrs. Burford and Company, who manufacture articles of which graphite forms the base, use a very considerable quantity of the locally-obtained ore. I have seen testimonials as to its character - testimonials which are now in the hands of the Treasurer. Samples of this ore have also been submitted to Messrs. Lewis and Whitty. </para>

                        <para>- The ore is used largely for moulding purposes, the object being to obtain a clean smooth face. For  that purpose, there is no doubt that the local ore is as good as any that can be obtained in the world. The company which has been mining for plumbago have found that, under existing conditions, the industry will not pay. I understand that they have asked for a duty of  £2  per ton, which would represent a slightly less <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rate than that proposed by the Treasurer. I think it would be equivalent to about  25  per cent. If we have suitable ore in Australia for the production of this material, we certainly ought to encourage the industry. Even if an additional  £2  per. ton were added to the price of the local article, its cost would be very little in excess of that of the imported article. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to point out the anomaly that we are about to create. Upon the previous item, we decided to levy a duty of  40  per cent, under the general Tariff, and of  35  per cent, under the Tariff for Great Britain. In other words, we imposed duties of  40  per cent, and  35  per cent, upon the raw materials of the leather-makers and harness-makers, who enjoy a protection of only  25  per cent, upon their finished article. Now we are asked to tax, to the tune of  30  per cent., another raw material of manufactures which are dutiable" at  25  per cent. Is there any sense in taxing raw materials at a higher rate than we do the manufactured article? The position is an absurd one. We are simply multiplying Tariff anomalies. As sure as this schedule is passed in its present form, an outcry will be raised against it by reason of the many anomalies which have been created. When we come to deal with substantial industries, the Treasurer insists that there shall be a large margin between the rate levied upon the manufactured article and that imposed upon the raw material. But, in respect of small matters, he adopts the reverse attitude. I would suggest that he should withdraw his proposal, and be content to levy very much smaller duties upon this item. </para>

                    <para>.- No protectionist member of the Committee will object to extending to this industry a fair measure of protection, especially as its raw material is obtainable in the Commonwealth. But it does seem to me that  35  per cent, is a very stiff charge to levy upon graphite, particularly in view of the fact that- it is the raw material of other industries. If the Treasurer secured a duty of  25  per cent, under the general Tariff, and of  20 per  cent, under the Tariff for the United Kingdom - seeing that the item has not previously been subjected to duty - he would be securing a very fair thing. </para>

                    <para>.- The compositions which it is proposed to make dutiable  are  not produced in this country to  any  extent, not for want of protection, but simply because the demand is so small, our annual consumption being about  600  tons only. Two or three men could produce that quantity in about a fortnight. These things are used almost wholly in connexion with some of the better castings in the manufacture of iron. The imposition of a duty will penalize certain manufactures, and will not have the effect of stimulating local production. The debate which we have had shows how ill advised it is for the Treasurer to bring down on the spur of the moment proposals which run contrary to those originally embodied in the Tariff, and I hope that in future ample notice will be given of the intention to move such amendments as have been proposed. </para>

                        <para>- Are we justified in increasing the duty So largely to obtain so small an advantage? The revenue obtained annually from the old duty, which was a heavy one, was less than £4,000, which shows how small the importation of oil in small vessels is. The proposed duty, when levied on twelve gross ot bottles of sewing machine oil, gives these results: freight, £1 15s. 4d., or 18.83 per cent. ; duty on the oil, £10 16s., or 146.93 per cent. ; duty on the bottles, £7 16s., or 106.12 per cent; in all, £20 7s. 4d., or 271.88 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- Olive, castor, and other oils come out to a certain extent, but not to a very large extent. The previous duty has evidently led to the local packing of a lm:e quantity of the oils used here. But to impose duties which with the charges come to 271 per cent, is, I think, beyond all reason. The freight amounts to 18.83 per cent., and, of course, the freight is higher on packed oil than on bulk oils; the duty on the oil amounts to 146.93 per cent., and the duty on the bottles amounts to 106.12 per cent., making a total of nearly 272 per cent. I propose to move an amendment on the first line of the item, which, if carried, will, I presume, be an indication that that reduction shall be made throughout the item. I move - </para>

                        <para>- Except in the case of olive oil, our chance of producing the raw materials is limited at the present time. The honorable member for North Sydney has submitted ' a reasonable amendment. The old duty was 6d. a dozen, and the employment of labour which the local bottling of the oils would create does not justify us in putting an additional impost upon the consumers. As the honorable member for Perth remarked the other night, the local bottling of somebody else's product in very likely somebody else's bottles is a parasitical industry. ' It has to be spread over six States. I trust that the Minister will see his way to accept the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- By imposing the duties honorable members create a vested interest in the importation of the goods. Apart altogether from the absurdity of imposing high duties to secure the mere bottling of the oils, they are encouraging their importation. With our climate and with handicrafts such as we shall develop very shortly we ought to make Australia quite self-supporting in regard to all these natural products. If, with- all the advantages which our isolation gives us, we cannot beat the world in the production of these articles, we shall be in a very bad way indeed. I hope that we shall not go on imposing duties which do not protect a manufacture as such, but protect only a minor process in connexion with some manufacture. The more we can tie the producing and the bottling of the things together the more efficiently we must necessarily make the production of them, and the better it will be for the consumer and all concerned. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that the old duty was not quite high enough, but we need not go so far as the Tariff Commission, has recommended. We want to be careful not to admit oils in bottles at a lower rate than that we propose to place on the oils and the bottles when brought in separately. That is one point which I think honorable members should keep in mind. The bottling of oils in Australia should be encouraged because it is a light, clean occupation, for girls. There is no reason why nearly the whole of the olive, castor and linseed oils should not be bottled here instead of being bottled for us abroad. I think that the honorable member for North Sydney was mistaken in what he said as to the proportion of the imports. According to his statement, the duty paid on oils imported in small packages totalled only £4,000, and that included castor oil, which is imported very largely in small bottles. </para>

                        <para>- Crosse and Blackwell and Morton, particularly the latter, still export to Australia a great quantity of castor oil. It is extra refined, and is claimed to be tasteless. It is imported very largely in small bottles, as well as bicycle and machine oils. The increased duty recommended by the A section of the Tariff Commission is rather high. I do not see why it should be fixed at more than is. </para>

                        <para>- Those are very small things. When oil is sent out in casks there is considerable waste and leakage, and the more the article is handled the greater is the cost to the consumer. It can be bottled abroad and delivered at considerably less cost to the consumer than it can be when it is sent out in bulk and put through different processes here. I remember the time in Victoria when, in order to give work, they used to employ men to dig holes in Melbourne and then fill them. That was thought to be a grand way of providing employment. The pouring of oil out of casks into bottles is very much on a par with the employment of men to dig holes only to fill them. Let us establish in this country all the industries we can. Do not let us put on duties which will increase the cost of an article without doing any good to the worker. We have agreed to give a bounty upon the production of certain oils. We have, to some extent, tried to induce persons to grow cotton and olives and other materials for the production of oil. When a duty is imposed on oil for protective purposes, it is all right. But we ought not to impose duties simply in connexion with the covering of an article. It is a poor sort of protection to charge a duty on the straw or packages in which articles are imported. Let us be fair and- square; let us put a duty on the article itself and keep it there, but do not let us say that any goods shall not be packed in any country but Australia. From a protectionist standpoint, that is not an evidence of strength, but rather a petty-minded sort of taxation of the people. </para>

The honorable member for Balaclava has stated that the bottling pf oils is' not an industry. He should remember that bottle-making in Victoria is a very considerable industry, and one which may be increased to a very large extent. Recently I visited a local factory, where I saw bottles being made. I thought it was a very good thing to see so much bottle-making carried on in the community. If the bottling of oil is encouraged, it will lead, not only to bottle-making, but also to case-making and packing. If is all these little things which go to make up a great industry. </para>

                    <para>. - May I point out to the honorable member for Bendigo that the difference in duty between bulk beer and bottled beer is 50 per cent. In this case, the difference is much more than that. The duty now proposed is an increase of 300 per cent, on the old duty. It cannot be said that an increase from 6d. per gallon on cotton-seed oil and 3id. on a lubricating oil, to 3s. per half-pint is an increase of only 50 per cent. It has been suggested to me that there ought to be a preference in favour of Great Britain in this case, and, therefore, I am willing to alter my amendment to make the duty 9d. on the general Tariff, and 6d. against the United Kingdom. May I ask, also, how far the Committee propose to go with this sort of industry? It would not involve going much further to say that we will not import refined oil, or that we will impose such a duty upon refined oil as to compel it to be refined here. </para>

                    <para>. - The bottle-making industry is concerned to some extent in the item under discussion. It is useless to impose a higher duty on the imported bottles if we allow bottles to come in free when full of liquid. I do not know whether honorable members are considering what it would mean to the trade of Australia if all the bottles in which commodities are sold were made here. In three States - Victoria, New South Wales, and South Australia - about  1,800  hands are employed in the bottle industry, and some hundreds of thousands of pounds are invested in it. The most serious competitor that the industry has to face is the bottle that is imported free with a duty on the contents. Bottle making requires the service of high class mechanics. If all the bottles used in Australia were manufactured here, there would be work for thousands more artisans. . In the first place, work would be provided in bottling commodities if they were imported in bulk and bottled for the market in Australia. The printing of labels and the making of cases would also involve the employment of a large amount of labour. Honorable members know that many men have been thrown out of employment in the printing trade through the introduction of the linotype. We have here an opportunity of increasing employment in the printing trade, an3 so absorbing the services of many of these unemployed workmen. I see no reason why the making of oils should not become an important industry' in Australia. Some of the oils which honorable members opposite laughed at when we were dealing with, the Bounties Bill, such as peanut oil and sunflower seed oil, are of great commercial value, and might just as well be manufactured in this country. I realize that the temper of the 'Committee has led to the reduction of duties, but I trust that in this instance a truly protective duty will be imposed for the benefit of those who are manufacturing oils in Australia. </para>

                    <para>.- The argument of the honorable member who has just resumed his seat was that so many commodities are brought out in bottles that there is so much less work for those engaged- in the bottle-making industry in this country. Why, then, does not the honorable member propose that articles which are sold in bottles shall be imported only in bulk? If his concern is simply for the use of Australian-made 'bottles, I make this suggestion to- him - that if the bottle trade is beings injured, as he makes out, the wa\ to get over the difficulty is to insert in the Tariff a proviso that imported oils must come out in bulk. Why should I vote for a high duty which would not do what the honorable member wants? I think that the honorable member for North Sydney made out a good case, and I do not see any necessity for a high rate of duty on oil. We can consider what is necessary for the bottle industry when we deal with the item affecting bottles. I admit with the honorable member for Melbourne Ports that the trade is a very large one, and I also remember that there is a bottle factory in my own electorate. In fact, there is hardly, anything worth having in Australia that is not made in my electorate. Its -.representative" is, in himself, a very good sample of what can be produced there. However, the "bottle ho" argument has really nothing to do with- the case, and I must support the honorable member for North Sydney's amendment. </para>

                    <para>.- I wish to raise a protest against this new duty upon goods which we do not, and, I think, cannot, make here. There is a duty on bottles which will have to be considered hereafter, and I am prepared to protect the bottle-making industry as far as is reasonable. But we make no castor oil in Australia, nor do we make many of the other oils which are affected by this duty. I will support a duty of 2s. per gallon on olive oil. I take it that we can so devise the Tariff as to make duties apply to bottles and not to their contents. I shall not vote for a duty on goods which cannot be manufactured in Australia, unless it can be made plain to me that there is not another way of getting a duty on bottles. But I fail to see that there is no other  way.  I should think that the Trade and Customs Department ought to be able to conceive  of a means of imposing a duty on bottles without touching their contents. If the Minister will explain whether there is such a means, I should like to hear him. </para>

                        <para>- That is a reason why we should penalize those who sell other oil as olive oil. We have in Australia large areas capable of producing sufficient olive oil to meet the world's demand. In some parts of New South Wales, including my old electorate, olives are grown to perfection. The honorable member for Macquarie has, I think, overlooked the fact that if we abolish the duty on bottled olive oil it would be unfair to impose a duty on olive oil in bulk, because those who at present import oil in bulk and bottle it in Australia would thus be placed at a disadvantage. </para>

                        <para>- If we are going to protect the bottle industry, why these hysterics about the bottles used in the olive oil trade ? The imported olive oil and castor oil in general use is bottled in the Old Country by Morton and Company. A poor man wanting a penny bottle of ink has now to pay an extra penny for it, because a duty of1d. has been placed on the bottle. </para>

Like the honorable member for Macquarie,: I prefer that some of these oils should come in free, and I shall divide the Committee on the question. I fail to see how the bottle industry in the honorable member for South Sydney's electorate will be affected by this item. </para>

                    COOK (Parramatta[7.45].  - The honorable member for South Sydney made some allusion to an industry of this kind carried on in his old electorate. I presume that the honorable member was referring to the State Agricultural Farm at "Wagga Wagga. I know of no other place in the district where olives are grown. I think it may be said of that establishment, and of every place in Australia where olives are grown, that those engaged in the cultivation of the olive manufacture the oil and do their own bottling as well. These duties represent a deliberate attempt to separate the processes followed in the production of olive oil. The bottling is as much a part of the production of olive oil for commercial purposes as is the growth of the olives for the manufacture of the oil.

                        <para>- My point is that, in order to make the production of the oil as economical as possible, the processes are not separated anywhere where olive oil is produced. Here it is proposed to separate them with the object of giving a few men work. This would necessarily make the production of the oil more expensive, and raise the cost to the consumer. The Government proposal aims at something against which those who believe that we should make all these things for our selves should specially set their faces. Anything which leads to expensive production cannot ultimately benefit those engaged in an industry, whether as workers or as employers. I think we should oppose this duty if for no other reason than to try to force the producers of olive oil to undertake the whole of the processes necessary to place it on the market. If the object in imposing the duties proposed is to compel people not to import oil in bottles, we might go further, and insist that oil. imported in large bottles should be taken out of them and bottled again in smaller bottles. Let honorable members consider for a moment how that would encourage the bottling industry. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so; and one might multiply instances of the kind indefinitely. I am not quite sure that the honorable member for Balaclava did not hit the nail on the head when he suggested that the proper analogy was the sinking of holes for the purpose of filling them up again in order to create work. If we really wished to make work for the bottle-makers of Australia, perhaps the shortest way would be to smash all the bottles we have here at present. There would be just as much sense in that as the method selected by the Government for purposes of taxation in this instance. If the bottle industry is to be encouraged by Parliament, let us encourage it in a straightforward way by imposing a duty on bottles, instead of by the intricate round-about way proposed by the Government. 1 should like to know whether the Minister intends to adhere to the excessive duties he has proposed. Some of the duties submitted are absurdly "high, and apparently they have been submitted only on the plea that we should make work for Australians. In this young country, with its boundless resources, virgin soil, and productive capacity, we should be able to turn labour into more remunerative channels than the mere bottling of oil. I hope the Minister will consent to reduce these duties to a reasonable rate. I think it' would be reasonable to put the duty in paragraph a up from 6d. to od.4 instead of to is. 6d., as proposed by the Minister. </para>

                    <para>.- 1 do not think there is much in the point raised by the honorable member as applied to South Australian oils, because in that State the oil produced is bottled straight away. I have no objection to the imposition  of a duty on olive oil, because we can make enough locally to supply the whole of Australia. My trouble with the Government is that I think there should be no discrimination in the duty levied as to bottles. The duty should be levied on bottles as bottles, without respect to what they contain. I am as anxious to cultivate the industry of bottle-making as is the honorable member for South Sydney, and as anxious to impose a duty on oils that can be produced here, but I am opposed to a revenue duty on mere oils. If we were given an opportunity to deal with bulk importations first, we should know where we were. I do not object to the imposition of a substantial duty on the importation in. bulk of oils that we can make in Australia, or to a reasonable duty on bottles as bottles, which, 'of course, would affect everything imported in bottles. I ask the Government to reconsider the form in which they have submitted these duties, and give honorable members an opportunity to cast an intelligent vote. </para>

There is only a difference of 3d. between the proposal made by the honorable member for North Sydney and that which I have made.

                    <para>.- China oil is a highly refined oil. It is quite true that it is used by miners in their lamps. When the last Tariff was passed, it was admitted at a low rate of duty for that reason, but it was discovered immediately afterwards that that oil, which formerly was somewhat crude, was being highly refined and used for the same purposes as were olive oil and cotton-seed oil. It ought therefore to be in the same category. The denaturated oil is admitted free for use in lamps. </para>

The honorable member for Parramatta is quite mistaken in regard to the bounty on olive oil. The Attorney-General, who was in charge of the Bounties Bill, confirms my recollection that the item was struck out of the Bill. </para>

                    <para>.The duty proposed on lubricating mineral oil in the general Tariff is 31/4d. per gallon; and I think that the Government might very well forego the farthing. Having regard to the quantity and quality of the lubricating oil produced in Australia, 3d. per gallon represents a very substantial protection, and I ask the Minister to fix the duty at that amount. This mineral lubricating oil is quite distinct from olive oil, being extensively used wherever engines and machinery are required. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member said that he did not know of any that was produced here. However, I may inform honorable members that . a considerable quantity of lubricating mineral oil is produced in Australia. One company in my electorate is producing this oil from kerosene shale, and several other companies are likely to be soon in operation. Several large leases of shale country, comprising some 20,000 acres each, have been taken up in the Blue Mountains district, and the enterprise is likely to supply all the oil required in this country. The Commonwealth Oil Company turns out black and blue oils, which are equivalent to solar, residual, and lubricating oils, to the amount of about 3,000,000 gallons per annum, and it is hoped that that output will be increased to 5,000,000 or 6,000,000 gallons at the end of this or the beginning of next year. Such enterprise is entitled to some consideration when we are dealing with the Tariff; and the present duty. I may say, is not sufficient to deter foreign manufacturers from dumping their product here. The local manufacturers are quite satisfied with the price of from1s. 3d. to  2s.  per gallon, but there is always a danger that when they come into competition, the foreign manufacturers may cut prices. Specific  cases  have been brought under my notice, in which local companies have lost tenders by this cutting on the part of foreign producers; and this has gone on to such an extent that the position has had to be seriously considered. The Standard Oil Company, and the companies of Sumatra and other places, are able to produce so cheaply that they can afford to cut prices. I wish to emphasize the point that prices are not cut in the ordinary way of business, but only when these foreign manufacturers are called upon to tender against local people. If these oil deposits are to be developed, our own people must be protected against unfair competition ; because, if the foreign producers succeed in disabling the local industry, the people of Australia will ultimately have to pay the piper. In my opinion, nothing less than 6d. per gallon will be of any material assistance ; and such a duty would not have the effect of increasing the price to the consumer". All that the local producers desire is to be assured of the local market at present rates. I may say that the total importation into Australia is about 4,000,000 gallons of heavy oils, including lubricating, solar, and residual oils and spirit such as naphtha, benzine, and motor spirit. It will thus be seen that our output of oil is now nearly equal to Australia's requirements, and will greatly exceed that quantity a few months hence. The honorable member for Kalgoorlie seemed to think that the manufacture of lubricating mineral oils in Australia is a negligible quantity. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member referred to the industry as practically nonexistent; but I suppose he is making a special plea on behalf of the miners of Western Australia. I may say that the oil companies in my electorate employ some 1,300 men, and pay about . £13,000 in wages every month. </para>

                        <para>- Only a small number of them are employed on the building of the railway ; and a railway must be built before the shale can be got to market. This is one of the largest industries in Australia at the present time, and is well worthy of consideration; and, were it not for unfair competition, I should not be now pleading for an increase in the duty. The oil companies have undertaken additional work, with a view to protection under the. Tariff; and I hope that those interested will not be disappointed. </para>

                        <para>- I think this is a very justifiable duty, and if we strike it out we shall simply play into the hands of the great Standard Oil Trust. Much capital is already invested in Melbourne in this industry ; and I, along with other honorable members, have visited the works of the British Imperial Oil Company, and seen the whole process. Employment is given to a large number of men, and the whole of the tins and cases required are manufactured on the spot. I saw the oil tested, and since then I have used it in my own home, and found it smokeless and quite equal to an incandescent gas. The British Imperial Oil Company, to which I refer, has made as good a fight as it possibly could against the largest Trust in the world; and I point out that the duty is not really on the oil, but on the tins and cases. The oil is imported by this company in bulk from Great Britain, and not from America. </para>

                        <para>- I am supporting the white labour of Australia. This oil is imported in bulk, and pumped from the ships into tanks of about 1,000.000 gallons capacity, at the works at Williamstown. Considerable employment is given, and the oil is sold at twopence less per gallon than the oil of the Standard Oil Trust. I understand that not only <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Campbell</inline> but several others, came out from America and distributed themselves over Australia, on behalf of the Standard Oil Company. and endeavoured to ' bring about the defeat of the British Imperial Oil Company. That is their object, and if once they achieve it every settler in the back blocks will be compelled to pay considerably more for his kerosene than he has paid hitherto. </para>

                        <para>- Is not Rothschild interested in the Standard Oil Trust? Further, that Trust has instituted a system of rebates or secret commissions, against which this Parliament has legislated. They have offered a rebate to the retailers throughout the Commonwealth to induce them to dispose of no oil other than that produced by them. The British Imperial Oil Company, on the other hand, provide employment for Australian workmen. If the present duty be removed these persons will be thrown out of employment, and only the Standard Oil Trust will be benefited.' </para>

                        <para>- The duty is not upon the oil, but upon the cases, and the tins which' contain it. I sincerely trust that the Committee will show that it has the welfare of Australian industries at heart, and that it will do what it can to cripple the operations in the Commonwealth of the great Standard Oil Trust. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Riverina grew very heated over two of the most powerful trusts in existence. They are both poor devils, and I only wish that I had half of their disease. It is true that the British Imperial Oil Company brings oil to Australia in tank steamers, but what labour does it employ? For the purpose of  discharging the cargo of one of these vessels a fair-sized pump and two Malays will suffice. But it costs the Standard Oil Trust about£800 to discharge a similar quantity of oil. The latter undoubtedly provides more employment in Australia than does the former. I have : seen the British Imperial Company's tank steamers unloading in Port Jackson, and all the labour that they employed was two Malays- </para>

                        <para>- The proposed tax on kerosene, which is one of the most unpopular duties in the schedule, will bear very heavily upon the public. Kerosene is very largely used in nearly every household in the country, and oil of the best quality must be obtained. It may be very well to suggest that one oil is as good as another, but in my own household they will not use any but the best oil, because inferior oil gives off a smoke which is objectionable from a health point of view, and blackens the ceilings. In my opinion, a duty of 3d. per gallon on oil imported in tins containing less than 10 gallons would not secure the object in view. The effect of that duty will be that the Standard Oil Trust will import its oil in bulk, with the result that there will be a diminution of the labour employed here in connexion with its landing and distribution. </para>

                        <para>- Undoubtedly there is. If more oil were imported in bulk, less employment would be given locally. The importation of the oil in tins has become almost necessary, because it is so convenient, and the public are, by long usage, so accustomed to it. In the interests of the people and of the great mining community we should restore kerosene to the free list. </para>

                        <para>- Practically all the labour employed in the production of the oil is black labour. It may be all very well for places like Sydney or Melbourne to have oil brought in bulk; but in places like Fremantle and Brisbane, it is more convenient to have it brought in tins, because it enables vessels to come with a part cargo of kerosene and loaded up with other goods on which only reasonable freights are charged, because of the profit made on the carriage of the kerosene. The honorable member for Macquarie spoke about voting for the duty because oil is produced here, but his figures were somewhat confusing. He said that there are 1,300 men employed by the Commonwealth Oil Company. Assuming that they are paid 10s. a day each, the company's daily wages'-sheet shows a payment of £650, or a yearly expenditure of £195,000. ' But their output of oil, he says, is 3,000,000 gallons per annum,, so that the labour cost is about  is.  4d. per gallon. Yet, in spite of that, he says that the company would be satisfied if it were getting about1s. 4d. a  gallon for its oil. Figures like those are quite unconvincing. I shall vote to make kerosene duty free. </para>

                    <para>. - The party to which I belong has always voted against the imposition of duties on kerosene and tea, because those commodities are so largely used by the working classes. I am entirely opposed to increasing the taxation of those who can least afford to pay taxes. I feel convinced that the imposition of a duty .of 3d. per gallon on oil- imported in tins will not make that oil any dearer to the people of Australia. It will, as a matter of fact, lessen its price. Of course, some honorable members laugh at this statement, but they laugh,, too, when evidence is produced showing that the effect of duties upon goods which can be manufactured here has been, by increasing the local competition, to lower prices. We, in Australia, know of the wide ramifications of the great Standard Oil Trust, which has now such a hold upon the kerosene trade of the world that it can dictate to buyers and sellers alike the conditions under which this commodity must be traded in. Until within the last seven years the Trust had no competitor in Australia. I have little sympathy with the British Imperial Oil Trust, whether it is or is not run by the Rothschilds. But if the two trusts are sharks it is better to keep them employed in Australia fighting each other than to give the whole field to one of them. No doubt I may lose votes by supporting the duty on oil imported in tins; but that consideration weighs little with me when I know my cause to be just. We have been told that less employment will be given if oil be imported in bulk than is given now, when it is brought here in tins ; but it is not necessary to disprove a statement of that kind. My common sense tells me that twice, if not three times, as much employment will be given in Australia if .the oil comes here in bulk, to be tinned and cased locally, than is given now, when it comes in tins. The representatives of Western Australia are opposed to this duty, but apparently they are not aware that the Standard Oil Company charges 50 per cent, more for kerosene in Western Australia than in Victoria. 'But if the proposed duty is imposed, and the British-Imperial Oil Company opens works at Fremantle, the price of the Standard Oil Company's oil will be reduced to meet the competition. While the Standard oil is now being sold in Victoria at 8s. a case, it is sold in Western Australia for anything between 10s. and 12s. a case. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Fremantle on one occasion made a speech full of what he said were facts, though no one would accept them as such, and his statements, having been disproved, he wishes to disprove mine. . Honorable members are very ready to profess themselves eager to reduce the price of kerosene in the interests of the poor worker; but I ask free-traders, who say that competition is the soul of business, whether prices will not be lower with competition in the field than if, by the taking off of the duty, it is brought to an end? </para>

                    <para>.- When the last Tariff was before the House, every member of the Labour Party tried manfully to bring about what was termed a free breakfast table, and to secure the free importation of kerosene; but on this occasion none of them has raised his voice in the interests of the working .man. They appear to have lost all concern in him. The imposition of a paltry duty of 3d. per gallon has been proposed to protect a local industry, it is said. But it will have no such effect. If the local industry is to be protected, the duty must be much higher. As a matter of fact; kerosene should be admitted duty free. No class uses more kerosene than does the working class, and it will have to pay this duty, if it be imposed. </para>

                    <para>.- As I have paired on this question, I wish to explain my position in regard to the proposal of the Government. I am in favour of the duty, because I wish to keep down the price of kerosene to the consumers. I have gone carefully into the whole matter, and am convinced, from inquiries I have made, and from my visits to the Williamstown works - I shall not weary honorable  members by detailing all that I have seen and heard - that the result of doing away with the small duty proposed will be to increase the price of kerosene. The statement of the honorable member for Dalley, that less employment will be given if oil be imported in bulk, is wide of the mark. He has not taken into account all the labour employed, not only in pumping the oil from the ships to the factory, and in filling the tins, but in providing and preparing the wood for the cases, and in making the cases and tins, to say nothing of carting. If the duty be not imposed, the only real competitor which the Standard Oil Trust has in Australia will be crushed out, when an increase in the price of kerosene will follow. </para>

                    <para>.- An attempt has been made to prove that the duty is protective in its incidence, but, in my opinion, it is not. We have been piling up duties to an enormous extent. That is proved by the returns presented to-day, which show that in five months the revenue has been increased by between£800,000 and £900,000 over the normal returns. There may be some truth in the statement that the British-Imperial Oil Company has lost a lot of money here. It has been spoken of as the Rothschild Company, while the Standard Oil Trust is known as one of Rockefeller's combinations. They are two of the wealthiest companies in the world, and we may very well let them look after themselves. But I do not wish to wreck the prosperity of this country by the imposition of duties which are too heavy. If I thought that the proposed duty would really be protective, and would give a large amount of labour, I should vote for it. But I think that it. will have no protective incidence, and, in view of the state of the revenue, and the large amount of taxation which the public is now being called upon to bear, we should not continue to heap taxes upon the people. Therefore I shall vote to make kerosene free. </para>

                    <para>.- I think that before we go to a vote we should hear the views of the honorable member for Bendigo, because this duty has been recommended by the A section of the Tariff Commission, and is no doubt supported by good evidence. I feel very strongly on this item because I am quite in accord with the views of the honorable member for Laanecoorie. I challenge the honorable member for Fremantle to deny that since the British Imperial Oil Company began their operations here the price of kerosene oil has been reduced to the people of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- The company have candidly admitted that they got from Russia one shipment which was very unsatisfactory because it smoked ; but the oil which  they  are now importing and intend to import in the future is perfectly clear, and gives a light as bright as does an incandescent gas light, and, moreover, it is id. a gallon cheaper to the consumer than  is  the American oil. Why should we force the consumers to pav 2d. a gallon more for the oil which they use in the bush bv removing this duty and -so crushing out the British company? I hope that the honorable member for Bendigo will give the  Committee  the benefit of his knowledge. </para>

                        <para>- Western Australia stands first now with the right honorable member. I arn thinking not of that State alone, but of the whole continent, its people, and its industries. This is an industry which if assisted and sustained would progress and provide more and more employment for our people as time went on.  This  duty is imposed not on the kerosene,, but on the tins and cases, which are made in America. We want the oil to be imported in bulk and the tins and cases made by our own- people. I trust that the honorable member for Bendigo will tell the Committee why the A section of the Tariff Commission recommended the imposition of the duty. </para>

                    <para>.- I did not intend to speak on this matter. The honorable member for Riverina has put the case as strongly as I could do from' every stand-point. I intend to support the duty, which I hope will be carried. It was recommended on the Tariff Commission ,by two very eminent and influential Labour members - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> and ex-Senator Higgs - who were of opinion that if imposed it would tend not to increase the cost of kerosene to the -consumer, but to maintain a healthy competition between two great companies. They considered tHat it was most undesirable that the Standard Oil Company should have a monopoly of the kerosene trade pf Australia. They believed that we should if possible lend a helping  hand  to the British Imperial Oil Company, who have established vast works at Williamstown, and helped to maintain a standard price for the article. I think that on these grounds the duty ought to be supported by those who "are in favour of maintaining <inline font-style="italic">a.</inline> healthy competition, especially by a British company as against that octopus, tire world-wide Standard Oil Company. I have been given to understand that a considerable amount of British capital is invested in the British Imperial Oil Company. </para>

                        <para>- Whether their mines are on British or Asiatic soil is not the chief consideration. The ' fact that they are operated by British capital guides me in endeavoring to give them some assistance and support. I  may  mention that already this proposition has had  a  very healthy effect on the Standard Oil Company. So far as I can gather from their correspondence they indicate an intention to tin and case their oil here. Their . only complaint is that they have not  had  time in which to dispose of the tinned kerosene, but if that concession is made they will be able to come here,, and lay down an installation for the purpose of doing their tinning and packing here- I" have gathered that information from- a letter which I have just read. I believe that the imposition of the duty will not result in an increased price, but will assist' in maintaining healthy competition between the two companies, and causing more labour \ to be employed in the handling .of  the  oil. </para>

Those two honorable members said that they want this duty to be imposed in order to save  the  British Imperial Oil Company from the clutches of an octopus, the Standard OiCompany. The honorable member for Bendigo, however, says that the latter company are willing to come here, so that by the  Imposition  of the duty my honorable friends will not save the British Imperial Oil Company from their  clutches. </para>

                        <para>- No, that will simply bring the two companies to closer' grips, and put them on even terms. If this tremendous octopus company can beat the British-Imperial Oil Company they. will maintain their supremacy when they establish works here. The evidence, however, shows that the British-Imperial Oil Company have, so far, competed satisfactorily with the Standard Oil Company. </para>

                        <para>- I am told that all the work is done in the Straits Settlements and by black labour, too. Honorable members who have been declaiming against the Standard Oil Company to-night went beside themselves the other night in declaiming against the importation of Rangoon candles. "These candles," they said, "are made in India, and therefore we must impose prohibitive duties." Now it seems that they are quite in favour of admitting free kerosene oil produced by black labour in the Straits Settlements. Their conduct does not seem to be quite consistent. Black, labour in the Straits Settlements is surely just as bad as black labour in Rangoon. </para>

I know nothing about the company, and in view of the Minister's statement to-night, although it was formally withdrawn at the direction of the  Chairman,  I think it is necessary to say that I have never met one of their representatives. I have no sympathy with this huge trust in any shape or form. But I have a genuine sympathy with those persons in Australia who have been paying more for their kerosene since this duty was imposed. </para>

                    <para>.- Unlike the honorable member for Parramatta, I know the representatives of the British Imperial Oil Company, and have met the representative of the Standard Oil Trust. -My desire has been to ascertain the exact truth in connexion with both companies. It is needless for me to assure honorable members that I have no interest in them, either directly or indirectly. I am quite satisfied that they are well able to look after their own interests. I think that the Committee should not vote on this question without definite knowledge. This morning I ascertained that the British Imperial Oil Company Limited consist of 2,000 shares, of which the Asiatic Petroleum Company Limited hold 1,993 shares. </para>

Several honorable members have broadly stated that the British Imperial Oil Company are not a British company, but are owned and controlled by the Rothschilds and others. I submit that the honorable member for Kooyong is entitled to show that their statements are not correct. </para>

                        <para>- Several honorable members have mentioned the names of different companies, and said that they were not this, that, or the other, but the honorable member for Kooyong was going into the details of a company when he began to refer to their share list, and if he is allowed to make that reference the discussion may embrace a great deal more than the share list. If I allowed a discussion to follow on that, it would eventually drift into a debate on the status of the two companies. </para>

                        <para>- I have no other object than to assure honorable members as to the exact position. It ought to be made clear that the company is, essentially, just like any other foreign company. The statement that it is an entirely British company is not correct. I will not go into details, but may state that the matter has been dealt with by a Committee of the Chamber of Commerce, who considered that under the circumstances there is no justification or need for this duty. It is my intention to vote for free kerosene. </para>

                        <para>- I endeavour to inform myself by reading up about other items with which we have to deal, and with which I have no personal acquaintance. But this is a matter about which I did not need to read up. This duty is simply a tax on the raw materials of a great many trades. If is true that a description of white lead has been manufactured in Australia, but it was of poor quality and not anything like up to the accepted commercial standard. There is a quantity of sulphate of lead which is simply a cheap by-product, and has been manufactured in Australia. I have here a letter from a firm, who tell me that they themselves in years gone by, made about  300  tons of it; but they admit that it was an article that was altogether inferior to genuine white lead, and that, if supplied to. the public of Great Britain as such a breach of the law would be committed. </para>

                        <para>- I am not speaking now of colours prepared for use. They are different altogether. They are colours mixed up with oil and turpentine, and ready for use with a brush. What I am referring to are colours ground in liquid, which have to be thinned out with turpentine or with water and size according to whether they are to be used with oil or in distemper. No attempt has been made in Australia to manufacture them. The duty is one which will fall heavily upon the users of these paints, and particularly heavily upon those small contractors who are in the habit of undertaking contracts for painting weatherboard houses and other small works. To obtain a cheap material is a matter of great concern to them. Apart from that, the duty would not help any local industry that has been established, nor would it encourage any industry that is likely to be established. </para>

                        <para>- Only two or three standard makers are recognised in the whole world. Indeed, practically there is only one maker, whose white lead is specified for good work. This is well known to every one in the trade - to every architect, to every painter, and to every artist. This tax applies not only to white lead, but equally to other colours ground in water, which are largely used for scenic purposes in Australia. They are scarcely used in any other way, except perhaps for very fine decorative purposes. If my amendment be carried, the item will be brought more into line with the Old Tariff, under which a duty of 2s. per cwt. was imposed. </para>

                        <para>- We cannot interfere with paragraph  a  without prejudicing the raw materials of the paints dealt with in the item. I am sure that every protectionist desires the production of linseed in Australia to be promoted, and the white lead industry to be developed. It is well said that those are the basic elements of paint, and very heavy duties have been imposed upon them. Consequently we must have a heavier duty on the prepared article. </para>

                        <para>- I am referring to the duties on oil and white lead. Paint cannot be built up without those elements. The paint manufacturers who came before the Tariff Commission in the various States said in effect, " If you give us our raw materials free, we shall not ask for a duty ; but since there are very heavy duties on our raw materials " - and it is most desirable that there should be duties on them in order that their production may be encouraged - " we must have a heavier duty on the finished article, and more particularly upon the superior paints." Some of them said that they did not desire as heavy a duty on the common grades as they sought on the superior grades, having zinc as a base. This Tariff does not discriminate between the two classes ; it merely imposes duties upon paints ground in oil, and paints completely prepared. If we wish to promote the production of linseed oil and to develop the white lead industry, as well as the production of various colours, we must have these duties. If we break down the first paragraph, the whole scheme will collapse. It is most desirable that linseed oil - and the beginning of its production in </para>

                <para class="block">Australia is not far distant - should not be free; if it is we shall not be able to enter upon its production, in commercial quantities. I recognise that a duty on it imposes a burden on the painting trade ; but it may be only a temporary one; and when we have-established the industry of producing linseed oil in Australia we shall be able to make a <inline font-style="italic">pro rata</inline> reduction in the duty on the complete article. The production of white lead in Australia is progressing, but local prejudice has to be combated. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member has a ready excuse. Victoria did not awaken to the importance of the paint manufacturing industry when it was at the height of its protectionist boom. Prior to Federation, New South Wales was accustomed to have these, and cognate items, on the free list; whilst Queensland had a duty of 3s. per cwt. ; South Australia a duty of 2s. per cwt., and of 4s. per cwt. in the case of the made-up articles ; Tasmania, a duty of Jd. per lb. ; and Western Australia a duty of .10 per cent. Under the first Federal Tariff, the duty under this item was 2s. per cwt., and the Government now propose to raise it to 4s. 6d. on foreign imports, and to 4s. per cwt. on. imports from Great Britain. Having enjoyed for five years an increase of 200 per cent, on the old Victorian Tariff, paint manufacturers here, instead, of being able to show that their industry is a flourishing one, are asking for more protection, and the Treasurer offers them a still further increase of 250 per cent The honorable member for Bendigo says that these proposals have been very carefully considered, and I must certainly admit that the paint manufacturers have been . most carefully considered. But what about those who use paint? To my mind, the honorable member for Bendigo gave away his case when he said that the excessive duties upon the raw materials of the paint-making industry, made it necessary to impose a high duty on the finished article. That being so, this cannot be called a scientific Tariff. </para>

                    <para> The manager of a paint and oil company in Sydney bad seen samples of white lead that were said to have been manufactured in Sydney. They could not compare with the imported article so far as colour was concerned. Locally produced white lead turned yellow after standing a given time, while the imported article keeps its colour much longer. The defect did not lie in the local lead or zinc, but in manufacture, which, in his opinion, experience would tend to remedy. </para>

                <para class="block">The Committee are asked to place a heavy duty on prepared paints, so that in the days to come, an improved white lead may be produced in Australia. I believe that the proper way to encourage the manufacture of paint would be to place linseed oil, white lead, and the other raw materials of the industry,, either on the free list or under as low a duty as possible. I have many sides to my character as a politician, and I happen to have in my electorate the largest paint manufactory in the Commonwealth. Nevertheless, I do not ask for a duty upon prepared paint, but I would assist the industry in the way I have indicated. The honorable member for Lang very reasonably asks the Treasurer t'o' revert to the duty imposed under the j 902 Tariff. Surely the Prime Minister «Ould not have agreed to an increase of 250 per cent, on that duty, when he knows that in protectionist Victoria, in the palmiest days of protection, no more than 2s. was asked. The honorable member for Lang proposes a duty of 25 per cent, in excess of that dutv, and I must say that it is rather rash of the honorable member as a freetrader to make such a proposal </para>

                        <para>-That is so. It is further said that one reason why they have failed to produce this to any extent in Australia is, that the plant to treat it properly is too expensive, in view of the limited local demand. A <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Borthwick,</inline> another manufacturer, contradicts the statement made' by the honorable member for Bendigo concerning siennas and umbers, at page 78 of the evidence. He says that siennas and umbers, as well as other colours, have not yet been found in Australia. In addition to the high duty, the Victorian Government gave a subsidy to Messrs. Patterson Brothers, I think of this city, who claimed to have discovered suitable pigments for making colours on their property. This attempt to foster the industry collapsed, and the Government foreclosed on the machinery mortgaged to it to cover the subsidy. The honorable member for Bendigo referred chiefly to colours ground in oil. I do not think the honorable member made any reference to the numerous colours ground in water. As water is free, the honorable member could not claim that those colours, in a manufactured condition, should be subject to a duty because the ingredients used in mixing them are subject to duty. Here are a few of these colours which occur to my mind at the present time : . ultramarine, cobalt, Prussian blue, carnation paste, emerald green, Brunswick green, brown lake, carmine, chrome yellows, chrome green, Dutch pink, celestial blue, azure blue, flake white, sienna umber, Vandyke brown, and vermilion. I think with a little consideration, I could name half a hundred different colours, none of which are manufactured,- or likely to be manufactured, in Australia, because the pigments from which they are manufactured are not obtained here. </para>

                    <para>.- I wish to correct a misquotation by  the honorable member for Lang. Of course, the honorable member was not aware that he was misquoting <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Clarkson's</inline> evidence; but if he will look at the evidence again, he will find that he represented that gentleman as saying precisely the opposite of what- he did say. The honorable member attributed to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Clarkson</inline> the statement that the demand for white lead in Australia is insufficient to make it worth while to manufacture the article here. Mi". Clarkson did not say anything of the. kind. What he said was that the only pigments being produced in South Australia were iron oxides. </para>

                <para class="block">We put a duty on linseed oil, one of the raw materials of this industry, and we should now complete the scheme proposed by the TarifF Commission, and enable white lead to be successfully manufactured in the Commonwealth. As to other colours, a variety is produced at the Blumberg mine, South Australia, and in various parts of the Commonwealth. The secretary to the Blumberg mine, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O'Connell,</inline> gave pretty lengthy evidence before the Commission as to the necessity for a duty to enable the company to compete against wealthy British companies. The industry is well worth establishing, and will undoubtedly be established in every State in the Commonwealth. There is therefore no likelihood of a monopoly in the manufacture of paints. There will be pretty fierce local competition, and instead of prices being increased for more than a very temporary period, it is almost certain that as the result of the building up of the industry here, prices will be kept very much lower than they would be &gt; likely to be should the industry be crushed out, as it would be if these duties are not imposed. </para>

A quantity of sulphate of lead, which is a cheap by-product, has been manufactured here - we ourselves in years gone by have utilized about 300 tons of the same. It is an article altogether inferior in covering power to genuine white lead, and, if offered to the public in Great Britain as such, would be a breach of the law. </para>

            <para>I have now to report that .the sample of lead for a white -paint, left after an interview, on your instructions, by the Australian White Lead Company, was analyzed and proved to contain within 0.3 of being pure. The sulphate of lead, that is the result of their process, is a very suitable substance for a paint, and. is produced under conditions favouring a fine state of division, and that quite forbid the presence of free sulphuric acid. Tests were made to discover its covering power, as compared with that of the best white lead obtainable in Melbourne ; it was tested for any foreign material, such as baryta, and was found to be pure. Two " sets of comparative tests were made, and measured quantities of the oils, &amp;c, employed in the paints, were taken in each test. The paint was employed upon wooden' surfaces and upon glass, in order to see the actual body of the coating when dry. One set was with boiled linseed oil, and the other with raw linseed oil, all other things being equal, and that the covering power of the resulting paint was nearly equal in the two cases for whiteness and body, the balance being still rather in favour of the sulphate of lead, as against the white lead of commerce, which is, as is well known, a basic carbonate. </para>

                    <para>. - All the manufacturers like to get their raw material free, but unfortunately in practically every instance the raw material of one industry is the finished article of another. The question of paints and their constituent parts is so complicated that it is hard to discover what is really the basic raw material. The worst of it is that each manufacturer concerned wants his raw material free, and each condemns the Australian-made raw material, saying, " I have to compete with the rest of the world in the Australian market, and must get the best material to use. in producing my manufactured article. Therefore, I must import it." The manufacturer of white lead in Australia assures us, and backs up his assurance with a certificate, quoted by the honorable member for Bendigo, from a gentleman duly qualified to express an opinion, that the article which he is producing is as good as, if not superior to, the imported -white lead. Unfortunately, the man who uses white lead in making paint, being interested, condemns the Australian white lead. He says, " I want imported colouring material if I. am to give my customers the paints which they demand. I must also have imported white lead." The manufacturer of colours in Australia shows us that he* is quite competent to produce the best' colours, having men here who are qualified through experience in other parts of the world. The honorable member for Lang stated that it was impossible to make these colours in Australia. He enumerated all the colours of the rainbow, from elephant's breath to boiled mutton, and told us that they could not be made here. But first-class pigments are produced in South Australia. I am not surprised1 at the honorable- member" for Lang making that statement, because he is a free-trader - a foreign representative. </para>

                        <para>- If the remark is offensive to the honorable member for Lang,. I withdraw it without qualification. I was not speaking. in a personal but merely in a political sense. In spite of what the honorable member for Lang says, there is arn establishment in my electorate which is producing first-class colours. I am sure to be asked whether there are any of these' works* in mv electorate. That is getting rather a. by-word now, but I have voted for the protection of industries. that are not in my electorate, and I shall certainly .support those that are. That .firm have imported: a man who has had twenty-five years' experience in England. They can produce any of the colours which the honorable member for Lang says are not made here. They turn out good commercial commodities, which are on the market at the present day. But it is essential, in order that they may keen them upon the. market, that they should have some protection. There are certain portions of their ra w material which they have to import, and., seeing that there is a duty on that, it is necessary that they should get a duty on their manufactured article, which, <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> its turn, is the raw material of another, industry, <inline font-style="italic">so</inline> that they may compete with imported articles. Then the house or coach painter,, who uses paints, wants his;'raw material as cheaply as possible. The coachbuilder is strongly protected - I have many in my electorate-  7-and  yet he will send us documents to show' that we must npt ask him to use the Australian article. But the very argument that we have to .adduce to get "him to use it, is the one which we have to urge, in order to get the Australian public to use the finished article which he produces. So that we find the same difficulty all along the line. It matters little to me what the commodity is so long as we can -bring the' industry in Australia up to a proper standard. There is no process in the manufacture of white lead, or the making of pigments, or the mixing of paints, that cannot be undertaken here. In the newspapers honorable members will see an advertisement to the' following effect: - " Mixed .paint. 3d. per tin. Don't be prejudiced,- ' 'Buy it and give it a trial."' </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member may know how to use paints when they are mixed, but is he scientist enough to know that lead can be treated in such a way as not to be poisonous ? I am assured by those who run this business in Footscray that their treatment of the lead makes it non-poisonous, and that it has no bad effect upon those who handle it. But the individual who uses the paint says, " That is the very reason why the Australian article is of no use to us." They practically say that it is no good because it does not kill those who produce it. On the one hand, we are asked, " What is the condition of those who manufacture the white lead in England?" and we answer, "It is lamentable ; they die at ages when they have no right to die." Then when we say, " Here is a commodity that will not poison the workers," we are told, "It is useless for our purposes." We do not expect any assistance from free-traders in this instance, but we desire, and should be able to demand, the votes of all those who came into this House as protectionists. </para>

                        <para>- The circular said just what the honorable member for Bendigo himself said. Something beyond what the circular said might be inferred, but the fact stated was that the white lead produced here is made from sulphate of lead, and that it cannot be of as good quality as white lead made from carbonate of lead. In that there is no. comparison between Australian and British white lead, because the same statement would apply to the two processes in Great Britain. White lead produced from sulphate of lead is, in the opinion of scientific men, and of users, inferior to white lead produced from carbonate of lead, wherever it may be produced. That was all that was stated in the circular, and it was the statement repeated by the honorable member for Bendigo later. Every statement of the kind made from this side seems to be twisted into a reflection on Australian production. There is much tenderness shown in this relation, although, as I have pointed out, the same comparison could be shown  between the two products in Great Britain.. I do not think that there ought to be such sensitiveness, or such a disposition to turn all criticism into an attack upon Australian productions. The question whether sulphate of lead or carbonate of lead makes the best white lead is not one involving any. reflection on the Australian product. </para>

                        <para>- I do not regard those individual statements as conclusive. First of all, I decline to believe that a metallurgist has necessarily an expert knowledge of the covering qualities of white lead; when he begins to talk about the covering qualities of lead he steps outside his function altogether. The question is one for a practical painter; and experience must be the great teacher.  I fancy that covering qualities ultimately depend on the wearing qualities of the lead ; that must be the test. So far from the honorable member for Echuca being singular in the quotation he made to-night, and in the views to which he gave utterance, I have to say that a practical ironmonger, a friend of mine in Sydney - a man of the highest integrity, who has been selling white lead all his life - expressed the same opinion. </para>

Is it suggested that these statements are made out of sheer wantonness? Honorable members ought not to attack people for making statements in all good faith. We are 'here to discuss these matters, and not to abuse one another. I  have never witnessed a more savage attack than that made on the honorable member for Echuca; but I fancy he will be able to live through it all, and, perhaps, ultimately benefit. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for North Sydney has stated that he does not know that Australian white lead is used for painting purposes.

At that time metallic lead was£131s. 3d. per ton, and instead of a percentage rise in the price of white lead, owing to the increased! cost of the. raw material there was a reduction of over <inline font-style="italic">£3</inline> per ton. </para>

He seems to think that nothing made in Australia can possibly be equal in quality to what is made elsewhere. </para>

                    <para>.- The proposed rates of 6s.9d. and 6s., or 25 and 20 per cent, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem,</inline> whichever returns the higher duty, on paints and colours prepared for use, will be a very severe impost upon an anti-corrosive paint which is used for ships! bottoms. It is a patented article, prepared by a secret process, and has to be imported, its value being about £150 a ton, whereas ordinary paint costs from £20 to £30 per ton. When the last Tariff was under discussion, on my motion the Government agreed to substitute for an alternative rate the fixed rate of 4s. per cwt. The Government has, by departmental regulation, exempted deep-sea ships on which this paint is used from the payment of duty, and I wish to secure the same exemption for Inter-State vessels. </para>

                    <para>.- No doubt other honorable members have, like myself, received statements from the master coachbuilders and wheelwrights of New South Wales and Victoria, in which they say that last year the imports of foreign-made vehicles were valued at only £9,500, and that the estimated value of vehicles of all classes made in Australia is £2,000,000 per ' annum. They are satisfied with the present rates of duty, under which they have, as a matter of fact, been able to establish an export trade, but they object to the increasing of duties on their raw materials. </para>

                        <para>- They use a great deal of Queensland and other Australian woods, the only timber imported by them being hickory for shafts and spokes. I have seen dozens of vehicles made in Ballarat and Melbourne very largely from Australian timbers. There is practically no paint ground in liquid, or paint prepared for use, made in this country, although the honorable member for Bendigo says that in time it will be manufactured here. I was concerned in a white lead making company which was started at Footscray, but, although it spent a great deal of money, it could not get on, not for want of a duty, because the price was good enough, but because it could not make a proper article.

                        <para>- I know as much about the matter as did the witnesses who came before the Tariff Commission. Years ago the Americans used to send vehicles here, but within the last decade, hardly one has been imported, and I do not think that there are ten imported buggies in Victoria at the present day. Furthermore, the Railway Workshops make the carriages and waggons required for the railways, the wood used in each case being nearly all Australian. </para>

                <para>The duty on a certain high-class and high-priced paint imported from England, has been increased, with the result that, instead of having to pay 4s. per cwt., which equals 8d. per gallon, it has to pay 20 per cent., plus 3 0 per cent., which. equals 4s. id. per gallon. Under the old Tariff, this paint was so expensive that it could be used only in good work, such as railway cars, hospitals, ships, &amp;c, and the new dutypracticallly prohibits its use. I hope that . the Minister will consent to a large reduction. I shall support the proposed amendment of the honorable member for Dalley. </para>

It was distinctly stated by the speakers that they did not want an increased duty on the finished article, and were quite satisfied with the protection they had against outside competition. They asked the Minister that the duties in the old Tariff should be allowed to stand.

                        <para>- Yes ; but the percentage on the cheaper paints is very much higher than the percentage on the dearer paints. I do not like these alternative duties, because attempts will be made to evade them. In the case of paints it will be quite impossible in many cases to distinguish them. Where there are great variations in value, as there are in many cases, the 'Customs officers will have great difficulty in distinguishing them. I would far rather see a fixed duty, even at the higher amount proposed by the honorable member for Bendigo, than the duty previously proposed. I shall not raise any objection to the amendment of the honorable member for Bendigo, but I propose to move the omission of the duties of 25 and 20 per cent. </para>

                    (Balaclava) fn.6].- As the old duty of 4s. has been increased to 6s., it means a duty of
                    <inline font-style="italic">£fi</inline>
                    a ton. That, I think, ought to be sufficient protection on any class of paint. To my mind, it is a very big charge. I do not know what paint is worth, but I should think that
                    <inline font-style="italic">£20</inline>
                    would be a very good price. On that value a duty of
                    <inline font-style="italic">£6</inline>
                    a ton would be equal to 20 per cent. It is a most difficult thing for any person to assess the value of these articles. Preferably I would support a fixed duty on ' all things, because it does away with any inducement to commit a fraud. If we impose an
                    <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline>
                    duty and a fixed duty, it will only encourage persons to undervalue their goods, whereas if we impose a fixed duty only they will know exactly what they have to pay, and there will be no inducement to commit a fraud.

                        <para>- The reductions proposed by the honorable member for Gwydir is a paltry, contemptible one, and I would sooner vote for the original duty. It is an abuse of terms to speak of these duties as reasonable. So far as I can learn, there is very little of this material imported. The Treasurer will agree to nothing, but now and again he puts up an honorable member on his own side to make a slight reduction. </para>

                    <para>. - I think the Treasurer should be more reasonable. Items have been passed to-day with a rapidity I did not expect. We might reasonably have expected that the discussion of the kerosene duty would have occupied a whole day. There is one item in this division on which it is necessary that something should be said, because the increase proposed in the duty is enormous. I refer to item  237 -  varnishes. I suggest that the Minister should postpone the consideration of that item. </para>

                        <para>-There is the answer to the suggestion that the Treasurer should agree to the postponement of the one item of. varnishes. This is what we get in return for checking debate on the kerosene duty. It should not be forgotten that even if the Minister applied the closure to the debate, and merely took a division on each item, it would be impossible for him to get the Tariff through before Christmas without the co-operation of the Opposition. </para>

Still, I suggest that this division might be put through to-night. I must say that the Opposition have treated honorable members on this side fairly to-night. I point out with regard to varnishes that the proposed increase is not such an enormous one as has been suggested, and I think it will be found when we reach the item that there is a fair prospect of an agreement upon it. </para>

                    <para>. - I should like to know whether the Minister can give any information on the item of white lead. I admit that it is very rare for him to give information. Will he tell us. where white lead is produced in Australia, under what conditions, what wages are paid in the industry, if it is an industry worth cultivating in Australia, and what justification he has for this huge increase in the duty ? White lead is one of the raw materials for the manufacture of paint. The number of men interested in getting it in at a moderate rate of duty far outweighs the number of men who will be employed in any industry of the kind which is likely to be developed in Australia for some time to come. Why we should be constantly taxing the raw materials of certain industries, I am at a loss to understand. But apparently the Treasurer has only to sit tight and he gets everything through without a word of explanation. Scarcely one honorable member knows where, in Australia, this white lead is produced. </para>

                        <para>- As the Committee is determined not to reduce the duty, the next best thing is to justify it. Will any more labour be employed if the duties are increased? Is the new protection to apply to the industry if established under these inordinate rates ? I will not vote a 100 per cent, increase in any duty unless I know that the workman is to benefit, and that the best labour conditions are to apply. Why tax the raw material of the painters of the Commonwealth, who are making a bare living as it is? I like a fair thing, but I do not think this is a fair thing. We are told that this white lead - I hope that I shall not be accused of slandering Australian industries- </para>

I wished to find out how much of this article was imported, but the figures are not at all clear. I am referred "over the leaf," but that tells us nothing, because there I find "colours, dry, n.e.i." I should like to know where white lead is produced in Australia, how many men are employed, what wages are paid, and the area of the works? I should like to know, further, from the Minister of Trade and Customs, in the absence of the Treasurer, whether he feels justified in agreeing to the reasonable proposition that the duties should be 2s. and 1s. 6d. ? </para>

                    <para>. - This is a debatable item which might well occupy the Committee profitably for at least half a sitting; and yet we are asked to deal with it at midnight. I decidedly object to any " double banking." Let people know what they have to pay one way or the other. If the Minister of Trade and Customs will agree to leave out the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty I shall have no more to say. </para>

                    <para>. -In the first place, it is undeniable that a difficulty is experienced in checking the values of varnishes. That fact would enable dishonest firms to obtain a trade advantage. In the second place, a good deal of this work has to be done in competition with other places. A considerable portion of it has to be done upon vessels, and upon articles which go out of Australia. Seeing that New Zealand levies a duty of only  2s.  per gallon upon varnishes, the imposition of the rate proposed would offer a premium to all vessels which touch at the Dominion and Australia to get their work done there. For these reasons the Treasurer might well agree to the suggestion which has been made. </para>

                    <para>. - Several persons have contended that under the operation of the duty proposed, ships would visit New Zealand in order to get their varnishing work done there. I do not believe that many vessels would go there specially for that purpose. But I confess that I do not like a double duty. At the same time, I do not wish to allow the higher class importations to escape taxation. I move - </para>

                        <para>- Under the existing system the higher grades of varnish will be admitted at a cheap rate. Unfortunately, while the Treasurer is frequently derided by the Opposition for refusing to give way upon Tariff matters, he yields more to the members of that body than he does to his own supporters. The varnish made here is good enough for the varnishing of the railway carriages of Victoria, and therefore I think that the least the Minister could have done was to insist upon his original proposal. Now that he has agreed to a reduction, it is hopeless for me to try to move him. </para>

                    <para>. - I am informed that liquid removers of paints and varnish generally consist of mixtures of turpentine and spirits, or similar substances, their manufacture being a very simple process. Under the old Tariff they were free as unspecified article's, there being no dutiable heading under which they could be placed. This was considered anomalous, and therefore the previous proposal was made. </para>

                        <para>- I suppose the Treasurer is never insulting. I object to Tariffs being made by officials who should be tax-gatherers and not tax-framers. It is their duty to protect the revenue, and to make suggestions to that end ; but they step beyond their functions when they make proposals for the protection of Australian industries. That is the business of this Parliament. The officials have no right to interfere in it. </para>

                <para class="block">This is a matter I know something about, and, in my opinion, the departmental officers did quite right in suggesting the insertion of the item. They were actuated by the desire to protect the revenue of the Commonwealth, and it is a pity that reflections have been cast on men who know more about the working of the Department than we do. It is their duty to point out anything that they think to be wrong, while it is. our duty to judge the wisdom of their suggestions. I think that in this case they have done quite right. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. When they put. spirits of turpentine and something else together they have a liquid remover. From what I can hear, it is an extremely simple thing to make. The Tariff Commission made no recommendation on this head. No one has asked for a duty to be imposed, and at the most the Minister has said that it is a Ministerial recommendation. In those circumstances I do not think that we need worry very much about the matter, but. I  suggest to the honorable member for Parramatta that he might accept the Minister's proposal to make the duty 5percent. in the general Tariff, and to admit British imports free, as it approximates to his own idea. </para>

If has been stated that the officers are Victorians. The Comptroller-General does happen to be a Victorian. No one can question his ability, capacity and integrity. He is second to no officer in the Public Service. The next officer who administers the Department happens to come from New South Wales, and he also isa very competent officer. </para>

Their function is to protect the revenue, and not to suggest or to control' our fiscal policy. The latter function appertains to the Minister and to this 'Parliament. </para>

                        <para>-Then the honorable member can go outside. I subscribe to all that has been said as to the ability and integrity of the officers of the Department. I have never doubted them. I do not believe that we could have more capable men at the head of the Department of Trade and Customs than are there to-day. My point is clear - that they are there to assist the Minister m administering the Tariff, hot to make suggestions for new and high duties. </para>
