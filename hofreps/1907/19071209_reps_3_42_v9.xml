It appears that the' officers can get no clear information - the matter is clouded in mystery - and to them the rulings of the Minister are as clear as mud. I desire to know to what holidays temporary employes are entitled, and whether they are paid for them; and if they are not paid for. holidays, will the' Minister see that they are allowed to work on all holidays except Christmas Day and Good Friday ? </para>

                            <para>- With- all submission, I think not. I am well aware, generally, of the objections that may be taken to the Bill; but when those objections have been recorded here, we might well come to a decision. After all, the final  word does not rest with us. We -are acting under the advice of our law officers ; and, under the circumstances, there would seem to be no other course than to pass the Bill. Those who object to it, or fake a different view of the legal questions involved, may protect themselves by taking their objections ; and it is not unreasonable to- say that this ought to suffice-. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Coolgardie asked a question in reference 'to this matter some four or  five  days ago. and this morning I forwarded him a reply to the effect that a mistake had been made - as stated by the  Acting Comptroller-General of Customs - in that only an estimate had been given of the number of pianos imported into New South Wales, instead of the actual number. I have requested the officials in Sydney to furnish  me  with the most definite particulars that it is possible to obtain, and immediately I receive these, I will supply the information to honorable members. But, undoubtedly a mistake has been made, so that honorable members need not base their remarks in reference to the duty upon pianos upon the figures which have been supplied. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. It seems very extraordinary to charge such a high duty as 6d. per lb. .upon the frames. In another portion of the Tariff, frames are dutiable at a different rate - I think, at  30  per cent., under the general Tariff, and at  25  per cent, under the Tariff for the United Kingdom. Yet here it is proposed to charge 6d. per lb. upon them. </para>

But now it is proposed to withhold from persons in other countries the privilege of sending through the post a circular or catalogue to persons within Australia. Is it intended to stop the circulars and catalogues as they arrive in the mails and impose a duty or to communicate with the senders ? </para>

                        <para>- I am against the proposal, but now I am trying to elicit what the Ministry desire. We are not treated in that way by European countries. Australian catalogues are allowed to go through the post, and to be delivered. Is it intended here to stop the 'delivery of catalogues or trade price lists when posted from other countries to persons in Australia? I hope that the Treasurer does not intend to do that. It would be very unfair in view of the fact that Che catalogues and price lists of our business men receive such different treatment from other countries. </para>

It ought not to apply to price lists and trade catalogues sent here by outside persons who, of course, could not get their printing done here. Such persons should not be treated, even from the Minister's stand-point in the same way as persons who are carrying on business within our territory. </para>

                        <para>- It is intended that they shall be free. It has been represented to the Comptroller-General that the catalogues which are posted from other countries give a great deal of information to our business men, and it is not intended that they shall be dutiable. It is intended, however, that every person who does business in Australia shall get his printing done here. Complaints have also been made regarding the printing .of supplements to Australian newspapers in other countries. Suppose that the proprietors of a newspaper get their supplements printed in England or elsewhere, it is not fair that they should be admitted free. The object of this item is to prevent firms which are doing business in Australia from getting their printing done in other parts of the world, and securing free admission of the printed matter. </para>

                <para>Most of the Master Printers' Associations of Australia had no objection to British and foreign manufacturers' price lists and catalogues being admitted free of duty so long as the same privilege was not accorded to Australian manufacturers attempting to get their work done abroad. </para>
                <para>That is the evil j printing done abroad for Australian houses is brought here to compete with local printers, but the local printers do not object to British and foreign merchants being allowed to print their own price lists and catalogues, and bring them in for commercial purposes. Consequently, I suggest to the Treasurer that he should add after the word "Catalogues" the words "printed for Australian houses to advertise goods sold in Australia." </para>

                    <para>- - I do not think that the Treasurer's amendment would meet the cas.e. I can quite see a very -wide distinction between an Australian firm sending its printing out-  side Australia, and an English firm having branches in Australia, and desiring to import its own printing. Take the case of Sutton's, the well-known seed merchants. They have an establishment in practically every town in the Commonwealth.' According to the Treasurer's amendment, Sutton's seed catalogue would be taxed on coming into Australia. I do not think that that is the intention of the Minister, and I am sure that it is not the intention pf the Committee. The Master Printers had no intention that' the catalogues of large English firms, having branch houses all over Australia, and sending their catalogues out to advertise their business, should be taxed, and I think that that should be made perfectly clear. The Treasurer's amendment would mean that any English firm having an establishment in Melbourne or Sydney would not be able to bring in its catalogues for distribution without paying duty. Personally, I do not desire to impose any taxation at all on catalogues advertising such goods as machinery, books, and seeds, I do not think that this is a source .from which we really want to draw revenue. The duty can give no employment to our own people, and if is good policy to admit catalogues and price lists free. </para>

                    <para>.- I have received a letter from an advertising firm in Adelaide who point out that these duties work out at 100 per cent. The letter is from Fred C. Powell, street car advertising agent, and agent for calendars, novelties, show-cards, and signs. The writer says - </para>

                    <para>There is no discrimination between the fully finished goods intended to advertise the foreign made article, and the partially finished material intended to be finished here and to be used in advertising Australian made goods. </para>

                <para>He goes on to say - </para>

                    <para>I have employed considerable labour in the finishing of these goods, desiring to have as much work as possible done locally. Therefore, if the Tariff is not made to discriminate as I have suggested between matter with advertisements and matter without advertisements, it will pay better to import them wholly finished. </para>

                <para class="block">I have also been requested by the Public Libraries Board in South Australia to say that whatever duty may be fixed on these lines, there should be a proviso to the following effect - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>Except when imported for use in Public Libraries, Museums, or Art Galleries ; in which case they should be free of duty. I think that suggestion is worthy of the attention of the Treasurer. I have received a second letter from the firm to which I have previously referred, in which the writer points out that - the duty under the old Tariff, 3d. per lb., or 25 per cent., whichever was the higher, was often, at the former collection, as high a rate as 50 per cent, on the value, and 6d.. per lb. is 100 per cent. - too heavy a tax on the Australian "manufacturer who uses advertising matter. Nowadays it is imperative that advertisements be of a very attractive character, and whilst it is possible that a few of the larger firms can have matter of their own special design, this is not possible for those in a smaller way. </para>

                <para class="block">The writer also points out that the Dunlop Company can have their own designs, whereas smaller companies like the Phoenix or Atlas Tyre Companies have to use matter procured outside Australia, but finished here. I think that the old duty was quite sufficient. It amounted to 50 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- I presume that the object of these excessive duties, amounting, as the honorable member for Grey has said, to too per cent., is to exclude newspaper supplements and such like material, as well as to compel our business people to have their printing done locally. I do not know why we should be at such pains to make people do so, and I say this with no desire to belittle our own printeries. On the contrary, I hold that we ought to support them : but I do not think that we should eventually help them by completely shutting out this material, representing, as it does the skill, enterprise and up-to-dateness of the world. </para>

                        <para>-The Treasurer may propose to cover magazines by this paragraph and to exclude them from later ones. Magazines and periodicals would certainly be covered by the words "unframed, having advertisements thereon," unless we took steps to exclude them. If our people insist upon going to the other end of the world for some particular article or paper, we should not prevent their doing so, provided that they are prepared to pay a reasonably heavy penalty. But is not a duty of  100  per cent. altogether too high? I have no sympathy with those who seek abroad what can be reasonably done for them here. I have no patience with those who patronize every one but their own people ; but my experience is that a good, stiff, hide-bound protectionist always reaches out with both hands for a cheap thing wherever he can get it. That being so, this proposal will fall quite as heavily upon the protectionist section of the community as it will upon any other. Those who clamour most loudly for duties upon foreign goods are the first to use them if they find it to their advantage to do so. Only the other day, when we were discussing the confectionery duties, it came out that manufacturers of confectionery in Melbourne, who were clamouring for high duties, were using Nestles milk, and not Australian milk, in their manufacture. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly not. That should only be allowed in regard to the other fellow. Without the slightest desire to encourage the sending away to other parts of the world for anything which can be reasonably done here, it seems to me we should impose a sufficiently high penalty if we adhered to the old duties. I intend to propose that we should substitute the duties under the old Tariff for those now submitted. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not think that anything created more irritation in connexion with the administration of the old Tariff than did the influx of these price lists. As honorable members are aware they accumulated in tons in the Post Office. The position I take up is very much that which is embraced by the concrete amendment suggested by the honorable member for Bendigo. We should prevent local firms sending abroad to get their advertisements printed for them, since we can command sufficient skill and ability in the Commonwealth to meet all reasonable requirements in this direction. But to impose a heavy charge upon the admission of trade catalogues which reach us from all parts of the world would be to restrict the information required by the ordinary trader, the need for which has been felt so very much. The comprehensive letters "n.e.i." appear much too frequently in the amended proposal of the Minister. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">The amendment suggested by the honorable member for Bendigo would certainly be much more definite, and the Minister would be well advised if he accepted it. I wish to emphasize what has been said by the honorable member for Grey with respect to catalogues for public libraries and galleries. I am glad that the authorities of these institutions communicated with so influential a. member of the Committee. They have also communicated with me. The authorities of the public libraries in Sydney, Brisbane, and Adelaide, as well as in Melbourne, join in a representation that in accordance with the custom, followed without exception in every country in the world, information of this character intended for the benefit of the public should be admitted free. I suggest to the honorable member for Grey that it would be well for him to move the insertion of some exclusive provision which would embrace the whole of the items to which he has referred. </para>

From that point of view, I should like the honorable member for Bendigo to think over the matter, and see what his amendment means, because it is extending my proposal very considerably. </para>

                        <para>- I think the general catalogues might come in at a small rate of duty. I wish to draw the Treasurer's attention to the fact that calendars and almanacs, n.e.i., appear in item 353, under a 30 per cent. duty. They are practically the same as the articles included in paragraph  a  of item 352. Many patent medicine proprietaries send out what are virtually their price lists in the shape of calendars and almanacs. There is really no difference between calendars and almanacs of that kind, and the other articles enumerated by the Treasurer. They are out of place in section 353, and ought to be treated in the same way as are the price lists of foreign houses. </para>

                    <para>. - I notice that included in the Minister's amendment are " printed bags and cartons." Cartons mean empty cardboard cases. On those things the duty is tremendous- from 200 to 300 per cent. The object is to make the duty on those articles the justification for the subsequent duty on strawboard.' That is really the process that is going to be worked. These cartons are to be made practically unimportable, and then the strawboard maker will say, " The makers of cardboard boxes have been given a high protection, and therefore you can give me the increase of 150 per cent, that I ask for on the old duty." This proposal has been very simply introduced, and I did not notice the mention of bags and cartons until I got a copy of the amendment. It is to be a buttress for the increased duty on strawboard. The strawboard maker will be able to argue, " The increased duty on strawboard will not injure the boxmaker, as the goods that, would compete with him are excluded." But the ultimate effect will be that the strawboard maker will be so securely entrenched that he can get any increase of price right up to the cost of the imported article under the  150  per cent, increase of duty. He will be invincibly entrenched; and the strawboard boxmakers will have to pay the increased price. But the latter are told: " Although you do pay this increased price, you cannot 'be competed with,, because you are given a duty of 6d. per lb. on your manufactured article, and this absolutely excludes competition." What is the effect? These strawboard boxes are used only when they can be sold at a price very near: to that of the paper wrappings or packages previously used, and immediately the price is raised the demand will be decreased, with the result of loss of employment. And why is this done? In order to give greater employment in a trade which, according to the proprietor of the Broadford Mill - the only mill producing strawboard im the Commonwealth - gave employment in  1902  to only thirty-one men and seven boys. </para>

Whether the' Minister's intention is .or is not what I have stated, the effect will be an increase of the duty on strawboard, and the strawboard boxmakers who complain' so bitterly about the increased duty on their raw material will be protected by a prohibitive duty. </para>

However, I leave the question of intention aside, and merely point to what will be the effect, lt may be thought that under this arrangement the strawboard boxmakers will have nothing to complain of ; but, as a matter of fact, their trade will be seriously affected, because, as I said before, cardboard boxes are used only when the price is close to that of ordinary paper packages.

                        <para>- Probably so. In reference to bags I may say that, when I was -Minister of Trade and Customs, I had considerable trouble, seeing that some bags were imported plain and others came in printed with advertisements. If the amendment suggested by the honorable member for North Sydney be made, printed matter, as well as plain bags, will be imported free, although the policy is to stop he importation- of advertisements. I happen to know a good deal about this subject, because, when Minister of Trade and Customs, I was compelled to take legal advice, which was to the effect that I was entitled to charge duty on the printing on the bags. I hope honorable members will not agree to the proposal of the honorable member for North Sydney, which opens the door to. evasion of the duty on- printed advertisements.  </para>

                    <para>. - I sincerely hope that the Committee will not be influenced by the blandishments of the honorable member for North Sydney. The honorable member must be well aware that the duty proposed on strawboard is quite insufficient, and that, if the duty immediately before us be agreed to, it will be necessary later on. if we are to have true protection, to take some such step as he has indicated. At any rate, when we do reach the item of strawboard, I shall endeavour to induce the Treasurer to raise the duty above that proposed in the schedule. If every time we endeavour to impose an effective duty, we are to be stormed at by the Opposition, we shall be kept here not only until this Christmas, but until the Christmas following. It is our duty, as a protectionist Parliament, to see that effective duties are imposed. </para>

Whilst I admit that we cannot manufacture certain classes of paper in the Commonwealth because we have not the necessary pulp, I contend that for the manufacture of strawboard we possess the raw material in abundance. Unlike the honorable member for Parramatta, and the honorable member for North Sydney, I wish to insure the payment of reasonable wages to our Australian operatives, and it is impossible to achieve that result whilst our markets remain open to the cheap production of other parts of the world. </para>

                    <para>We have the honour to submit to you the recommendations of the Master Printers' Association of Victoria, The Paper Manufacturers, The Cardboard Box Makers, The Paper Bag Makers, The Manufacturing Stationers, the Paper merchants of Victoria,, in reference to items affecting Paper, Printing and Stationery, in your proposed Tariff. We indorse the Government's proposals with the inclusion of " Printed Bags and Cartons," with the exception of Magazines. We do not think that Magazines would be produced in Australia, so we do not see the necessity for this duty, especially is the case with " Trade and Scientific Journals." We suggest therefore that clause  c  should read " Printed matter n.e.i. including printed bags and cartons (except newspapers registered for transmission through the post as magazines), 6d. per lb." </para>

                    <para>. - The Treasurer has confirmed the statement which I made in reference to this matter. A few moments ago he told us that the Comptroller-General of Customs knew nothing whatever about this arrangement. Yet we now know that it was put in black and white, months ago. Will the Treasurer now say that he knew nothing about it ? After having denied my statement point blank, the honorable gentleman rose, and read a letter which confirmed it. The honorable member for Melbourne Ports made one remark to which I should like to refer. He said that unlike the honorable member for North Sydney and myself, he wanted to Insure the payment of -good wages to the employes in this industry. Does he mean to imply that we do not ? Let me tell him that I have done more to secure the payment of good wages to employes than he will accomplish in his life-time. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member appears to be particularly active this morning. I congratulate him upon having recovered his vigour. I wish to make only one remark in reference to the agreement which has been forwarded to the Minister in respect of this item. It was discussed during the last week-end, and I understand that the manufacturers of strawboard agreed with the card-box makers to accept a lower duty than that proposed in the Tariff. The Treasurer, however, has gone back upon the arrangement, and desires to get the highest duty possible. I have been told that the whole thing has been discussed many times between the card-box makers and the strawboard manufacturers. The present proposal is a part of the arrangement arrived at between them. Nobody suggests that the Treasurer was a party to it. I hope that he will believe that these arrangements can be made without his knowledge. </para>

                        <para>- Nobody suggests that the Treasurer has been discussing this matter with these individuals. But the fact remains that he has proposed what they requested him to propose some months ago. The arrangement has been discussed more than once lately; but as they could not agree amongst themselves, each of the parties has been left to act as it pleases. </para>

The real object of this proposal is not to protect our printing establishments, but to protect our strawboard manufacturers. </para>

                    <para>. - I am very glad that the honorable "member for Parramatta has changed his ground in regard to this particular duty. When the honorable member for North Sydney first made his statement it impressed me somewhat. I thought that it implied that some arrangement had been arrived at between the Government and certain manufacturers. But now we have an entirely different story. We find that a perfectly legitimate request was made three months ago - a request to which the Government have acceded. Anybody who knows anything about the manufacture of these articles must realize the enormous competition to which our manufacturers are subjected by reason of importations from oversea. I am speaking particularly of illustrated calendars. When these arrive here, nothing remains to be done except to print upon them the name of the person who has ordered them. Under these circumstances we are entitled to extend to those who do that work in Australia, a full measure of protection. With respect to cartons, I say, without fear of contradiction, that those made in Australia from our own strawboard are equal to those produced in any part of the world. The honorable member for Lang made some reference to the quality of Australian strawboard. I do not pretend to be an expert </para>

                        <para>- The fruit-growers have to import the paper cut to the proper size. As one boy with an up-to-date guillotine could cut all the paper to size, it is not worth our while to bother about what labour would be employed, if the paper were cut on the spot, instead of abroad. Any proposal to limit the size of the paper with a view to getting it cut in Australia is really ridiculous. Under paragraph a of this item every fruit-grower would be liable to a duty of 6d. per lb. upon imported fruit-wrappers bearing his name. </para>

                        <para>- The paragraph includes " all printed or lithographed matter to be used for purposes of advertising." If a man had his name printed on his fruit-wrappers, it would be regarded by the Department as printed matter to be used for advertising purposes. Unless the paragraph is amended, it will undo what some of us have been trying to achieve, and that is to induce our fruit-growers to export their fruit 'in wrappers bearing their own names, with a view to acquiring an outside reputation as the growers of first-class fruit. </para>

Surely there can be no objection to a' man putting his name on the paper in" which he wraps his product? I impress upon the honorable gentleman that it is not possible to get these wrappers printed here, and, as he is aware, I speak as one who has had considerable experience of the printing trade. If the paper were imported and cut here the growers could not afford to have their names printed on the wrappers because the expense would be too great. </para>

                        <para>- No; it is imported in small squares ready to be used. I have been exerting all my influence to get the growers to have their names printed on the wrappers so that they may acquire a reputation as the exporters of good articles, but if this paragraph is passed in its present form, they will not use such wrappers, because it would be far too expensive to get the paper cut and printed here. These wrappers are used for not only apples but also lemons and oranges. I may inform the Treasurer that a large quantity of this wrapping paper is now in transit for use during the coming season. </para>

                <para class="block">I begin to wonder whether it might not be better to hand over the Tariff to these outside people and allow them to enact it as well as  frame  it. This is about the most curious circular I have ever seen. We have these proposals made outside and submitted here without a blush. The Master Printers say " We have agreed to these duties," and therefore I presume that Parliament has just to say "ditto," and, hey ! presto ! the thing is done. I have always imagined that this was a deliberative assembly. </para>

                        <para>- It seems that all we have to do is to register, to crystallize, the decisions of interested persons. I do not pretend to know very much about a number of these items, and therefore I am always glad to get information from any quarter. But when we are furnished with a circular stating that this,, that and the other have been agreed to at a private meeting, and that, therefore, there is an end of the matter, I venture to suggest to honorable members that this Parliament has a higher function to perform than the mere registration  of decrees which have been issued outside. We are npt here to put on the statute-book some ukase issued by interested individuals, but to exercise our "discretion, and to make the best possible arrangement in the interests of those who consume the goods which are made dutiable with so much alacrity, and with so little compunction as regards the consequences to their pockets. </para>

                    <para>.- I wish to make a personal explanation. On the last division relating to the omission of the word " cartons," I inadvertently voted, forgetting that I had arranged to pair with the honorable member for Gwydir, from item  320  until his return to-morrow. The whip had not been acquainted of this arrangement, and, therefore, could not remind me of it. Fortunately, the division related only to the omission of a word, and not to any duty, but I thought it due to the honorable member for Gwydir to make this explanation. </para>

                    <para>. - I would point out to the honorable member for Parramatta that if the amendment of the amendment which he proposes were carried, it would give rise to complications. The original amendment includes the words " frames including the weight of the frames," and the honorable member's proposal would, therefore, conflict with the decision already arrived at. The proper course for the honorable member to pursue would have been to move the omission of certain words in the amendment. I did not realize this at the time, or I should have advised him accordingly. </para>

                    <para>. - I agree with the honorable member for Parramatta that we should substitute an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> for a fixed duty.  It is unfair that the cheaper classes of goods should have to bear the same duty as is imposed upon the higher priced articles. Since I last spoke to this question, I have received from a Melbourne firm a letter stating that this duty is equal to  80  per cent. . </para>

                        <para>- The Treasurer must see that a duty of 4d. per lb. would amount to an increase of about 33 per cent, on the duty imposed under the old Tariff, and with landing charges, freight, insurance, packing and so on, would give a very y substantial protective encouragement to the printing industry in Australia. The Treasurer would be well advised to accept my suggestion, .which, I feel sure, will commend itself to the common-sense of honorable members generally. I am certain that if the Minister would fake expert advice, every unbiased and impartial printer would admit that a duty of 4d. per lb. on printed matter of this kind would give ample protection, and would be all that could reasonably be expected by those concerned in this industry.

                    <para>.- I wish to make an explanation in reference to a dispute I have had with some one who lobbied me in Parliament House. I was lobbied here by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDougall,</inline> of Sands and McDougall, and I think it is only right that honorable members should understand what occurred. Briefly. I had simply been told that he could not make the very finest qualities of coated boards, and when he came here I asked him - and it was the only question I asked him - if any evidence had been given before the Tariff Commission, and whether he would read it and let me know if he had a different view. Oh the following day I received from him this letter, which is the most insulting letter I ever received from any one in my life. </para>

                <para>I was under the impression that you were returned as the member for Melbourne as a protectionist. You therefore very much surprised me yesterday when you said that you would oppose the proposed duty of 25 per cent, on surface-coated board. </para>

                <para class="block">At present the duty on plain and coated Boards is the same. We now only ask for a protection of 15 per cent. We have invested a large sum in up-to-date plant, occupying one whole floor of our factory, and employ a large number of men in the production of _ these boards, and have continued their production in the hope that when the Tariff should be revised we would get .the protection that we are entitled to. Should we not receive that protection we will be compelled to close that department and throw all those hands out of work. It is sad to think that that result should be brought about by you, a supposed protectionist. How can you justify your action? </para>

                <para>Yours of the 7th inst. to hand. Your impression is correct. I am a protectionist. My political faith has been, and will ever be, publicly declared. I do no skulking, double-dealing, or underhand scheming. My votes embody my principles. I point to the votes I have given. </para>
                <para>But I am surprised, after lobbying me at Parliament House, you should now write me - and such a letter - a letter of craft and wile and not straightforwardness. You threaten to turn men out of work - with what object? - to frighten me ! </para>
                <para>You know the thought that " Houseless heads and unfed sides " of my fellow men and women would break my heart, if I were directly or indirectly the cause. You care nothing about them. Gain is your object. To put money in your purse you try to frighten me by conjuring before my eyes workless men and hungry children. You want money only, and I am to be but a tool in your hands - and you threaten men and women and children to influence me to vote as you desire. </para>
                <para>Ought I not admire you? Noble character, disinterested humanitarian ! </para>
                <para>Yet you are the man - you lover of protection and of workmen - who did your utmost, who hesitated at no expedient, to oust me from Parliament House and put in - who, a protectionist? No - a free-trader. Yes - wealth went to wealth. The wealthy McDougall supported the. wealthy <inline font-weight="bold">Sir M.</inline> McEacharn. Where was the poor workmen then? </para>
                <para>Now carry out your threat to dismiss your workmen if you dare. I believe that manhood and womanhood in this country will say you are not the master of their lives - that you are not as God - that to you they need not pray " Give us this day our daily work that we may earn the bread of sweat." </para>
                <para>It proves conclusively to my soul's satisfaction that the policy .of the Labour Party is the right one - the right of the man to live without being at the beck and call of his fellow man, because that man has money. With tenfold earnestness will I advocate a policy of nationalization of industries, so that the McDougalls may become as Dodos - extinct. </para>
                <para>The fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir M.</inline> McEacharn was one of the four who voted against "White Australia," and who was then an acknowledged free-trader, shows me it is not of your workmen you are thinking - black or slave does not signi'fy to you. </para>
                <para>To you your men are machinery - instruments of money-making. To me they are men with God-created souls and "rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." </para>
                <para>When the duties are considered, you may rest assured I will think of my duty to my fellowmen and to my country, Australia, and your threats will not operate' on my mind. </para>
                <para>After my experience of your lobbying, and of your letter, I deem it my duty to prevent your misunderstanding my words, or misrepresenting me, and all future communications, if any, must be in writing. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not think this incident ought to be allowed to pass unnoticed, although the highly-coloured reply of the honorable member for Melbourne may excite a little laughter. Right through the Tariff that sort of thing has been the experience not only of the honorable member for Melbourne, but of myself and others. We have been waylaid by importers' agents and manufacturers' agents. The one side is as bad as the other. . I gave short shrift to them both, for I have refused on all occasions to go into matters with them. It is only right that the Government should now intervene. The Tariff Commission sat for the purpose of getting all the necessary information from interested parties, and it should not have been necessary for the corridors of Parliament to be crowded with persons desiring to make representations. This sort of thing has been going on throughout the discussion of the Tariff, and to-day it is more marked than ever. The honorable member for Melbourne has  taken up the right position, but he has not done so a bit too soon. The honorable member for Lang mentioned <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale'</inline> s name. Although' that gentleman is a manufacturer in a large way in my electorate, I have treated him in the same way as I have treated the importers' agents. 1 only wish that every other member would do the same. Of course, those interested have a right to make representations, but they can approach honorable members by circular, instead of personally. Only to-day I received a large sheaf of circulars by post. The honorable member for Melbourne has done the best public action that we have had since the Tariff has been under consideration. Only a fortnight ago <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> was asked to intervene against the placing of exhibits in this building. If interested parties want to make exhibits, let them hire a place in Collins-street for the purpose. When the last Tariff was being considered, I said that' we appeared to be threatened with the American system of lobbying, but if the present condition of things is going to continue, what goes on in America will be only a circumstance to it. No member, whether a free-trader or protectionist, should be intimidated as to his votes. Importers' agents and manufacturers' agents should use the one channel only - by letter - and should not come to this House to make personal representations when their interests are at stake. </para>

                        <para>.- Under the old Tariff this item was free; and 1 understand that this duty is aimed at one directory which is printed outside the Commonwealth. The firm which publishes this directory employs a considerable number of people in Australia, and distributes a large amount in wages. For' three years the directory was printed in Sydney, but, at the expiration of that time, the printers declined to renew the contract, chiefly because of the limited time allowed for the printing, of such a large number of names in order that the book might be issued at the beginning of the new year. The directory to which I refer is <inline font-style="italic">Wise's Post Office Directory,</inline> and the duty proposed means an impost of 3s. 6d., the weight of each volume being 7 lbs. I understand that the printing represents only one-fourth of the cost of production, the other three-fourths being expended in Australia. This duty is proposed for the benefit of a particular firm. </para>

A comparison of this directory with the directory issued by the firm who are so anxious to have this duty imposed, may be interesting. Of forty- eight towns dealt with in <inline font-style="italic">Wise's Post Office Directory,</inline> only five are dealt with in the directory issued by Sands and McDougall. Then in <inline font-style="italic">Wise's Directory,</inline> 1,872 country postal towns are given as compared with 472 in the directory of Sands and McDougall. In regard to the number of names given, the following table affords some examples - </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps it is not so satisfactory as it ought to  be,  but it is the best  we  have had up to now. The publishers have endeavoured to get the printing done in Australia, but have failed, simply because the printers require, perhaps, nine months to do work which is required in three months. Under the circumstances, I think that the publishers are not to  be  blamed for going abroad for their printing ; and I have much pleasure in supporting the amendment of the honorable member for Grey. </para>

                            <para>- I am not endeavouring to do so, but merely pointing out that apparently importers as well as manufacturers can supply all the information necessary to promote their own interests. We have been told that philanthropic publishers spend £10,000 per annum in wages in Australia. I point out, however, that that money is obtained from Australia, before it can  be  paid as wages. We are told that the imposition of a duty of 3s. 6d.  Der  volume will stop the circulation of the directory. But can  we  believe that these publishers would "bite off their nose to spite their face " ? This is a business run on commercial lines, and while a profit can  be  made the directory will be issued. Free-traders will admit that if there is any work that can  be  done in Australia, it is a compilation of a directory of the residents of Australia. Extreme protectionist as I may be regarded, I think I am not asking too much, even from so-called free-traders, when I suggest that publications of this sort ought to be printed here. </para>

                            <para>- I* am making no accusation against the honorable member. I do not approve of lobbying ; but those interested have a perfect right to place what information they have before us, if they do so in a proper way ; and on that information honorable members may come to a conclusion. Some protectionist members will not accept any representations, simply because they come from protectionists,, and so with free-trade members in regard to representations from free-traders. They will themselves weigh the arguments advanced on either side. I think that the case put forward upon the. present occasion possesses some strength. The duty proposed is aimed entirely at one individual. </para>

                                declares that nine months is the shortest period within which he can get his work printed in Australia. If his statement be accurate, there seems to be some justification for his getting it printed elsewhere. Therefore I shall support the amendment of the honorable member for Grey. I would further point out that we admit other printed books - some of which could be printed in the Commonwealth much more easily than could a directory - free. The issue of a directory is a special class of work. Only a few firms are willing to undertake it, and it is stated they require nine months within which to print it.

                        <para>. - I understand that a deputation recently waited upon the Minister of Trade and Customs in regard to the publication of <inline font-style="italic">Wise's Directory.</inline> Upon that occasion it was stated that the work could not be printed in Australia. That assertion has been repeated by the honorable member for North Sydney, who says that the directory cannot be printed here in less than nine months, which means that it cannot be printed locally at all. The Minister of Trade and Customs promised the members of the deputation that he would make inquiries and ascertain whether the statement to which I have referred is correct. I should like him to give the Committee the result of his inquiries, and to say whether <inline font-style="italic">Wise's Directory</inline> can be printed in the Commonwealth within a reasonable period. </para>

                        <para>-~ I recollect the deputation to which the honorable member for Corio has referred. At that deputation conflicting statements were made. Of course, those who were interested in having the work done oversea made out the best case that they could. But to those who have seen the directories that are printed in Australia, it must be obvious that the work can be performed locally. As a matter of fact, a number of printers who waited upon me some time ago pointed out that this work could be done within the Commonwealth at a time when printing work was slack, and that it would thus provide employment for men who would otherwise be idle. I cannot understand the statement that nine months is required to print this directory. </para>

                        <para>.- The duty proposed might be reduced with advantage. I regret that I cannot see my way to support the amendment of the honorable member for Grey. It is idle to contend that the directory to which reference, has been made cannot be printed in Australia with advantage to everybody concerned. I will undertake to say that it can be done by any large firm. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wise</inline> chose to enter into a contract with any large firm for the production of his directory for a period of five or seven years, I am certain that he could get the work turned out within three months. It is simply a question of paying the necessary price. At the same time, I think that 6d. per lb. is rather too heavy an impost to levy upon directories. Some honorable members have argued that the publications mentioned in paragraph  a  cannot be produced in Australia to commercial advantage. But certainly directories can. There is nothing elaborate about them. They involve only ordinary plain setting. It is ridiculous to suggest that the publisher can economize time by sending his copy oversea, thus sacrificing six weeks upon the voyage each way. </para>

In the circumstances I shall support the imposition of the duty, believing that not to do so would be to do an injustice to our printing establishments, which are turning out most excellent work, and which, if afforded the opportunity, would turn out this additional work creditably. </para>

                        <para>.- In my opinion, a duty of 6d. per lb. is too high.' I do not know whether the honorable member for Coolgardie intends to propose a reduction of the duty, but I certainly mean to vote against the amendment of the honorable member for Grey. I am informed that a great quantity of this work is done in Germany. I know, as a matter of fact, that similar work is done there. If it be a fact that these directories are printed in Germany, or elsewhere, I do not see why we should not give a small preference to the United Kingdom, and I suggest to the Treasurer that if the amendment before the Committee be rejected" the, duty per lb. should be fixed at 6d. in the general Tariff, and at 4d. in the preferential Tariff. That, I think, would meet the case very well.  </para>

This is an anomaly, and one which I find it very difficult to defend. During the consideration of the old Tariff it was made an argument for the abolition of all duties on what is known as printing newspaper.

I hold in my hand a copy of <inline font-style="italic">Munsey's Magazine,</inline> containing  269  pages of advertisements and  138  pages of magazine matter. It is the most ridiculous thing that it is possible for any one to imagine. At one time I used to be very glad, each month, to get the magazines to read the really good matter in them, but now, with their small proportion of reading matter, they are really not worth reading. They are advertising mediums, and nothing else. </para>

When I was Minister of Trade and Customs, prior to the Reid Ministry coming into power, I found that it had reached the proportions of a scandal. It was such an imposition upon those who were paying practically for advertisements, that <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> decided that if the magazines contained more than one-third of advertisements, they should pay the duty The proportion fixed - one-third of advertisements - is very fair. Ever since I did this the importers of magazines have been agitating and ear-wigging every member of Parliament they could get hold of, with the object of having these duties taken off. </para>

If I wanted to get an honorable member to support me, I would ask him to do so. I did not make the . remark of which the honorable member has complained offensively, and did not intend it to bear the meaning which some people outside would give to it. It is a scandal to permit the free importation of magazines such as the one I hold in my hand, when they contain so many pages of advertisements and so few of reading matter. </para>

                        <para>.- The Treasurer in his rather remarkable speech seems to have quite misunderstood the .point at issue, or has been incapable of stating his case in such a way as to commend it to honorable members who are accustomed - in spite of the fact that he has been permitted to be in charge of. this Tariff for a considerable time - to have cases presented to them in a logical manner. The honorable gentleman says that it is desirable to foster art and literature. No doubt it is; but if that be the object which he has in view, I ask: What . earthly connexion is there between a number of advertisements which he declines to be allowed to be 'attached to <inline font-style="italic">Munsey's Magazine</inline> and the fostering of literature and art? The whole gravamen of the Treasurer's charge is that these magazines are accompanied by quantities of advertisements. If they are cut out he has no objection to allowing the magazines to come in. Therefore, his objection is to the advertisements, not to the literature and art of foreign countries. As to the honorable gentleman's remarks about lobbying - which, of course, are made rather late in the day, and when the precincts of this chamber are full of exhibits of various kinds - I remind him that not very ' long ago he came down to this House with a sheep-shearing machine, the driving gear of which occupied the lobby and which he said was made in Australia when, as a matter of fact, it was imported. We have not heard the Treasurer taking exception to men coming here day after day and stating their case -to honorable members. A hundred of them have tried to speak to me, but few have been successful. I should be very sorry if I could not present a case better than the Treasurer has done on this occasion. The magazine which he has exhibited is an American magazine - <inline font-style="italic">Munsey's.</inline> The American magazines, without exception, differ from the English magazines in the number of advertisements which they contain. I take up half-a-dozen English magazines, and find hardly any advertisements in them. Now, I am perfectly prepared to listen to a proposal in favour of excluding the literature and art of all foreign countries, on the ground that it is desirable to foster literature and art in Australia. But I am not to be influenced, by foolish f  fulminations against advertisements contained in foreign magazines, and which come in merely incidentally. I am sure that some of us enjoy reading the advertisements in magazines. There is no greater evidence at once of the ingenuity and the credulity of mankind than can be found in reading the advertisements in the American magazines. But the literary men of Australia do not want to exclude magazines because of their advertisements. They want to exclude them - if they have any such desire at all - because they have their own brains to sell here. But the Minister in charge of this Tariff does not want to exclude American magazines for that reason. They are to be permitted as magazines to come in; but their advertisements are to be cut out. That is an illogical and senseless position to take up. The Treasurer seems to think that literature" and art can be dealt with on the basis of so much per pound - that works over a certain weight ought to be excluded, whilst those under a certain weight should be admitted free. He appears to think that literature is a thing that is capable of being weighed and measured. </para>

                            <para>- I certainly agree that the contents of some magazines are very trivial and foolish, but I should be sorry to think that we are guilty of the intolerable assumption that we do not require all that the intellect of foreign countries can give us. Half-a-dozen magazines which I have in mind have, perhaps, only half-a-dozen pages of advertisements as against thirty or forty pages of general reading matter. The Treasurer has said a great deal on the question of preference to Great Britain, but this is an opportunity which I am sure he will not avail himself of to grant a preference to the Old Country, because according to him advertisements alone are <inline font-style="italic">anathema.</inline> If he excludes only those magazines in which advertisements preponderate he will allow British magazines to come in at a cheaper rate. I hope that the Committee will determine that magazines shall come in free. </para>

                            <para>- The use of linotypes has largely reduced the cost of printing; but the newspaper proprietors have given the public a substantial equivalent by increasing the size of their news columns. The Melbourne and Sydney newspapers, the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian,</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane .Courier</inline> are magnificent literary productions, unequalled in the world. If printing paper in rolls is taxed at the rate of  10  per cent., the proprietors of these newspapers will probably have to. economize by reducing their Saturday supplements. </para>

                            <para>- I protest on behalf of the proprietors of these newspapers against any duty on paper used for printing newspapers, and particularly against any discrimination between paper imported in rolls and paper imported flat or in sheets. Such a discrimination  would stand in the way of those who, for the sake of economy, and to keep pace with the times, may desire hereafter to use paper imported in rolls. My objection to the Government proposal is that it is a tax on literature, which, in the end, will bring loss upon the public. </para>

That is signed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Frank</inline> Clarke and Senators Higgs and McGregor. There was apparently a difference of opinion between them and the  Chairman  of the Tariff Commission, who did not sign the report which was signed by the other three protectionist members of the Commis-sion. Then I come to the report of the B section of the Tariff Commission, who unanimously recommended a duty of 10 per cent. That is how the duty of 10 per cent, came to be placed in the first column of this Tariff. I recognise that we have not so far found in Australia a sufficient supply of softwoods or other material suitable for the manufacture of this paper, in view of the large quantity of it that is required. We have paper mills in the Commonwealth, one in Sydney and one, I believe, in Geelong. I have made inquiry as to whether this class of paper is manufactured here, and so far as I can gather it is not. </para>

                            <para>- The roll paper is imported chiefly from Canada. If this paper is made in England, it must be from imported pulp. From recent cables honorable members will have observed that in the United States it has been suggested that wood pulp for the manufacture of paper should be admitted duty free. There is an evident shortage of" material. The great Canadian forests have so far been able to meet the demand for wood pulp, but I have not been surprised to hear that the action of the United States in proposing the free admission of wood pulp has been met in Canada by a proposal to impose an export duty upon it. British manufacturers have, so far, been importing, wood pulp from Sweden, where there are extensive softwood forests. No attempt has been made in Australia to manufacture this paper, because we have no softwoods suitable for the purpose. In the circumstances this can only be regarded as  a  revenue duty. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think we could <inline font-style="italic">get it.</inline> If an export duty were imposed in the countries from which it comes, it would probably add so much to the cost of manufacturing the paper here that the local newspaper proprietors would prefer to pay the duty to paying the price which would have to be charged by local manufacturers of this paper from imported wood pulp. The honorable member for Bendigo appeared to think that this class of paper is used only for the printing of newspapers. But I can inform him that it is largely used for job printing as well as for dodgers. I know of one job done recently which involved the use of 10 tons of paper, and the printing was done from the roll. </para>

                            <para>- No, it is not. I am guided in this matter by a definite principle. On this occasion the country has said that we should have protective duties. I have been fighting . for them, and I am opposed absolutely on principle to revenue duties. I wish that those things which cannot be made here should be admitted free, and there is no doubt that we cannot make this class of paper. The Treasurer has said something about rushes. But I wonder how long the greatest field of rushes in Australia would last if drawn upon for this purpose, and how long the rushes would take to grow again. </para>

                            <para>- I suppose that the whole of the rushes grown in Australia would be used up in the manufacture of the paper  required to print a couple of issues of one of our large daily newspapers. The search for material suitable for the manufacture of printing papers of this class has been the business of busy brains in every part of the world. So far the greatest quantity has been' derived from soft-wood forests. Canada has almost a monopoly of woods suitable for the purpose. I can support the statement made by the honorable member for Bendigo that an increasing number of newspapers are being printed from the roll. The use of the Cox duplex machine,  which does not cost anything like the Hoe printing machine, is enabling a number of the proprietors of country newspapers to print from the roll. </para>

                        <para>. - I take the same view of this matter as does the honorable member for Darling. This is a purely revenue duty, and I cannot see my way to vote for it. I admit, of course, that revenue must be derived in some way for the services of the Commonwealth, while the Braddon blot is allowed to remain. I hope that the wisdom of this House and another place combined will shortly lead to the removal of the Braddon blot. So far as is known at present, wood pulp suitable for the manufacture of this paper cannot be obtained in Australia. I am not sure that a suitable material will not yet be discovered, and I suggest to the Minister that the production of a pulp suitable for the manufacture of paper would be a fitting subject for a bounty. I find from a communication placed in my hands by a gentleman who has had much experience that wood pulp for this purpose is obtained from large forests of larch and spruce,  and comes principally from Canada, the United States, Norway, and Sweden. I know of one newspaper - <inline font-style="italic">Le Petit Journal,</inline> which, at the time to which I refer, had the largest circulation in the world, 1,500,000 subscribers - of which it was said that every year it ate out a forest in Norway. I am informed that logs of New Zealand pine were sent to England and the Continent in. order to see if they could be made into a pulp suitable for the manufacture of this paper, but the experiments show that they could not be used for this purpose in the same way as the soft wood, such as the larch and spruce. I understand that if larch and spruce were planted here, it would take twenty years before they could be used for this purpose. Another difficulty is that these trees are found in countries in which there is heavy frost and snow, and it would appear that intense cold is necessary for their proper development. To import pulp is almost out of the question. One cannot verify information on these subjects by personal observation, but if my information be correct, and I think it is, pulp, to be imported here, would require to be  50  per cent, dry, or one-half water and one-half, pulp. </para>

                    <para>To import pulp is out of the question. Wood pulp can be carried only in what is called a condition 50 per cent, dry - half pulp and half water. The freight alone on the pulp necessary to make a ton of paper, even at the most favorable sailing ship rate of 15s. a ton measure, would amount to over 60s. per ton, in addition to charges for insurance, exchange, &amp;C. In a long voyage of 90 to 100 days, pulp would considerably deteriorate, owing to its tendency to decompose. If it dried to any extent, the material would lose its fibrous quality and become mere powder, from which only the coarsest paper could be made; </para>

If T. thought there was a hundred to one chance of manufacturing newspaper and printing paper in Australia I should vote for the highest duty I could get, but. having been assured by those in the trade that it could not be done, I intend to vote to make this article free. I know there is a feeling  -  I must: admit that I have it myself - that it would lie well to make some people pay. a little bit more taxation than they are paying just now ; but. seeing that that would be stretch&gt;ing my belief as a protectionist, I am willing to let it go.

                            <para>- Very well. I wish to impress upon the Treasurer, and upon honorable members, that in taking up this attitude I am not " slipping " on paper. I have assured myself that this paper has not been and cannot be made here. The Minister has admitted that the production of pulp requires encouragement by means of the bounty system, and I believe that he himself will place it upon the bounty list. I believe the House would indorse that, seeing that the paper question involves such large interests. As the pulp is not produced here, and our timber is not suitable for pulping, I shall vote against the duty on newspaper and printing paper. </para>

                            <para>- I have a great deal of material, with which I could go on for an hour ; but out of consideration for the Treasurer and the Committee I shall deny myself the privilege of saying much about this question, except that I rather favour the amendment, moved by the honorable member for Moreton, to delete all the words after the word "folios," so that the paragraph may apply to all sizes of printing paper. Why should newspaper be made free, in sizes not less than 20 inches x 25 inches, or its equivalent - because I am quite satisfied that it will be made free - while all smaller sizes are penalized? The smaller sizes are used in various ways for books, particularly school books. Printing paper of all sizes should be made free. </para>

This line of demarcation is necessary'; and, despite what the honorable member for Bendigo has said, absolutely just. Those newspaper proprietors who use paper in reels or rolls will pay a duty of 10 per cent., while those who use paper in the flat in the publication of small country newspapers will obtain it free of duty ; and thus the object of the honorable member for Moreton will be gained. I take some exception to the honorable member for Bendigo commenting on . this amendment before I had an opportunity to speak on it. The honorable member was very eloquent in his appeal on behalf of the smaller newspaper proprietors, and he described the daily press of Bendigo and Ballarat as country newspapers. </para>

                            <para>- I do not consider Bendigo and Ballarat country towns, but provincial cities ; and the newspapers there are very fine publications indeed. The honorable member also informed us that there are 1,000 newspapers published in Australia, but he did not add that the proposed tax will not touch more than 2 per cent, or 3 per cent, of them - that the proprietors who use paper in reels or rolls can be counted on the fingers of both hands. There are three or four such proprietors in Sydney, about three in Melbourne, two in Adelaide, two in Perth, two or three in Brisbane, and, it may be, there are others in Newcastle, Rockhampton, and perhaps Charters Towers. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think so. Unless a newspaper has a very large circulation it does not pay to instal. the machinery necessary in the use of reel paper. I appeal to honorable members who desire to give country newspapers fair play. The other day we imposed a tax of 20 per cent, on type, while, at the same time, we made- linotypes and other printing machinery free. </para>

                            <para>- No; but I think every class in the community ought to pay their due share to the revenue. The honorable member for Bendigo also declared that we have no timber in Australia suitable for pulp for the manufacture of paper. I point out that if the proposed duty be imposed, the large consumers will no doubt put their heads together, and endeavour to discover here some substitute for the foreign timber, When I hear vaunted protectionists like the honorable member for Melbourne Ports and the honorable member for Melbourne slating that newspaper cannot be manufactured here, and that, therefore, no duty should be imposed; I marvel at their short-sightedness, because, after all, necessity is the mother of invention. If the. large newspaper proprietors are allowed to dose other people with taxes, and impose heavy duties on country newspapers, while enjoying free-trade themselves, they will never have any spur or incentive to discover in Australia a substitute for the foreign paper. I advise the honorable members to whom I have referred to reconsider their position before their constituents. As I have said, the country newspaper proprietor pays a duty on his type, while the large newspaper proprietor of the city has his linotype and other expensive machinery admitted free. There is one metropolitan newspaper proprietor who draws between £60,000 and ^70,000 a year from his newspaper; and he, and other wealthy proprietors, are to be free of taxation, while the poor country printer, who often employs his sons and daughters picking up type when they ought to be at school, is taxed on everything he uses. The honorable member for Bendigo spoke of advantages which he says readers of newspapers have been given by the proprietors since the introduction of the linotype. I deny the honorable member's statement flatly. I shall take one case in proof. If we look up a Saturday issue of the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of twenty years ago, we shall find that it compares more than favorably in literary work with the Saturday <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of to-day. That was long before the linotype was introduced ; and the same remark applies to the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> or the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph.</inline></para>

                            <para>- That is true, but there were id. newspapers to which the remark applies, at any rate in a modified way. The reduction in the cost of production owing to the linotype has enabled newspaper proprietors to make enormous fortunes ; and neither the remuneration of the staffs, nor the advantages given to readers, are in any way proportionate to the increased profits. I challenge the honorable member for (Tend Bendigo to successfully refute what I say. Twenty years ago the daily newspapers of Australia maintained two cable services from England, but there is now a syndicate service for the whole, and thereby considerable saving. These savings and economies have in no way advantaged the readers of the newspapers ; nor. as I say. have the staffs had their position materially improved. I regret very much that there should have been such lengthy discussion on this item, but I intend dividing the Committee on the question. </para>

                        No; I do not think a preferential duty would do much good. A good deal of the reel paper comes from Great Britain, but the countries of origin are not British. I wish it to be clearly understood that my amendment contemplates that the paper used by the small country newspaper proprietors shall still be admitted free.

The honorable member mentioned Rockhampton, and other coastal towns, and classed the newspapers there with the great metropolitan dailies. But I entirely disapprove of any .step being taken which would impose heavy burdens on struggling newspaper proprietors, who are ill prepared to bear them. Bundaberg, Rockhampton, Maryborough, and other places are growing in. importance ; and there came under my notice the other day a newspaper which has just been changed into a daily. </para>

The honorable member said that the newspaper proprietors who use this roll paper could .be counted on the fingers of both hands; but, as a matter of fact, it is used by many more, and numbers of them are by no means wealthy. In all the towns which have been mentioned newspapers' .have been started bv enterprising men in the face of great difficulties, and yet, in his anxiety to tax the large proprietors, the honorable member is prepared to put a heavy impost on the paper required by men who are doing good work for the country. Some of these newspapers are excellent publications, providing good news at considerable expense, though the proprietors are just managing to scrape along, faced, in some cases, no doubt, with .overdrafts incurred in improving their plants. </para>

                            <para>- Whether the honorable member has or has not succeeded in doing so, I decline to have anything to do with class taxation of any description. We ought to treat the big proprietors of the cities with the same fairness and justice that we extend to the proprietors of small weekly newspapers; even a big newspaper proprietor has a right to expect that at the hands of the Committee. It is all very well for the honorable member to say that we propose to let the big city newspaper proprietor escape taxation, whilst taxing the small newspaper proprietor in the country. As a matter of fact, we wish to do nothing of the kind. We intend, I hope, to give all newspaper proprietor's their printing paper free. I need not enumerate the reasons why this commodity should be free. But I wish to reply to the statement made by the honorable member for Coolgardie as to what is going on in other parts of the world. Two months .ago I read in a British newspaper that in New York a movement was in progress to requisition the .United States Government to remit the duty upon wood' pulp. </para>

                            <para>- I am speaking pf a movement which was in progress two. months ago. Already the duties imposed under this division of the Tariff are injuring our Australian publishers, who, I am told, are forwarding their books to London to be made up there. It may be that the time will come when we shall be able to convert the rushes grown in Tas-  mania, of which the Treasurer spoke, into newspaper, but even if we could do that I do not know whether there is an unlimited supply available. It seems to me that if all the rushes grown in Tasmania were utilized for the purpose they would not keep a huge newspaper mill running very long. The prospects in that direction are, therefore, very small indeed. This newspaper problem is becoming a very serious one all over the world. There is no doubt that the supplies of pine wood, from which the pulp is made, are becoming exhausted, and already the industry is in the hands of one or two individuals. Even if we impose a tax upon printing newspaper we shall not stimulate enterprise in the direction of finding an efficient substitute for pine. It will be a tax pure and simple, and we ought not to impose a burden upon newspaper proprietors for the sake of levying taxation. I think that printing paper ought to be admitted free, inasmuch as it is the raw material of the printer's finished product. </para>

A number of items have been included in the Tariff for reasons which have never been explained, and this is one of them. I sympathize with the proposal of the honorable member for Coolgardie, but cannot see that there is any justification for proposing a tax upon newspaper. I shall vote in favour of the item being made free. </para>

                        <para>.- I think that the Government are quite justified in challenging the opinion of the Committee upon this item, because no less than seven out of eight members of the Tariff Commission recommended the imposition of a duty upon this class of paper. There is no reason, however, why that recommendation should be accepted by the Committee. I should like to remind the honorable member for Coolgardie that, in voting for the free admission of newspaper rolls, honorable members will not be voting solely in the interests of the great metropolitan newspapers alone. In Sydney there are twelve newspapers and other publications using these rolls-- </para>

                        <para>.- I have very grave doubts whether the amendment of the honorable member for Coolgardie would have the effect of taking a single penny out of the pockets of the large newspaper proprietaries. All of these firms are in a position to pass on the duty. That is their policy. As is well known, the mere cost of the paper actually used in the production of a big daily newspaper exceeds the price which the public pay for it. But it must be recollected that the city newspapers can command larger prices for advertising space than can country journals. The latter cannot obtain anything like the same rates. Any tax that we may impose upon printing paper will be passed on to the advertisers, who in turn will pass it on to the consumers. For these reasons I hope that the Government proposal will be defeated. </para>

                        <para>.- I am sorry that this item is not the first or second item in the Tariff. Had it been we might have been in a position to take to heart the injunction of the honorable member for Bendigo. He has told us that seven out of the eight members of the Tariff Commission recommended the imposition of a duty upon printing paper, but that that was no reason why the Committee should accept their recommendation.  His  words should be written up in large letters. Again and again he has urged that the recommendations of the Tariff Commission should be upheld. Yet here is an item upon which he advises the Committee to vote against its finding. </para>

The fair way is to take a vote on the proposal of the honorable member for Coolgardie, which I will oppose, because I think that if a duty is to be imposed at all it should be levied all round; and then, if that proposal is defeated, as probably it will be, to take a straight-out vote on the proposal of the honorable member for Parramatta. The Government desire an opportunity to vote for the item as it is printed, and if that is given we can' get a. straight-out vote as to whether or nor that class of paper shall be made free. </para>

                            <para>- I like the business to be conducted in order, but so far as I can see that is not being done. I do not want, nor does the Government want, to vote with the honorable member for Coolgardie to give a preference to one section of the press, but the amendment of the honorable member for Parramatta makes it imperative for me to vote for or against one section of the press. I do not want to vote to make the duty of  10  per cent, stand as regards only a. part of the press. </para>

                            <para>- Owing to the way in which the question will be put, a number of honorable members will probably vote for the amendment of the honorable member for Parramatta, although they do not approve of it. It is very unfair to place us in that position. It is not a straight way of raising the issue. If the honorable member wished to let us have a straight-out vote he would ask leave to withdraw his amendment for the time being. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps I can shorten the discussion somewhat. The whole matter appears to me to be quite plain and simple. We have paragraph  d  before us. The honorable member for Coolgardie desires to substitute some other words.  His  original intention was to propose to omit the item altogether, with a view of inserting another one. But the Department of Trade and Customs have hitherto found it necessary, to enable the Tariff to be properly administered, to have words added to items so that the existing duty may be collected up to to-day and the new one from to-morrow. The object of the amendment of the honorable member for Coolgardie is quite simple. He has moved to add ' ' printing paper known as newspaper, in rolls or reels, to be used exclusively for newspapers under departmental by-laws, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> 10 per cent." He therefore desires that on and after to-morrow 10 per cent, shall be collected on such paper. The honorable member for Parramatta desires that such paper shall be admitted free. Therefore, he has moved to omit the words " <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem,</inline> 10 per cent." with a view of inserting in lieu thereof the word "free." If the Treasurer desires that the duty shall be 10 per cent., he must vote to retain that rate of duty in the amendment of the honorable member for Coolgardie. </para>

                            <para>- We cannot help that. Honorable members occasionally have to vote differently from what they might prefer to do. Unfortunately, the rules under which we are working do not always permit us to vote exactly as we should like. If the duty of 10 per cent, were retained the Treasurer could, if he chose, vote to knock out the whole item, and then some other honorable member could move that on and after such and such a date the goods be free. . </para>

                        <para>.- I must confess that after the Treasurer's long explanation I am still unable to discover where his difficulty lies. He has stated clearly that he is against ' the amendment of the honorable member for Parramatta, who wishes to make this paper free. He is quite clear that he is also against the amendment of the honorable member for Coolgardie. It is therefore quite easy for him to vote first against the amendment of the honorable member for Parramatta and then against the amendment of the honorable member for Coolgardie. If they are defeated the honorable member can vote in favour of his own proposal. The procedure is simplicity itself. The main question is whether this paper shall be free or dutiable. That will lie the first test. The Treasurer need not be afraid of being put in a false position. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot see why. I have tried to discover the Treasurer's difficulty, and do not think that it exists. Those who believe that the goods should be free can vote with the honorable member for Parramatta; those who believe in a duty will vote against him. If the honorable member for Parramatta is defeated the Treasurer can move for a higher duty if he likes. He will have the Committee in his own hands if he can defeat the honorable member for Parramatta. </para>

                        <para>.- The impression that I derived from the oration of the Treasurer was that he feared lest the proposal of his own Government should by any mischance be carried. My belief is that no one would regret it more than he would if the proposal of the Government were agreed to. So far as I am concerned, I intend to vote that these goods be free. I think that there should be no differentiation. At a later stage I also intend to propose that ordinary printing paper be free. I can see no complication about our procedure. The honorable member for Coolgardie has presented his case very clearly, and I do not think that there is any difficulty as to how honorable members wish to vote. </para>

                            <para>- I have never attacked the Treasurer. I have always defended his personal honour. I have never said an unkind word about him, and when any other honorable member has attacked him I have always defended him. But I say that he is the last man who should make such an insinuation as he has done, because, if he insinuates against others, others will insinuate against him. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think they ought to do it. This Parliament should be above conduct of that sort. The Treasurer should be above baseless insinuations, and if he makes them others will do the same. He ought not to set a bad example The Treasurer should have put up a big fight on this question if he really wants the  duty. But there is a vague idea that the Government do not want the item carried. It has been left for the honorable member for Coolgardie to defend the item. If the Government were in earnest they should have said that they would stand or fall by the item. Why not make the stand of their life about it if they really believe in it. But we have had the Treasurer for three-quarters of an hour orating about a point qf order and practically dragging a red herring across the trail. If he had only devoted that time, and the powerful oratory and argumentative ability which he possesses and can use when he Likes to defending this item, it would not have mattered about the point of order - he could have had his own way on the main issue. </para>

                        <para>.- The Government proposition places a limitation on the extent of the taxation on paper, and the honorable member for Coolgardie proposes to impose a further limitation. It seems to me quite proper that the Committee should have a chance to vote upon such an amendment. At the same time, I can fully understand the position taken up by the Treasurer. He is afraid that the further amendment moved by the honorable member for Parramatta will, since it is proposed by the honorable member for Coolgardie to exempt paper required for country newspapers, secure votes that it would not carry in other circumstances. </para>

                        <para>. - I am not going to submit quietly to this situation. I should be much obliged to the honorable member for Coolgardie if he would withdraw his amendment, and so save me from an awkward situation. It is not fair, perhaps, to ask him to do so, but, in the peculiar circumstances of the case - I think his amendment will be defeated - he might well accede to my request. He will have an  opportunity to again submit his amendment after a straight?-out vote on the item has been taken. </para>

                        <para>. - I think that the Treasurer is right. If vote be taken on the amendment moved by the honorable member for Parramatta, the Treasurer will undoubtedly be compelled to vote for a. principle that he has already repudiated. If the honorable member for Parramatta will give the matter a moment's reflection he will recognise that, having regard to the form in which the question would be put, the Treasurer, by opposing his amendment, would be voting quite contrary to the principle he has advocated. My proposal is for the imposition of a duty of jo per cent, on a portion of the item only. Such a vote would commit the Treasurer to a division of the item differentiating between two classes of newspapers. </para>

Am I to be submitted to a lot of abuse and then to be asked to accommodate these same honorable members ? The honorable member for Coolgardie, after asserting that I am responsible for the trouble that has occurred, wishes leave to withdraw his amendment, whilst the Treasurer for the last hour has been throwing out all sorts of insinuations. I know what is the matter. It is just as well that it should be publicly stated that the Treasurer fears that the feeling on the part of some of the members of the Labour party against the big daily newspapers will lead to the duty originally proposed by him being carried if they are kept together. That is at the bottom of the trouble. It is a sinister move on the part, not of the Opposition, but of honorable members opposite to get the old duty through when it is tied together. </para>

                            <para>- In that case I appeal to the Government, before a division is taken, to say something in defence of their proposals. . So much is due to those of us who are ranging ourselves with them, assuming that, as the duty has been proposed, there is some particular reason for it. A large number of members have voted for revenue and protective duties, and are now backing out, although the big newspaper  proprietors are as well able to pay a duty as are those upon whom they have been piling up taxation. As a matter of fact, even the Postmaster-General would faint if this duty were carried. However, reason or no reason, I shall support the Ministry on this occasion, though they cannot expect support on other items if they do not make a fight in this case. </para>

                        <para>.- As a matter of privilege, I wish to draw your attention, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> to the fact that this afternoon, at intervals, the privacy and silence of the room allotted to the Opposition has been disturbed by the playing of pianos. Pianos have been placed in one of the ante-chambers which we have been accustomed to use for the interviewing of our constituents and friends. Having been ousted from that apartment, we are now compelled to use the lobby for the purpose. I do not complain of that so much as I do of the fact that when one sits down to the study of the Tariff in the Opposition room, he is annoyed by the noise to which I refer. Honorable members should jealously guard their privileges, and especially those which are designed to facilitate the discharge of their functions within the precincts of this building. I ask you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> to take notice of this complaint, and get rid of the nuisance. Several honorable members have spoken to me about the matter. </para>

                        <para>.- I think that the amendment should be carried. Under the old Tariff the Customs authorities had great trouble in determining whether imported printing paper was to be used for the printing of newspapers or for other purposes. The best thing to do is to make all printing paper free. </para>

                        <para>.- We should know exactly what is covered by the amendment. It seems to me that, in accordance with their policy, the Government should be prepared to do something to encourage the local paper mills. I believe the proposed new paragraph would cover all kinds of paper, because there is hardly any limit to the variety of paper which is used for printing. The new magazine known as the <inline font-style="italic">Native Companion</inline> is, I understand, printed on paper made in Geelong. </para>

                            <para>- I could not say, though I am aware that the people connected with that magazine strongly advocate protection. In the case of the <inline font-style="italic">Native Companion,</inline> however, I am able to say that the editor, writers, and artists are all Australians, and the paper used is manufactured in Australia. I think the amendment should not be accepted. It is too much of a drag-net, since it would cover paper used for the printing of books, magazines, and job printing, as well as for the printing of newspapers. If we do not give some encouragement to the local manufacturers of paper we cannot expect any development of that industry, although, as we make greater progress in forestry, we shall probably grow timber from which pulp can be obtained for the manufacture of paper: The proposed new paragraph would cover every kind of paper except that specially mentioned in paragraph w - writing paper and paper for typewriting. I should like to hear the views of the Treasurer on the amendment. </para>

                        <para>. - I think the honorable member is quite right in asking these questions I believe the proposed paragraph would be found to be too much of a drag-net, and the honorable member has given excellent reasons why it should be opposed. We have paper mills, in which paper used for these purposes is at present being manufactured. I think the Committee has gone very far already in allowing printing paper to be admitted free. This is a serious matter for those who have established and are carrying on the manufacture of paper in the Commonwealth. I think the Committee should be prepared to give them encouragement and support. </para>

                        <para>.- I think the Government might just as well eliminate this paragraph. The quantity of this paper imported in 1906 amounted in value to only ^308. There is an anomaly in this division to which I should like to direct the attention of the Treasurer. It will be found that, although this paper is dutiable at 15 per cent., writing and typewriting paper identical with it is dutiable under paragraph (w) at only 5 per cent. Some of this paper is used for the printing of the better class of circulars. I- do not know how the Customs officials are to administer a Tariff of this kind. It seems to me that they would require to have an expert constantly at hand, and even then I should say there would be great difficulty in deciding what paper should be admitted at the lower duty and what at the higher duty. I suggest that the Treasurer should postpone this paragraph until we reach paragraph (w), and then deal with the papers contained in both at the same time. </para>

                            <para>- I suppose tha! it would give a considerable amount of work. I know the intention is to secure that the cutting of the paper shall be done here. The A section of the Tariff Commission recommended a duty of 15 per cent., which is the same as the duty under the- old Tariff, and that is also the duty proposed by the Government in this Tariff. There is, therefore, no alteration in this case. I admit that there is something in the contention of the honorable member for Coolgardie that the two kinds of paper should be on the same basis. </para>

                        <para>.- Tn the old Tariff these items were the same as they stand in this. It was provided that writing paper cut less than 16 x 13 inches, and paper (toilet) in rolls or packets, should be dutiable at 15 per cent., while writing and typing paper ' in sheets not less than 1.6 x 13 inches was free. These two provisions relating to writing paper are reproductions of the old Tariff, involving no alteration except in the latter case the 5 per cent, general Tariff. The reason for the discrimination is that it is thought desirable to encourage the importation of writing paper in bulk in order that the cutting up may be done here, so giving a considerable amount of labour in the Commonwealth. The one is comparatively the raw material. </para>

                    <para>My.  JOSEPH COOK. - That may be; but in connexion with some of these items, as to which there is practically no evidence, a little inquiry might have been made before the Commission recommended the old duty. If that had been done, it would have been found that this line gives very little employment. I understand that all that is necessary is a machine, and that practically no labour will be employed. One or two men and a machine doing nothing else but cutting the paper would cut up enough for the whole Commonwealth. One hesitates to interfere with old duties, but if ever there was a case made out for that interference it is this one. It does not give any employment, and is only another instance of many which we have already had under review, in which Ministers while pretending to impose duties in order to bring into being great national industries, are taxing the whole of the people of the Commonwealth for the purpose of trying to bring into operation a small incidental process. </para>

                        <para>. - I desire to impress again upon the Treasurer the necessity of putting paragraphs  e  and w together. There must be something wrong, because the importation last year of the paper under this paragraph amounted only to <inline font-style="italic">£308</inline> worth, and it is quite possible that a great quantity of it was imported free under the other description. Without saying anything at present about the rate of duty, I urge the Treasurer to put the two together, and also typing paper. There is no reason why a man who wants to type a letter should be able to buy cheaper paper than another who wants to write a letter. That is an absurd distinction. </para>

                    <para>Colonel FOXTON (Brisbane)  [8.18].-  One reason for not including carpet-felt paper in this item is that the papers already included, and those proposed to be added by the Minister, are largely the raw material of the paper-bag manufacturing industry. Carpet-felt paper, so far as I know, is. not the raw material of any industry. The carpet-felt paper is simply used as imported, whereas the papers which are included are closely related to those comprised in paragraph j. I call attention to the fact that the duty on paper bags is considerably lower than the duty on raw material ; and I should like to move that the duties be reduced to  3s. 6d.  and  3s.  as in the old Tariff. In order to preserve the paper-bag industry, which employs a much larger number of people than is employed in the making of the paper itself, it is necessary to leave a margin of at least  2s.  per cwt. in the duty. I have a letter here from a firm which is largely engaged in the manufacture of paper bags, and as it is short, and puts the case very clearly, I shall read it - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>So far as we are concerned, we have been working quite satisfactorily under the  old  Tariff of 3s. per cwt. duty on paper, and 5s. per cwt. on bags; and we think any addition to the duty unnecessary. There are, so far as we know, only two paper mills working in Australia, employing, on a liberal estimate, perhaps 100 hands. A fair price for paper, such as is used for sugar bags, which form  a  considerable portion of their output, is 7s. per cwt. f.o.b. London. The freight and charges, exclusive of duty, average about 4s. per cwt., so that, with the old duty of 3s. per cwt., the total charges amount to 7s., giving the local mills a protection of too per cent. If the duty is made 6s., as proposed, the protection will amount to 143 per cent. In the paper-bag business alone, there are a far larger number of hands employed than in the two paper mills. According to the proposed Tariff, our raw material, paper, is to have  its  duty doubled - though a large portion of it must be imported  in  any case - in order to give  an  unnecessarily high protection to the papermakers. That it is unnecessarily high  is  shown by the fact that  a  paper mill was run for  many  years  in  New South  Wales  without any protection. We hope, therefore, you will see your way to assist in having the duty on paper, Brown sugar (grey, blue and other tints) and Fruit Bag Paper," reduced to the old rate of 3s. per cwt. Far more serious to us than the increase in duty on paper is the alteration of the duty on paper bags. This was formerly 5s. per cwt., which allowed us a margin of 2s. per cwt. over the protection of 3s. on paper. This is now altered to 25 per cent, on English manufactured bags, and 30 pex cent, on foreign. What is the result? Grey and brown sugar bags, which form the larger proportion of our, and many other, manufacturers' output can be bought in London at from 8s. to 10s. per cwt, ; 50 that the duty on these will be reduced from 5s. per cwt. to 2s. to 2s. 6d. less than half, while the duty on paper, of which they are made, is to be doubled, viz., raised from 3s. to 6s. per cwt. The result of this will be to do away with the present protection both to the paper mills and the paper-bag makers; <inline font-style="italic">as,</inline> unless the mills reduce their present prices, which they say they cannot afford to do, it will pay the makers of such bags better to stop making and import, thus throwing a large number of hands out of employment. We should suggest that, as the present Tariff has worked satisfactorily, the duties on paper and bags should be as before, 3s. and 5s:  per cwt. respectively; but if this cannot be secured, at least the duty on bags should be at a fixed rate per cwt., as that on paper is, not <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem ;</inline> and that the same proportion should be maintained between the two as under : - </para>

                    <para>Colonel FOXTON. - I do not know what protection the duty gives to tEe maker of paper. My proposal would give continued employment to a large number in the bag-making industry, and would, I Imagine, though, personally, I do not know, give some protection, at all events, to the paper-making industry. From the point of view of the employment given, the paper-bag industry is much more important than the paper-making industry ; and it is necessary, therefore, that the former should have this modicum of protection.

                        <para>It is important to note in this connexion, that 6s. per cwt. on paper was the rate of the old Victorian Tariff previous to 1901, and that iri that Tariff the duty on- paper bags was 10s. per cwt., the same as we now suggest, in the event of the 6s. duty being retained on paper. </para>

                        <para>.- We ought to have more information to justify the doubling of the duty on the raw material of the paper-bag maker. I desire to see some protection given to the paper-making industry, but we have heard nothing to show that more than the old duty is necessary. It is very clear that if the duty be so excessive as to make importation the more advantageous, the industry will not be encouraged. We ought £0 have some information from the Treasurer to justify us in doubling the existing rate of duty. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member is not the Treasurer. To say that because the duty upon paper has been raised to 6s. per cwt. we must necessarily increase the rate upon bags to 10s. per cwt., is no answer to my question.  I should like to hear the honorable member for Bendigo, who was  Chairman  of the Tariff Commission, throw some light upon this subject. To me it does not appear that any reason has been assigned for increasing the duty upon paper from 3s. to 6s. per cwt. </para>

                        <para>. - I think that 6s. per cwt. is rather a high impost to levy upon this class of paper. If the first amendment be defeated I shall be prepared to move that the duty under the general Tariff be 5s. per cwt., and under the preferential Tariff 4s. 6d. per cwt. It is only right that all industries should receive a fair amount of protection. </para>

                        <para>.- I think that the duties proposed upon the paper enumerated in this paragraph are too high. In this connexion we have to consider the interests of the small shopkeepers. I know that in Victoria the industry of bag-making has been a remunerative one under the old rates. But confectioners have complained that they are unable to sell their goods at a reasonable profit on account of the increase in the duty upon bags. </para>

                            <para>- But the bags made from this class of paper weigh very heavy. By agreeing to the Government proposal we shall be placing upon the retailers a charge which they will not be able to pass on to their customers. Consequently it will fall very heavily upon the small men. I would further point out that very few paper-bags are imported. The total value of our imports under this heading is only about £3,000 annually. If we increase the duty upon bags to 4s. 6d. per cwt. under the general Tariff, and to 4s. per cwt. under the Tariff for the United Kingdom - an increase of 50 per cent. - I am sure that that will be sufficient. </para>

                        <para>. - I would point out that in 1906 we imported 4,542 tons of brown sugar paper of the value of £[65,920, and during the first six months of the present year we imported 2,419 tons, valued at .£34,853. It will thus be seen that we annually import nearly £70,000 worth, of this paper. That fact in itself - seeing that we have mills in every State of the Commonwealth capable of producing this particular paper - demonstrates that the existing duty is not sufficiently high. Of course, if we increase the duty upon paper it will be necessary to increase that upon bags. In New Zealand the duty upon brown sugar paper is 7s. 6d. per cwt., and that upon bags ns. 3d. per cwt. The Treasurer's proposals, therefore, are less than the New Zealand rates. In view "of the fact that this class of paper can be manufactured in every State, the Committee may very well assent to those proposals. </para>

                        (Corangamite) [8.41I.- The question of the duty upon paper-bags is one that seriously affects a large number of deserving persons throughout the Commonwealth. It affects shopkeepers, confectioners, grocers and others who have to give away these bags with the goods that they sell.

                            <para>- In many cases they do not. The honorable member for Melbourne Ports has argued in favour of absolute prohibition. Because paper-bags are imported he declares that we ought to raise the duty upon them to such a point as would exclude them. That is no argument for the advancement of the country. It is a positively ridiculous statement. We must permit a certain amount of competition, otherwise the industry, will be injured. Under the old rate of 3s. per cwt. this brown sugar paper has been manufactured in the Commonwealth. We have also been manufacturing the bags. As the honorable member for Brisbane has pointed out, there must be a considerable differentiation between the duty upon paper and that upon bags, because the former is the raw material of the bag-makers. Hitherto we have made the raw material of industries dutiable at 15 per cent. The Government, however, now propose a duty of 6s. 6d. per cwt. upon the raw material and duties of only 30 and 25 per cent, upon the finished product. </para>

He looked at his Tariff, noticed that the Commission had recommended a duty of only 25 per cent.., and accordingly remained silent upon the point. I noticed a twinkle in his eye as he observed the recommendation of 25 per cent., but he would not tell the honorable member for Darling that the A section of the Tariff Commission had recommended a duty of 6s. per cwt. on the raw material of the bag manufacturer, and that the duty on the finished bags should be reduced by one-half. </para>

                            <para>- I want to show the honorable gentleman where the anomalies are. Is it not an anomaly that the <inline font-style="italic">A</inline> section of the Tariff Commission should recommend that the duty on raw material should be increased by 100 per cent., and the duty on the finished bags decreased by 50 per cent. ? Obviously, it shows that they did not consider the relationship between the two items, and in the circumstances the Committee should pause before it accepts either recommendation. I think that the suggestion of the honorable member for Balaclava, that the duty should be fixed at 4s. 6d. and 4s. per cwt., is a. fair compromise, and if the Treasurer is not prepared to accept that he is very greedy. Surely he cannot expect us to double the duty on the bags? If we did so, it would do harm to a very large number of deserving persons. </para>

                            <para>- Item 156 in the New Zealand Tariff reads - " Paper bags, coarse, including sugar bags, 7s. 6d. per cwt." In New Zealand, as in Australia, the larger quantity of the imported bags is made of a paper which is not made locally, and also a' large proportion of the paper which is imported for bag-making is not made locally. So in item 156 of its Tariff New Zealand imposes a duty of 7s. 6d. per cwt. on " paper bags, coarse, including sugar bags," and in item 157 a duty of 5s. per cwt. on paper, that is, wrapping paper of all kinds ; while in , item 165 it levies a duty of 25 per cent, on !! paper bags n.o.e.," namely, all but the coarse paper bags, on which the duty of 7s. 6d. per cwt. is fixed. The Parliament of New Zealand recognised thai a large proportion of the paper which i? imported for the bags cannot be made within the Dominion. Nor can it be made in Australia. That largely accounts for our importations of a peculiar paper which, while light, is yet strong and tough. I agree with honorable members that the relationship of these duties is not fair to the manufacturer of bags; and although I am a free-trader I object more to a protection that protects the outside manufacturer than to a protection which protects the inside manufacturer. This duty is a protection to the outside manufacturer. Under a duty of  3s.  per cwt. the mills have been turning out a large quantity of these papers, and no reason has been given why the duty should be increased. I shall vote for the amendment foreshadowed by the honorable member for Brisbane, and try to get the duty on the paper brought as nearly as I can to the old rate. After that I shall vote proportionately as regards the duty on the paper bags. We ought to recognise, as in New Zealand, that it is only the coarser paper for bags which is made here, and that there is a certain quality which is not even made in America or Great Britain, but is imported largely to those countries for making bags. </para>

                        <para>. - I have received a copy of the circular which in October last was- addressed to the Minister of Trade and Customs by the South Australian Master Printers' and Allied Trades' Association. They point out that " white sulphide" and " krafft brown" papers, which are largely used in Australia, are not made locally. They also mention that sugar paper in grey blue and other tints costs about <inline font-style="italic">£9</inline> per ton in the-Old Country, suggest that a duty of  6s. 6d.  on the Home cost is unreasonable, and show that a duty of  3s.  per cwt. gives a protection of  33J  per cent, to the mills. They further state that the Australian mills make only a few grades of paper, and that there is a large quantity of paper which must be imported in the interests of the makers of paper bags. They submit that a duty of  3s.  per cwt. is ample in the case of fruit bags, sugar bags, or brown bags. They allege that the old duty gave ample protection. If the Committee impose a duty of  6s. 6d.  per cwt. on material which costs from <inline font-style="italic">j£&amp;</inline> to <inline font-style="italic">£9</inline> a ton, it will be prohibitive, and do considerable injury to the manufacturers of paper bags. On the other hand, if the Committee increase the duty on the bags it will penalize the users of them, especially so if the material cannot be made, or is not being made, in Australia. It will become a revenue duty, which must be passed on. The only sensible plan is to reduce the duty on the first item, and leave a fair margin to the bag-makers. </para>

                        <para>. - In  1901  the original duty imposed on this item was  6s.  per cwt In Victoria the duty was  6s.  ; in New Zealand it was  5s.,  and pretty well the same proportion was maintained in Canada and the United States. I intend to propose that the duty on brown paper be  5s.  in the general Tariff and  4s. 6d.  in the preferential Tariff, as suggested by the honorable member for Bass. And when we come to deal with bags, I intend to propose an addition of  2s.  per cwt. on each item, in order to give about the same protection  ;i»  is given in New Zealand. That will reduce the duty on each item to that which was intended or proposed. After listening to the debate, it seems to me that a proportion should be maintained. The duty of  6s. 6d.  per cwt. as proposed was, perhaps, a little too high.  <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dugald</inline> Thomson. - Fix the duties in the paragraph at  4s. 6d.  and  4s. </para>

                        <para>The proposed tax of 6s. 6d. per cwt. as against 3s. per cwt. in the old Tariff is a percentage that is altogether out of proportion to even the requirements of the manufacturers. On some papers it means a duty of 75 per cent. ; and is a prohibitive duty on an enormous quantity of bag-making paper that cannot possibly be made in the Commonwealth. It also tends to place the ordinary bag-maker absolutely' at the mercy of the paper merchant and the paper manufacturer; the latter especially (in lines that he can manufacture), is able to quote his made bags at a price which, when compared with his quotations to the bag-maker for. paper, leaves the latter no option but to go out of the business. Three shillings per cwt. should be an ample duty on these lines. No bag-making papers are imported from Great Britain. </para>

A little while ago they could not manufacture eucalyptus oil in the United States, but was that a reason why we should not make it in Australia? Because America cannot manufacture an article, is that a reason why Australia cannot? I know that these goods are made in Geelong, and I believe that they are- also made in Sydney. The South Australian printers, whose opinion has been quoted by the honorable member for Grey, are blind to what is being done in Australia. ' We do not find the Victorian Printers' Association, who live on the spot where the goods ar« manufactured, saying that they cannot be made here.

                            <para>- If the duties do not affect the printers, why was such an appeal made by the honorable member for Grey on behalf of the South Australian printers, who are asking that the duties shall be reduced? The honorable member for North Sydney has said that we should not protect outsiders. I agree with him. I urge the Government to allow the duty to remain as it stands, and to increase the duty on bags to about double what is at present proposed. I wish to appeal to those who are in favour of good wages being paid, and short hours of labour worked, to support these duties. We. have lately had an example of the good effects of the new protection, which honorable members opposite seem glad to talk about without doing much to promote when they have an opportunity. In consequence of the imposition of these duties the mills of Geelong have been .able to reduce the hours of labour from sixty per week to forty-eight without a reduction of the wages of the workmen, and I am glad to be able to publicly state that the directors have promised me that that shall be a permanent reduction of hours. </para>

It existed under the Tariff proposed by the Government to which the right honorable member belonged. The duty was so low that it was impossible to reduce the hours of labour.

                        <para>- In Sydney there is a large' paper mill in Moore-street, at which blues, greys, and wrapping paper are very largely made. .A witness, representing the mill, appeared before the Commission, and informed us that it was an established fact that, notwithstanding the duty of  ^3  per ton on wrapping paper, it could be landed in Sydney from Germany, Sweden, and other foreign countries at about <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> per ton cheaper than the cost existing prior to the formation of the present Tariff. The witness consequently claimed consideration against this fierce competition. He particularly drew attention, to the fact that this printing paper, which we have made free, and which is made free under the character and in the name of printing paper, is often brought into use as wrapping paper. I should like the Minister to consult his officers about this question, and to see whether some strict definition of. printing paper cannot be introduced into the Tariff. I think that it is possible to provide that free printing paper should not be allowed to be used as paper for wrapping purposes. I also think that the manufacturers should receive consideration for their wrapping paper. In the meantime, I am disposed to think, on re-perusing the evidence, that  6s.  per cwt. for these papers is too high. I am disposed to accept .the Minister's suggestion, and to bring it down a little. </para>

                        <para>. - The evidence just read by the honorable member for Bendigo supports my proposition. It shows that the imported paper can be sold at <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> per ton less than the price of the locally-manufactured paper. The increased duty which I propose, namely,  5s.  per cwt., instead of  3s.  per cwt. in 'the case of general imports, will make good that difference. </para>

                        <para>. - It is complained by some makers of envelopes that this is another case in which the duty on the raw material has been increased to the detriment of the manufactured article. They assert that the duty on envelopes is not more than the duty on cartridge paper, which is largely used in their manufacture. I do not know to what extent cartridge paper is. made here. Can the Treasurer explain the reason for the increase? </para>

                        <para>.- Both blotting and cartridge papers are made here; but some of those in the trade have suggested that there should, be an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty of 20 per cent, on cartridge paper and a fixed duty on blotting paper. I am not sufficiently acquainted with the subject to know what is best to be done, but I should like the Treasurer to consider the matter. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. Although I do not wish to occupy the time of the Committee unduly, I am in a position to show that the local manufacturer of strawboard, notwithstanding his promise to the Tariff Commission not to increase the price of that article if the duty were increased, has increased it to an amount equivalent to the increase in the duty; that he either cannot or will not supply the local demands; that he has a monopoly ; and that there are very few hands employed in the manufacture of strawboard, the article being made almost entirely by machinery. In short, I can make out a good case for the reduction for which I ask. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. One of the largest makers of cardboard boxes, of which strawboard is the raw material, is established in my electorate. The old duty of  is.  per cwt. was equivalent to an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rate of  25  per cent, while the proposed duty of  2s. 6d.  per cwt. is equivalent to  62J  per cent. But under the old rate the local manufacturer was able to increase his output; and that he had a large margin of profit' is shown by the fact that, when the Tariff Commission were taking evidence, he was selling strawboard in Sydney at the price at which he sold it in Melbourne, notwithstanding freight charges amounting to  16s.  per ton,, and other charges bringing up the total to <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> per ton. If the Treasurer will meet me in this matter, I shall be glad. I make the request as one who has given him a good deal of support in connexion with the Tariff. </para>

Members of the Opposition have declared that, in order to prevent undue discussion, and to enable us to return to our homes by Christmas, they would accept what they termed a fair thing; and now I, who have given the Government support, ask that in a matter in which I am very much concerned the Treasurer will grant a request for a reduction. If he will meet me in this matter, I shall sit down, but, if not, I shall be compelled to show the Committee what a strong case there is for reducing the proposed rates. </para>

                        <para>. - Even from the point of view of the local manufacturer of strawboard, there can be no justification for the duties proposed by the Government. We were told when the old duty of is. per cwt. was agreed to that it would have the effect of closing the factory ; but, as a matter of fact, the business has developed and extended so as to give no logical or sufficient reason for even a small increase in the duty. The Treasurer has intimated that he is willing to agree, to a duty  50  per cent, higher than the old rate; but I do not think that we should accept that offer. It must be remembered that, while only a comparatively small number of hands are employed in the one mill which makes strawboard here, many hundreds are employed in the factories which use it. The preference to Great Britain is a mere pretence, . and the Minister is prepared to abolish it, knowing as he does that, practically, strawboard is not made in the United Kingdom. The old rate of duty was equivalent to 25 per cent, on unlined strawboard, to 20 per cent, on "strawboard lined on one side, and to 15 per cent, on strawboard lined on both sides. That information is given in answer to question 93,689 of the Tariff Commission's evidence. It is true that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDougall,</inline> the manufacturer, said that in some instances the duty was equivalent to only 12J per cent., but he can have referred only to strawboard lined on both sides with glazed paper. The duty of is. 6d. at present proposed is an Increase- of 50 per cent, on the old Tariff, and will make the figures 37 J per cent, on unlined strawboard, 30 per cent, oh strawboard lined on one side, and 22J per cent, on strawboard lined on both sides. That must have a serious effect on the users of this material. It represents' a very considerable increase on a line which is the raw material of an industry which must supply its manufactures at a cheap rate if they are to be used at all. They are used as a substitute for paper wrapping, and they will not be used unless they are sold at a rate which will bring them within measurable distance of the price of paper. The Broadford mills, which are the only mills manufacturing strawboard, are in the hands of a combination consisting of two companies who pooled their assets, and who have a monopoly. I allude to that not as an attack upon them, but in order to show that the company has every opportunity to take full advantage of any" duty that may be imposed. I do not object to a monopoly properly conducted, but I object to passing a duty for the benefit of a monopoly, which, because it has no competition to contend with, is able to take full advantage of that duty, when ho good reason can be shown for its imposition, and when it is clear it will injure another industry. Those interested in the Broadford mills form part of a paper mill combine. I am assured that they have formed a combine, can fix their own prices, and in that way also take every advantage of any duty imposed. I understand that sales of their papers, not strawboard, in Queensland" and New South Wales are allotted to one company, and sales in Victoria anc? South Australia to another, and they have agreed as to the prices they shall give for their raw material. There might be no objection to such an arrangement if it were reasonably conducted, and without State assistance, but when we are asked to give this industry assistance by means of the Tariff we have a right to ask whether it is needed, and whether it will be good for other industries. The' statements I have made will be found to be borne out by the evidence submitted by the Tariff Commission. Freight and charges on the imported article amount to over 50 per cent. That in itself is surely a large protection, and yet we are asked to give from 22I per cent, to 37J per cent. more. In this case we have not to ask whether the price will be raised as the result of the imposition of the duty, because the price has already been raised by 30s. a ton, and advantage has therefore already been taken of the increased duty. It is true that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDougall,</inline> for the company, said that if some of the duties on the raw materials of the industry were reduced they would hot raise their price. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, it was pointed out to him that it was a dangerous promise to make, because the price of his raw material might go up, and he said he would take that risk and give the promise. The promise has not been fulfilled. There has been no increase in the duties upon the raw materials of the industry which would justify the increase in the price of strawboard, whilst the duty has been taken off dextrine and has been lowered in the case of other materials. The effect of the proposed duty is shown in this way. I have here a carton for a candle-maker which would be dutiable at 30 per cent, and 25 per cent. </para>

                            <para>- That is so, and it would be dutiable at 30 per cent, in the General Tariff and 25 per cent, if imported from the United Kingdom. I do not remember the wording of the alteration the Treasurer has made in paragraph g, but it would not affect such packets as this carton, which would come under item  353A.  Now, what has the carton-maker to pay? On the strawboard alone he would have to pay, according to the duty proposed by the Government, 37 J per cent. </para>

                            <para>- No. The percentage of duty would be from 621 per cent, to 37$ per cent., at the 2s. 6d. and 2s. rates. But taking the duty at is. fid. a cwt., as I have shown, the percentages of duty would be 37 J per cent., 30 per cent and 22 J per cent, for strawboard unlined, lined on one side, and lined on both sides respectively, so that the maker of the carton would actually pay more on unlined strawboard imported for its manufacture than the duty charged on the unlined strawboard made up in the form of the carton I produce. That is a serious matter for those engaged in the business, and yet that would be the condition of affairs, brought, about by the proposal now made. I think the Minister will see that we should not impose a duty in excess of that imposed under the old Tariff. Under the operation of that Tariff the single factory has expanded, and presumably there was reason for it in the results achieved. I could say a great deal more about this, but I do not wish to delay the Committee. I trust the Minister will reduce his demand to the rare of the old duty. No reason has been shown for increasing, whilst good reason has been shown for retaining it. </para>

                        <para>.- If there is one thing which more than another should induce the Committee to revert to the old ' duty on this item, it is the action which has been taken by the local manufacturer of strawboard. When this gentleman was before the Tariff Commission he was emphatic in his assertion that if he could get an increased duty there would be no increase in the price of locally-made strawboard. </para>

                            <para>- He was cross-questioned, and it was suggested that that was a rash promise to make. Still he was positive, and said that if he were given an increased duty he would be prepared to enter into a guarantee that he would not increase the price of strawboard. As a matter of fact, he has increased his price twice since he gave that promise. The first increase was by 10s. per ton, and immediately after this Tariff was tabled he increased his price by another- 20s. The Government propose to fix the duty at is. 6d. per cwt. The old duty represented 25 per cent, on the cost price, and the natural protection 60 per cent, so that under the old duty of is. per cwt. the local manufacturer enjoyed a protection of 85 per cent. </para>

This industry does not employ one-tenth of the number pf persons employed in the making up of boxes, vet the larger number of employes is to be penalized for the benefit of this firm established near Melbourne. I had a very interesting telegram sent to me to-day, and I believe a copy of it was sent to every member of the Committee. </para>

                            <para>- Then the telegram is altogether misleading. According to the evidence there are only about twenty hands employed in the industry. Surely a protection of 85 per cent, under the old Tariff is enough. If we are to consider the number of employes, we ought to give greater weight to the claims of the boxmakers, who employ a much larger number of hands than the strawboard-makers do. It looks as if we were to starve a big in- ' dustry in order to keep a little local combine going. This firm have had orders on hand for months past, and are unable to execute them. Yet they want a higher duty. There is not a duty proposed in this Tariff that is less warranted, and the Minister knows it. If a duty which, plus the natural protection, amounts to 85 per cent., is not sufficient, then, in all conscience, the industry ought to go under. If it is a question of whether that or the box-making industry, which employs between 3,000 and 4,000 hands, is to go under, then the strawboard-making industry ought to go under. There are ten times as many hands employed in making boxes in South Australia, which is only a part of the Commonwealth, as there are in that industry. We ought also to consider those who use the boxes. The duty has already put the price of the boxes up by from 15 to 20 per cent. What is there about this particular firm, who were so positive when before the Royal Commission that they would not 'increase their price, that this Committee should give them all they ask for, especially in view of the fact that they have increased their prices twice since they made that statement? Their price now has exactly absorbed the whole advantage of the increased duty. Where it was £7 ios., it is now £9. If we were to put on another 50 per cent, duty they would increase their prices proportionately. They knocked out all the other small makers, and it is not the function of this Committee to bolster up combines  of that kind, which have no concern about any other business' man. This firm would crush any other firm if it got a chance. It has done so already. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member is just about as correct in that allegation as he was when he asserted positively that I was wrong in saying that discs were not made in Australia. He was satisfied that they were made in his own district, but he afterwards found that they were not made in Australia at all. I was not here when the kerosene item was passed, so how can the honorable member say that I was standing up for the Standard Oil Company ? </para>

                            <para>- Of course ! I go for cheap kerosene, as the honorable member did a few years ago, when we put it on the free list. This strawboard-making firm has increased its prices in face of its own sworn evidence, and the only excuse it gives is that the cost of its raw material has been increased. I defy the members of the firm to point to an increase of more than 3s. 6d. in the value of a ton of their raw material since this Tariff was introduced. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not think that we should be concerned about any foolish statement that a representative of any firm made to the Tariff Commission. If we are to deal with big industries on that basis we shall get very much astray. It was a foolish thing for a man to say, and a foolish thing to ask anybody. If is only fair to state that one of the reasons given since then for the increase of price is the immense rise in the price of- straw, which is the absolute raw material. </para>

                            <para>- The firm gave me that as one of the principal reasons. "We are not here to base our consideration of proposed duties upon statements made by individuals. We should dismiss them altogether. A statement of that kind did not bind the company if they did not wish to keep to it. Nor have we been, so far, in this Tariff, legislating out of consideration for the numbers of persons employed in particular industries. It is said that there is only one factory concerned in this case ; but' it is reasonable to assume that if there were large profits in the industry a number of other strawboard factories would have been started in the Commonwealth, because the raw material is obtainable anywhere. There have been other cases where there was only one concern in an industry, but some of us appealed in vain to the Committee for consideration of the much greater number of other people who would be affected. I therefore take it that we might dismiss the argument about the statement which was made and not kept, and a? to which they possibly have an answer, and also the fact that there are not a very large number of hands employed in the industry. What we have to consider* is what is a fair amount of protection to give to the industry, so that it may be carried on at a reasonable profit and in such a way that there may be a fair chance of encouraging competition. I think the 2s. 6d. proposed by the Government is too high. At the same time we have to consider the strawboard makers. </para>

                            <para>- That would be a fair compromise. I am informed that prior to the last Tariff the condition of the industry was such that the men in this factory offered voluntarily to work for twelve hours a day in order to keep the thing going. That helped their -employers through, and when the last' Tariff was adopted the employers gave them a forty-eight hours' week without any reduction of wages. I believe those are the facts. </para>

                            <para>- It only proves that previously without the duty they were unable to carry on. It does not prove that when the duty was imposed in the last Tariff the employers made big profits. We have no evidence as to how much profit they have made, but I take it that there cannot be  a  great deal in the industry, or there would have been other competitors. There could not be a monopoly in an industry with the raw material so plentiful in every State, but the fact is that there has not been enough in it to induce others to take it up. We have also to consider the box-makers, for I am sure that the 2s. 6d. duty first proposed would have been too heavy a burden upon them; but the Committee might fairly accept a duty of is. 6d., and give the strawboard industry the same encouragement as we are giving the other industries. </para>

                        <para>.- The Broadford factory is in my electorate. . I know something about it, and it is only due to the proprietors that I should state a few facts. The number of employes in the factory is seventy-five, so that it is not a small concern. In addition to those directly engaged in the factory, a large number of people are employed in carting wood and .straw, and the company buy straw, from the farmers. The product is entirely the -result of labour at every point. The honorable member for Lang stated that the firm had recently imported 500 tons of strawboard from. Germany, with which to supply their orders. I am assured that that is absolutely incorrect. </para>

                            <para>- We had reasons for importing strawboard, of which we are large consumers. I am assured by the honorable member for Riverina, who has just inquired, that at no time has strawboard been imported for the Broadford Mills. I merely give the information as it is given to me by people who are in a position to know that the statement made here to-night is not correct ; and I may say, further, that it is not true that the Broadford Mills cannot execute orders. After the last Tariff was settled, the question was whether, under the low duty, the Broadford Mills could be carried on; and I am informed that the employes agreed to work longer hours in order to tide over the trouble, and that no dividend was paid by the company for several years. I have no personal knowledge of these facts, but give them as they have been related to me. </para>

                            <para>- I think it is dear just now, though I do not know. I am assured, however, that the supplies are ample for present requirements. There  aTe,  of course; certain kinds of strawboard, which are not produced at the Broadford Mills, and which must be imported whatever duty be imposed. It is only fair that the case for the other side should be laid before honorable members, in view of the many incorrect statements that have been made. I visited the Broadford Mills some time ago, and found that they were largely the support of the town. The employes, who, of' course, reside there with their families, were ready to help their employers in difficult circumstances ; but I hear to-night that since the imposition of the new duty the hours have been made forty-eight instead of sixty per week, the latter being the number which the men volunteered to work in the time of trouble. </para>

                        <para>. - The question of strawboard is like ' ' King Charles' head ' '-it is always cropping up. This is the third time this session that we have had a discussion relating to this particular commodity. Whether this is because those interested hope to ultimately arrive at what is substantially prohibition, I do not know; but so sure as any interference with the Tariff is proposed, up comes the question of strawboard. On the two previous occasions, the discussions resulted in the maintenance of the duty of is., which has always been regarded as fair in the case of an article which ought certainly to be easy of manufacture in a place like Australia, where there is plenty of the raw material available at a very cheap rate. Honorable members talk about the price of straw having gone up lately ; but I venture to say that it has not gone up to anything like the extent to which it has in the older countries of the world. I have been wondering why the Government have reintroduced this question. On the last occasion, the then Treasurer himself gave the best of all reasons why the proposed duty should not be imposed, and eventually withdrew it on his own motion. It may be, however, that a new Treasurer has promised that the increased duty would be proposed. Reference has been made by the honorable member for Mernda to the fact that the Broadford mill has not been doing particularly well. Can we wonder at that when protectionists of the bright, particular star-colour of the honorable member sends to the United Kingdom for his strawboard? </para>

                            <para>- I am particularly anxious to hear why the honorable member sent to England for strawboard, and I fancy the reason, if the matter were probed to the bottom, is that he found the imported strawboard to suit his purpose better than the local strawboard. That, of course, is always a legitimate reason for preferring one strawboard. to another. I have heard that there is great difference in the quality of strawboard, and that for some purposes it is still necessary to import. I presume the honorable member for Mernda had in his mind the smaller sorts of boxes which require a particular kind of strawboard that can be turned and twisted into shape. I believe that some strawboard is very brittle, and, when made into small shapes, has a tendency to break. However, it does occur to me that, with straw as cheap as it is in Australia, and considering what, I presume, is the simple process of manufacture, we ought to be able, in view of the natural protection which our isolation affords, to make strawboard equal, at least, to any that can be procured from abroad. This matter was investigated by the Tariff Commission, and I presume that the evidence by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDougall</inline> was well weighed. Why the  Chairman  of the Tariff Commission should recommend this increase of duty I do not know? I am informed that the  chairman  of this company, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDougall,</inline> told the Tariff Commission that the old rate was equivalent to 12 J per cent. If that be so, I am prepared to vote for a duty of 25 per cent, upon this article. </para>

                        <para>.- I am glad that this question is being discussed by honorable members without heat. There are one or two matters connected with it that we ought to take into consideration. I can easily understand that it was quite possible for a witness before the Tariff Commission,' without looking ahead, to promise that the price of strawboard would not be increased. But when the cost of the raw material is increased it is necessary that the duty upon the finished article should also be increased. </para>

                            <para>- I do not deny that fact. I am merely pointing out that it is reasonable to suppose that the duty upon the finished article should be increased in proportion to the increase in the cost of the raw material. The honorable member for Grey spoke of the natural protection. which this industry enjoys. But I have been informed upon the most reliable authority that instead of the freight upon strawboard being <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> or ^3 per ton it has been brought from Holland for 5s. and even 2s. 6d. per ton. </para>

Here is a certificate given by the employes of this firm, who, sooner than see an infant industry crushed out of existence, volunteered to continue to work at a smaller wage. </para>

All these factors should induce honorable members to stand by an industry which if assisted will be considerably enlarged and will deprive no one of any work. </para>

                        <para>.- During the consideration of the Tariff we have had many examples of protected industries which have been established asking for an increased duty. Here is another instance of that kind. In the beginning a duty was asked for to establish the industry until it had attained sufficient strength to stand without it. </para>

                            <para>- No. What happens in all these cases? In the beginning a duty is asked for and obtained under false pretences. Certain persons come to the Legislature and say, " If you will only give us a certain duty " - and they generally ask for a small duty to start - "we shall be able to establish the industry, and once we are firmly established we shall not want a duty." But no sooner do they get the duty and start the industry than they come cap in hand for more power to dip their hands into the public Treasury to increase their profits. Here we are confronted with another example of that kind of conduct. Oliver Twist was not in it with these people. There was every excuse for the poor unfortunate hero of Dickens, but there is no excuse for these well-fed, pampered manufacturers, who are centred chiefly in and around Melbourne. Even if they should get a protection of 2s.6d. per cwt. on this occasion, next time they will want a protection of 5s., and so the eternal cry for "more" will go on. That is the kind of greed which feeds upon itself. The more protection they receive the more they want; when they get hoary-headed with age they will be still crying out for more protection. </para>

It is all very well for the honorable member for Mernda to plead on behalf of this industry. He is understood to be a protectionist from principle.

                            <para>- Yes; but it must be remembered that both statements come from sources which are interested in the industry, though perhaps from opposite stand-points. It will rest with the Committee to determine which statement is right. I am not prepared to vouch for the accuracy of the statement I cited, but I am prepared to vouch for the character of the person from whom I obtained my information. Strawboard is not manufacture'd in England. . As a matter of fact, there is a clause in the leases of most English farmers requiring them to return all the straw to the soil for manuring purposes. It is stated in a journal published in the interests of the boxmakers and strawboard manufacturers that practically all the strawboard manufactured in Holland is exported to Great Britain. </para>

Reference has been made to the number of telegrams sent to honorable members with the object of influencing their votes on this question. It is a strange thing that these telegrams should have been sent simultaneously. I wonder who paid for them. Does any one really believe that the employes sent them at their own expense? I am sure that they have not money to spare for sending so many telegrams to honorable members. Now in his evidence before the Tariff Commission, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. James</inline> McDougall was questioned with regard to prices. He told the Commission that if the duty was increased the prices of strawboard would not be raised. I will quote from his evidence - questions 80,787 to 80,789 - </para>

                            <para>- There is no other local firm which makes strawboard. The increase referred to is, I understand, in the locally-manufactured article. The circular speaks for itself. In face of this evidence, I hope that honorable members will pause before they consent to an increase in the duty. They must remember that strawboard is the raw material of a very large number of industries employing many hands - many more than those employed in the strawboard industry itself.- Are not these people to have any consideration? Are not the people who use strawboard boxes for the purpose of enclosing their wares not to have consideration either? Is the consumer always to pay the piper, and grin and bear it? He is the one individual in the community whose interests do not seem to enter into the consideration df protectionists for a single moment. There is only one other point to which I wish to refer, and that is the case of those who have to import strawboard for the purpose of manufacturing the finer kind of boxes. I am- credibly informed by those in the trade that the locally-made strawboard, although it is useful, cannot be used for all purposes. It is not useful for the manufacture of the better class of boxes which are required for the more delicate articles of manufacture. We have therefore to consider first that the local strawboard, although it is improving in quality,, is not equal to the imported article, and secondly that the works of the manufacturers of the local strawboard are not sufficiently large to supply all the requirements of the Commonwealth. The suggestion of the honorable member for Parramatta for an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty, even as high as 25 per cent., as preferable to the fixed duty of is. 6d., or even is., is one that should commend itself even to high Tariff protectionists in the Committee. </para>

                    <para class="block">That disposes of the statement of the honorable member for Mernda that this is a manual labour industry. The honorable member for Lang has quoted from the evidence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDougall,</inline> showing that he undertook, after due consideration, not to raise the price of strawboard if the duty were increased. The honorable member for Darling urges that we ought not to pay much consideration to such statements. But <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDougall</inline> is not the man to speak lightly of such things. He is not the man to make a promise of that kind without consideration. He knew what he was talking about when he gave that promise. One is almost forced to the conclusion that he made it with the reservation that he would break it as soon as he got an opportunity.  His  explanation of the increase in the price will not, to my mind, hold water.

                        <para>In reply to this, we question the justness of raising the prices while the Tariff is under consideration, but totally disagree with him in his reasons for so doing, based as they are on the heavy duties imposed on felts, wires, lining paper, and dextrine. In the first item, "felts" - even if used in a strawboard-making machine - would, come in free under division XVI. (Miscellaneous). Item  441  reads - " Felts foi paper-making machine, free." Next, "wires" is dealt with under division VI. (Metals and Machinery), item 225, General, 5 per cent., British, free. As the British-made wire is better quality and as cheap as any other make, this item can be reckoned free also. Lining paper and dextrine - As neither of these is used at all on un-lined boards, no extra duty on them need be considered. </para>

                    <para>In this letter Messrs. Fuerth and Nail, who are paper-box manufacturers in Sydney, show that every one of the reasons given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDougall</inline> for raising prices is without foundation. Even if these raw materials were not free <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDougall</inline> could not be released from the promise that he made when before the Tariff Commission that he would not, under any circumstances, increase the price of strawboard. The only other point with which  1  desire to deal is that relating to the natural protection enjoyed by the local manufacturers. It is true that for a short time a few consignments of strawboard came in - while the freight war lasted - at  5s.  per ton. A special shipment was brought in at that rate when the ship-owners were cutting freights, but those circumstances do not pertain to-day, and are not likely to recur. The <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin,</inline> in writing in opposition to Messrs. Fuerth and Nail's contention, in its issue of  12th  September last, acknowledged that it was only while the freight war lasted that this rate was charged. </para>

                            <para>- It will be interesting to place on record a comparison of charges on Dutch and Australian strawboard. The expenses on one ton of Dutch strawboard are as follow: - Freight from Holland to Hamburg,10s. ; Hamburg dues and agency f . o.b.,  7s. 6d.  ; freight from Hamburg to Sydney by sailer,  18s.9d.  ; insurance,  3s. 7d.  ; exchange,  5s.  ; agent's commission,5 per cent. on c.i.f.,  5s. <inline font-style="italic">5d. ;</inline> wharfage,  3s.9d.  ; cartage,  3s.  ; duty under old Tariff, <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> ; total, <inline font-style="italic">£3</inline> 17s.  The expenses on one ton of Broadford strawboard are as follow :  - Expenses from mill, Broadford, to f.o.b. Melbourne,  12s. 6d. ;  freight, Melbourne to Sydney, at  12s. <inline font-style="italic">6d.,</inline> less  10  per cent.,11s.  3d.  ; insurance,  8d. ;  wharfage,  3s.9d.  - these are the actual charges - cartage,  3s.  ; leaving a balance of £2.  5s.10d.,  which is equal to an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty of  513/4  per cent. f.o.b. in favour of the Broadford mill. The strawboard mill gives employment to twenty or thirty hands, whereas the industries that seeks a reduction of the duty give employment to between  3,000  and  4,000. </para>

                            <para>- I do not say that the Treasurer has been guilty of sharp practice; but to an outsider it might seem that he has worked a point on the Opposition in getting honorable members to agree to certain rates on raw material on the promise that he would propose lower rates on the finished article, and failing to carry out that promise. I do not deny that he may have been asked to make this alteration ; but, having made a bargain, he should have stuck to it. Of course, it is no use talking, but I enter my protest against what has been done. . </para>

                        (Brisbane) [11.12]. - There may be some misapprehension on the part of the honorable member for Lang in regard to what the Treasurer has done. The rates originally proposed in connexion with bag paper were 6s. 6d. and 6s. per cwt. ; and when I suggested their reduction to 3s. 6d. and 3s.., the Treasurer intimated that he was prepared to increase the duty on bags to 11s. and 10s. to preserve the proportion. On the reduction of the duty on paper the Treasurer proposed to make the duty on bags 7s. 6d. and 7s. In regarding those as fair rates on bags, he was evidently misled by the fact that the difference between the two sets of duties remained the same, forgetting that the proportion was different. Under the circumstances, he was justified in moving for rates of 8s. and 7s. 6d., which preserve as nearly as possible the old proportion. If the paper-bag industry is to be preserved, the margin given will be little enough.

                        <para>.- When the old Tariff was being discussed six years ago, I had a letter similar to the one I have in hand now from the Bookbinders and Paper-rulers' Union, which at that time was a Victorian institution, but has since become a federated union, making the same suggestion as' that which has been made by the honorable member for Cook, with the exception that cardboard and pasteboard should also be admitted free. These articles are the raw materials of the book-binding industry, and as books when made up are admitted free it is not right to penalize the local book-binding industry by levying any duty at all upon cardboard or pasteboard. These articles are not made here. </para>

                        <para>.- I think I have a prior amendment to that moved by the honorable member for Cook, because I wish to have cardboard and pasteboard left out. I have here a photographic mount' which is manufactured in Australia, but the whole of the middle of the mount is manufactured from what is called " wood-pulp middles," a material which is not manufactured and cannot be manufactured in Australia, and which is useless for any other purpose than the manufacture of these mounts. </para>

                            <para>- The  Chairman  of the Tariff Commission has been inquiring into the matter for two years, and I am prepared to accept his opinion. The Government, when they have found themselves in trouble, have been keen enough to shelter themselves behind the decisions of the Tariff Commission. I do not think' we should leave the articles about which some doubt has been expressed to be struck out of this item when the Tariff is before another place. I prefer that the honorable member for Cook should add to his amendment " pasteboard and cardboard." </para>

                        <para>.- I suggest that Manila board should also be included. This board is made from grey board, with an outside of wood board, and is used for purposes similar to those for which the boards proposed by the Treasurer are used. I am afraid that unless it is included it may fall under some other paragraph. </para>

                        <para>.- There is no advantage in the preference that is proposed. For instance, wood pulp middles are not brought from the Old Country, and those interested in the paper mills  admit that the article ought to come in free. I have here a statement from the manufacturers as follows - </para>

                        <para>The middles are a rough paper, forming the body of the cardboard, and they are made from spruce and some other soft woods, which in Canada and Sweden and some other countries where water-power is plentiful are ground up into a kind of pulp, and in the one process made into middles, such as we use. There is no wood grown in Australia in any marketable quantity which could be used for this purpose, nor is water-power available. </para>
                        <para>No witness on behalf of the local paper mills or, as far as we know, on behalf of any Australian paper mill, made any request that, these wood pulp middles should be made to pay duty. They do not compete against any article produced in Australia, or likely to be  produced, as they are far too expensive to compete against strawboard, and the thickness to be admitted free might be limited to an equivalent of 140 lbs. per ream royal, and under. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>It will be seen from this that wood pulp middles are not made in the United Kingdom, and that, therefore, the proposed preference is a sham. The Treasurer wishes the Committee to believe that by admitting these articles free under the Tariff for the United Kingdom he is giving a substantial preference to the Mother Country. But, as a matter of fact, he is doing nothing of the kind. I move - </para>

                        <para>. - The object of my proposal has already been stated by the honorable member. But I should like to hear an explanation from the honorable member for Bendigo, in regard to the recommendation of the Commission upon this item, which to me appears to be an extraordinary one. The A section of the Commission has recommended that it should be dutiable at 20 per cent., and the B section that it should bear a 10 per cent. duty. But the Department is absolutely opposed to either of the duties suggested, and I should like to know whether a mistake has not occurred. The duty proposed has been adopted' on the recommendation of the A section of the Commission. . " </para>

Referring to surface coated paper being free, he pointed out that the printing paper of which it is composed was also free; but that as regards the materials used for surface coating the paper, there was a duty of 2s. per cwt. on pulp colours ; 2s. per cwt. on blanc fixe; 2s. per cwt. on satin white; and 20 per cent, on albumen glue.

That is the reason why the A section of the Tariff Commission recommended that there should be a duty of 20 per cent. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDougall</inline> made a very strong appeal, and we thought that he had made a very strong case for surface coated paper to be protected - not to the same extent, perhaps, as the strawboard, but still to some extent, considering that he was taxed on his raw material. </para>

                        <para>. - I suppose that this duty will become one of the slaughtered innocents, as the Treasurer has, unfortunately, agreed to make the article free. This commodity has been manufactured in Australia for some time. Surely we can believe the manufacturers when they tell us that they can make surface coated paper. I am sure that it can be made here, and made well too. A duty on the finished article is essential, because the majority of the raw materials are liable to duty. But as I understand that the Treasurer has another proposition- to make in connexion with this matter I shall resume my seat. </para>

I presume that the trade is not yet in a position to supply the endless varieties which are required. </para>

                        <para>. - I desire to elicit from the Treasurer how he proposes to deal with paragraph  r,  which subjects paper shavings and waste paper for paper making to a duty of 5 per cent., except when imported from the United Kingdom, whence they are admitted free. I also desire to know how he intends to deal with paragraph  t,  under which pulp for manufacturing paper is dutiable at 5 per cent., except when it is imported from the United Kingdom, whence it comes in free. It seems to me that if surface coated paper is to be made free, the articles embraced in paragraphs  r  and  t  should be dealt with in the same way.- I presume t'hat if the United Kingdom is incapable of supplying the finished article it will not have much of the raw material to supply to the Commonwealth. Apparently, the Treasurer does not intend to reply to my inquiries on these heads. But there is another question on which, perhaps, he may be able to give me some information. I understand that certain weekly newspapers use a- surface coated paper, which of course is superior to the news paper that has been made free. I desire to ascertain from the honorable gentleman what paper in the past has been imported under the designation of surface coated paper. </para>

                        <para>. - I understand that the papers dealt with in this_ paragraph are to be made free with the proviso that coated boards shall be dutiable. Surface paper is undoubtedly produced in the Commonwealth. But the manufacturers of it will be prepared, if they receive a sufficient protection on coated boards, to forego a duty on this particular class of paper. </para>

                        <para>.The position, as I understand it, is this : Under paragraph  k  we have imposed duties on the raw material of 20 per cent, and 15 per cent. Now it is proposed to give a margin of 5 per cent, for the surface coating of boards. I am given to understand that that is not nearly enough. A margin of 15 per cent, is asked for. I have here a letter on the subject. Honorable members have been inundated with letters. I almost wish that we could impose a heavy duty on letters to members of Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- There was probably a misunderstanding. A man who is not familiar with the technicalities of the trade might mistake the one for the other. I do not think that a margin of 5 per cent, is sufficient; but if the Treasurer will not agree to grant a wider margin, it is useless to take action. I may add, however, that if it be possible to reduce the duty on the raw material, I shall vote in that direction. </para>

That is the assurance that I have received from men who have to use this material. I have here a few samples of three-colour work printed in America and Australia, and I defy any one to say that the Australian product is not equal to the American. I would point out, however, that it is printed on imported paper. No less than six printers who print in colours assure me that the paper made by Messrs. Sands and McDougall is not equal to the imported. </para>

                            <para>- He knows what he is talking about. We need a fair margin, and if necessary the item covering the raw material should be recommitted. The average Customs officer would probably find it difficult to distinguish between the Australian and the imported paper, but an expert in half-an hour could teach him readily to do so by means of a magnifying glass. If the superior surface-coated board is not and cannot at present be made here, it should be placed on the free list. The firm of Messrs. Sands and McDougall seems to have <inline font-style="italic">A</inline> dominating influence over the printing community, and if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDougall</inline> would swear that hd could make high-class paper equal to the imported we should have no difficulty in deciding the matter. As it is, I prefer to accept the evidence of six witnesses as against that of one. The local firm imports the Manila board - which is dutiable at 5 per cent, and free - and coats it, and it is largely used for making cardboard boxes. 'It is our duty to see that Australian artists engaged in the colour process work are able to secure the best material in order that they may compete with the rest of the world. We have a multitude of post-cards printed in three colours. I shall endeavour if, as I have been assured, cardboard and pasteboard are not manufactured here, but merely coated after being imported, to get the Senate to reduce the duty. In my opinion, we should follow the example of Japan, and nationalize the paper industry. We should not then hear mean and paltry threats of the dismissal of workmen. I read this afternoon a letter in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDougall</inline> said that since the Tariff was introduced he could not supply a certain kind of paper for a month or six weeks, and then only at 5s. above the former price, making it 30s. instead pf 25s. a ream. This increase was charged although no duty had been paid on the raw material. I voted under a misapprehension in regard to some of the paragraphs in this item, but had I heard th; honorable member for Yarra speak I should have voted differently, and I think that the Committee would have voted differently had it known what it knows now. However, I do not suppose that I shall persuade the Treasurer to agree to a recommittal. I never yet knew a political speech to alter the vote of a member -whose mind was made up, and I do not lay the flattering unction to my soul that my speech will do so. </para>

I desire to move that the words "per lb. 6£d. and <inline font-style="italic">6d.;"</inline> and "whichever rate returns the higher duty," be omitted with a view to afterwards striking out item  355.  My desire is to make all printing and stencilling inks subject to duties of  30  per cent, and  25  per cent., and I desire to know whether the Treasurer will accept the amendment? </para>

                        <para>. - May I point out to the Treasurer that in respect to several other duties of a double-barrelled character, he has consented to adopt a uniform rate. I submit that the same principle should be observed here. The objection urged by the honorable member for Darling to the Government proposal is based upon the difficulty of accurately ascertaining the value of printers' ink. But I would point out to the honorable member that that objection applies equally to the proposed duty, which is part fixed and part <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem.</inline> I trust that the Government will not adhere to .this double-barrelled duty. The Treasurer himself has' confessed that he does not like it. The duty proposed upon some of the inks amounts to more than  100  per cent: That is a very heavy impost upon an article, the production of which does not require an expensive plant, but merely a knowledge of a recipe, and the making of fluids from certain solubles. </para>

                            <para>- If we force inferior ink upon the country newspapers - as we shall do by the imposition of high duties - it will be at the loss of their readers. These journals should not use the ink that is used by the large newspapers with bad results to the eyes of their readers. For the sake of their readers we ought not to force country newspapers to use cheap inks. The Postmaster- General is referring me to an article which was prepared under special conditions. </para>

                            <para>- I am pointing out that an ink which may be perfect in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> office may be of scarcely any use in a small country office. If their ink is taxed to the extent of 200 per cent, it can only tend to drive the proprietors of country newspapers to use an inferior ink. We ought to see if we cannot make the article a little cheaper to them so as to give them the same advantage as the large newspapers enjoy with their cheaper ink. This is essentially a tax on country newspapers, and as such ought to be discouraged. </para>

                        (Franklin) [1.17 a.m.]. - I assure the Committee that there is no more difficulty in differentiating between the varieties of printers' ink than there is in distinguishing between the varieties of any other imported article.  That statement is corroborated by inquiries which I have just made. There can be no doubt that the Treasurer is proposing an extraordinary duty, being practically equal to 100 per cent. Is the Committee prepared to vote that high tax? It has been stated that one of the reasons for keeping the fixed duty was that it was practically impossible for the Department to . distinguish between the values of the ink. But I can assure honorable members that that statement is absolutely wrong, as they can ascertain by reference to the officers of the Department. Is it desirable to place a high duty on these inks? In my opinion it is not. A duty of 25 or 20 per cent, is practically the proposal of the Tariff Commission.

Of course i know that stencilling ink is different from printing ink, but what the difference between them is I am not in a position to state at the present time. I do not see why there should be any limitation. If a man wants 50 lbs. of cheap ink he should be in a position to get it just as readily as a man who wants a ton of the article. I trust that the Minister will remove that limitation. </para>

                            <para>- I know that a number of honorable members who have gone home paired would have all voted for our proposal. If we are defeated in this thin Committee it will be simply owing to the lateness of the hour. It will certainly not represent the decision of a full Committee. But it will perpetuate a gross injustice to the users of the ink. We are not asking for a lower duty, but for that which the Government proposed in the Tariff originally, namely, 30 and 25 'per cent. I do not think that the Treasurer is justified in taking up this stand. He will not even rise and tell us why he is acting in this way. If he wants to stick to a fixed duty, why does he not propose the same rate all round? </para>

                        (Brisbane) [1.25 a.m.]. - I should like to point out, in reply to an interjection made by the Postmaster-General to the effect that if more honorable members had been present and had heard the facts of the case they would have changed their minds, that not one solitary fact has been advanced from the Ministerial side of the chamber. All the facts have been stated by those who support the amendment of the honorable member for Capricornia. Many of trie salient facts have been clearly stated by the honorable member for Franklin, who has had practical experience, and who says that if the proposed duty be carried it will have the effect of almost compelling the' country newspaper proprietors, to use cheaper ink. The effect of this would be that the high duty would defeat its object. A further effect of the duty will operate upon the readers of the country newspapers. I approach this matter in an entirely unbiased frame of mind. I have not been approached in regard to it by any one. All that T know about it has been learnt from reading the circulars which have 'been issued, and from hearing the speeches of honorable members. It appears to me that the honorable member for Capricornia is quite right in his contention, and I shall vote with him.
