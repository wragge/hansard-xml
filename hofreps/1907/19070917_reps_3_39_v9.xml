The Minister of Defence is in Sydney at the present time, making inquiry into that amongst other thinlgs. The honorable member may depend upon it that the Government will not lose sight of such a serious state of affairs as is represented. </para>

                        <para>I am fully seized of the importance of comparative statistical records of school physique and school hygiene ; and consider that the value of such records would be greatly enhanced if they were made on a uniform plan for the whole of Australia. The subject has already received some attention in the Commonwealth - i.e., in New South Wales and Tasmania - but the records, while possessing a certain local value, do not cover a sufficient number of children or refer to a sufficient number of different years to possess comprehensive significance. It was suggested by the Premier of Tasmania, towards the close of 1906, that the various States should be invited to undertake the work of collecting complete data, and the Honorable the Minister for Home Affairs expressed his concurrence in the proposal that the Commonwealth Statistician should analyze and tabulate the results. Communications were addressed to the Premiers of the States, but owing to the fact that unfavorable replies were received in some instances, I understand the matter has not been further proceeded with. </para>

                                <para>- I desire to say a few words upon the whole of these Estimates, before the details are submitted to the Committee. In dealing with this matter, it is only right that I should refer to the total expenditure involved, and to certain questions in connexion with the Budget which, in my judgment, come within the purview of the Government proposals. It has been said that although the revenue derived by the Commonwealth during the first year of the operation of the uniform Tariff - 1902-3. - was £1,640,000 less than the amount which it is anticipated will be collected during the current financial year, the sum of £1,145,234 in excess of their three-fourths share of the Customs and Excise revenue was returned to the States, whereas during the present year, it is expected that they will receive only £103,992 more than the three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue to which they are constitutionally entitled. To put the matter even more clearly, I would say that out of a total revenue of £12,105,937 in 1902-3, the Commonwealth Treasurer was able to return to the States £8,204,563, whereas during the current financial year, with an anticipated revenue of £13,745,200 - a revenue exceeding that which was collected in 1902-3 by £1,639,263 - the Treasurer estimates that he will be able to return to them only £7,779,290, That is to say, the States will receive £425,273 less than the amount returned in 1902-3. The inference to be drawn from these criticisms is, I presume, that the Commonwealth should return to the States in 1906-7 , £8,204,563, the amount returned in 1902-3, plus the £1,639,263, the increase in revenue estimated during 1907-8 - in all £9,843,826. The amount estimated to be returned to the States this year is £2,066,618 less than that amount. </para>

                        <para class="block">The contention of some honorable members would have been quite correct, on one supposition, namely, that the expenditure had remained stationary. This, however, has not occurred. I will enumerate the items of expenditure occurring in the Estimates for 1907-8 which did not occur in 1902-3. I ask honorable members to take special notice of the amounts which I am about to submit. We now pay £5,000 per annum in connexion with Papua. This amount is in the nature of a loan to be used for the construction of roads. The repatriation of Pacific islanders involves an expenditure of £6,500, being the balance required for returning the kanakas to their islands. The expenditure on advertising our resources in Great Britain amounts to £20,000, and is mainly expended in Great Britain. The Commonwealth London office accounts for £4,400. This office has justified its existence. Last year interest was earned in London amounting to £2,852, the rates varying from2¼ per cent. to 5½ per cent. Before the creation of this London office the Commonwealth earned no interest in London whatever, all our remittances being made to the Agents-General of the various States, and forming part of their balances. So that honorable members will see that there has been a great saving in connexion with our London office. Our Crown Solicitor's office, which did not exist in 1902-3, involves an expenditure of £3,360. The High Court was not in existence at the time to which I have referred, and the expenditure upon it amounts to £22,145. </para>

                                <para>- I take the whole period of the Commonwealth's existence. I am not picking out any particular case, but desire to show truly what has taken place, and why we are spending more money now than we did at the commencement. In so doing, my object is partly to show that the States have been relieved of a considerable amount of expenditure, although, nevertheless, some of them have not reduced, but have increased their own expenditure. </para>

                                <para>- The Commonwealth Meteorological Department involves an expenditure of  £15,996.  This is an amount of expenditure directly transferred from the States. I hold that they should be relieved of an expenditure of at least  £10,000  odd. Our Patent Office involves an expenditure of  £13,357.  That also is a relief of the States. </para>

                                <para>- Our net expenditure on account of trade marks is  £3,838.  In  1906-7  the expenditure amounted to  £6,390,  and the receipts to  £3,951.  The abolition of the cable charges between the mainland and Tasmania has cost the Commonwealth  £8,781.  In consequence of the abolition of the charge of½d. per word on cable messages we have to pay the Eastern Extension Company  £5,600  per annum. The balance represents arrears. </para>

                                <para>- The three States concerned paid it at that time, I suppose. The expenditure on new bounties amounts to  £25,000.  There is also to be spent this year a sum of  £15,000  on the survey for the transcontinental railway ; and here let me say that if a promise was ever made regarding the construction of that line, or a promise to do justice to Western Australia, at the time when she entered the Federation, that promise ought to be carried out regardless of any factious opposition. Provision is made for the repayment to the Government of New South Wales of an advance of  £25,000.  This advance was made prior to Federation by the New South Wales Government for Savings Bank business, and it was also used for money order purposes. The New South Wales Government now wish this sum to be repaid to the Savings Banks Commissioners; and, therefore, a new advance from the Commonwealth funds is necessary. The money represents the amount that was in the tills at the time the Commonwealth took over the Department. With the addition of the other items I have quoted, it will be seen that, in all, there is a sum of £203,185, which did  not appear in any way in the expenditure of 1902-3, but' which is now necessary; and in many respects this means a relief to the States. In respect of the Governor-General, there is this year an increase of ^5,758. In the present Estimates, £1,000 is included for services rendered by the Railway Departments of the various States - an amount that was not charged in 1902-3. In addition, we are providing this year for repairs, furniture, and so forth, for the Government Houses in Sydney and Melbourne, to the amount of £5,985 more than in 1902-3, and the total expenditure under this head is ^20,389. In regard to the item of £1,000 especially, I wish to say that in 1902-3 the Railway Departments of the States did not charge for the conveyance of the Governor-General, though I do not remember whether a charge was made on account of members of Parliament. </para>

                                <para>- Quite so, and in justice to the Commonwealth, in view of statements that are made, I desire the fact to be placed on record. I am not accusing any Treasurer or Government of extravagance - far from it; but I desire the position to be made clear by means of figures from the Secretary to the Treasury. Under the heading of Parliament there is an increase of £34,588. The main item of the increase is that of £27,863 in connexion with the electoral administration. There is an item of £6,000 for a new mail service to the Pacific islands, one to the New Hebrides, and the other islands, involving £4,500, and another to New Guinea involving  ,£1,500.  The Public Works staff is represented by an increase of -£7,066. In 1902-3, the sum of £44,178 was paid for the construction of buildings and so forth, and for 1907-8 provision is made for £221,824. I desire to point out that in 1902-3, practically no works were being proceeded with. We were not in the position at that time to know where works should be carried out ; but each year since the expenditure has been growing. We have to. keep all the buildings in repair, and, especially in the Post and Telegraph Department, offices have to be extended, in addition to the ordinary repairs over the whole continent of Australia. I may say that the buildings were discovered to be in very bad repair, indeed, in 1902-3 and subsequently ; and, therefore, more work, and, of course., more expenditure is now necessary. </para>

                                <para>- Quite so; whatever happens we must keep the buildings in repair. Under the head of Naval Agreement, there is an increase of £95'°35- I" i902-3 we paid ,£126,000 per annum, which was shared with New Zealand on a population basis. We now Pa)' £200,000 per annum, and the  £95,035  is necessary, partly to meet the increase and the share formerly paid by New Zealand. Naval expenditure "other" is represented by an increase of £15,788. In 1902-3 the Naval' Forces were severely retrenched, but since then this  arm  of the service has been strengthened. " The increase in the military expenditure is £98,299. This increase is a large one, and I desire honorable members to observe the cause. On account of rifle clubs, there is a sum .of ,£24,057, and, I presume, no honorable member will raise any objection on this score, because I believe the expenditure on these clubs has the approval of all. Then cadet corps are represented by £46,902 ; and I think I am safe in saying that the Parliament of the Commonwealth will cordially approve of both this and the item I have just mentioned. The balance of the increase is caused by bringing the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the various arms of the Defence Forces nearer to the maximum strength ; and there has been a corresponding increase in the cost of equipment. The defence works, under the head of ' ' maintenance, ! ' are responsible for an increase of £15,586, and it is proposed this year to renew the boilers of the naval vessels. In 1902-3, all alterations and improvements were charged to the new works vote, but that is not 'done now. The increase in the Postmaster-General's, </para>

In connexion with the expenditure on account of the conveyance of mails across Bass Strait, I think the action of the Government will show the representatives of Tasmania how groundless is the charge that the Commonwealth Government are neglectful of that Sta.te. An item of £7,000 represents the increase in the expenditure necessary to secure the more rapid service provided by the fine steam-ship <inline font-style="italic">Loongana.</inline> I am quite sure that Tasmanians, and, indeed, all Australians who travel, must agree that this is an expenditure to be commended, and that it must have been a relief to the Tasmanian Government, who could have ill afforded to pay the extra cost. </para>

                                <para>- There are also increases iri the revenue. That for 1902-3 was  £2,404,730, whilst the estimate for 1907-8 is £3,190,000, or an increase of £785,270. It should be stated that £130,000 of the increase is due to the system of charging now adopted by the different Departments. I should explain that for some time in the Commonwealth we followed the practice which used to be adopted in New South Wales under which one Department of the Public Service did work for another without charge. For instance, the Railway Department of a State  did not charge for work done for the Postal Department of the State. At the present time each Department charges every other for work done for it. It, of course, makes no actual difference in the cost, but the practice is convenient, as showing accurately the value of the services performed by each Department. This practice was not followed in 1902-3. The estimate I have quoted for 1907-8 allows for a loss of £117,000 on penny postage. Very many of the charges to the public have been reduced since 1902-3. </para>

                                <para>- In 1902-3 the receipts were £27,343 under the expenditure. But that calculation does not include a sum of £135,699 on new post offices. In 1907-8 it is estimated that the receipts instead of being £27,343 less, will amount to £324,891 in excess of the expenditure. If honorable members will turn to page 70 of the Budget papers they will see a reference to an item of £434,078 for expenditure on new works and buildings. I  desire to say that in the past in some of the States at all events, these payments were made chiefly from borrowed money. They are now paid out of revenue, but I am not quite sure that they should not be charged against the Post and Telegraph Department. If that course were adopted, the expenditure would be in excess of the revenue. </para>

I wish to place the matter clearly before honorable members, because it is impossible to make a true comparison between what was done previously by the States and what we are now doing, unless' it is remembered that a large portion of this expenditure was previously defrayed from loan money. I refer to the matter only incidentally to show that if the accounts of the Department were kept as they were under the management of the States Governments it would be shown that the deficiency was very much greater before we took over the Departments. </para>

                                <para>- It would cover the whole of the operations of the Post and Telegraph Departments. I agree with the honorable member for South Sydney that it would be a good thing to do as he suggests, and I hope it will be done. A statement should be published every year, not only in regard to expenditure and receipts, but in regard to appointments, dismissals, removals, and other changes in the Department. There is an increase of £23,541 in respect of pensions and retiring allowances, under section 84 of the Constitution. The rights to these pensions are secured to certain officers under the section mentioned, and the rates are fixed by States' laws and practice at the date of the transfer of the Departments to the Commonwealth. Honorable members will therefore see that we are compelled to pay this amount under the Constitution.. </para>

                                <para>- The sugar bounty, as I have said, involves an expenditure of £519,496, and sundry items not detailed represent£900, making a total increase of £2,066,621 in the Federal expenditure for 1907-8 as compared with that for 1902-3. I have no hesitation in asking the Committee to say whether, save by repealing the Sugar Bounty Act, that expenditure could be fairly reduced. In many cases it represents expenditure taken over from the States. </para>

                                <para>- It is a fairly large sum. I should be glad if the honorable member would point to any item in the Estimates which could be largely reduced. I venture to think that there will be very little objection to the Estimates as submitted, and that it will be difficult to suggest where any material reduction could reasonably be made. I have here another return showing the expenditure estimated to be made by the Commonwealth in 1907-8, and which would have been made by the States if the Commonwealth had not been established- </para>

                                <para>- During the recent State election campaign, it was stated that the Government of New South Wales intended to repeal the income tax, to increase the pay of the police, and to reduce school fees by £85,000. These concessions are made possible because of the large sums that we have handed over to the States. The. Commonwealth is blamed for imposing taxation, and whilst we are handing over to the States most of the money so obtained, and thus enabling them to relieve the people of various imposts, we are held to be responsible for all the ills from which it is alleged they are suffering. </para>

With regard to the revenue from sugar, the 'receipts from Customs duty on sugar, including glucose&gt; are estimated at £68,000 for the year 1907-8. The estimated revenue from- Excise is £746,000. From that has to be deducted the bounty of £573,000, leaving' a balance of £173,000, which, adding the £68,000 Customs duty, gives a total estimated revenue from this source of £241,000. When we repay to the States three-quarters of the Customs and Excise duties, we lose £369.500 on the transaction. Therefore in order to pay the bounty to Queensland we have to debit our own accounts with that large sum of nearly £400,000 to enable us to carry! out the Act. I feel sure that at the time the first Sugar Bounty Act was passed, it was not contemplated that the loss to the Commonwealth revenue would be so large, or probably some other means would have been adopted. Still, thai is the law, and we have to carry it out. </para>

                                <para>- It would go to the consuming States. The total receipts from Customs and Excise duties on sugar are estimated at £814,000. One quarter of that sum is £203,500. We repay in bounty £573,000, so that, as I said, we  are £369,500 to the bad on the transaction. I wish to deal with the question that has been raised as to the amount of money that we shall have to repay to the States in the future. The estimated revenue from Customs and Excise for the current year is £10,509,000. It has been predicted, judging from the; effect of a somewhat similar Tariff in Victoria in 1892, that the receipts are likely to drop in a few years to £9,000,000. But in the Victorian case there were not, I think, so many Excise items. I admit, however, that the total receipts will probably be reduced after a year or two. But what will be the position if the receipts do fall to £9,000,000? Assuming that the expenditure was not increased, this would be the effect - </para>

It has been stated during the debate that the revenue would fall very shortly to £9,000,000, and an example was given of another Tariff. It was argued that if, in consequence of its protective character, it decreased the' amount of imports, the receipts under it would probably in two years fall to .£9,000,000. I am showing what the result would be to the States if that happened. </para>

                                <para>- I do not care for what purpose the statement was made. I am taking the statement as it was made, and showing the position in which the States will be. I hold that it will be found necessary in the future to expend considerable sums under the head of new works and buildings, and, in addition, as we expand we shall have to expend larger sums. That would make the case still worse, sofar as the States are concerned. The expenditure under the special defence votes for this year amounts to  £296,050,  and when the expenditure for coastal defence is fairly started, it will annually be a very large sum. The honorable member for Flinders pointed out the difficulty with which we may be faced, and suggested two ways of meeting it. . One was by cutting down the expenditure on the Civil Service, and stopping the increments to civil servants, and the other by resorting to loans. </para>

Russia stands at the top with an average of 131 per cent. on British imports, and Australia is near the bottom with an average of 6 per cent. In the case of New Zealand, the average is 9 per cent., while in the case of Canada it is 17 per cent. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member for Flinders pointed out the difficulty confronting us. But, as I said, he did not point out any possible decrease in ordinary expenditure, except in one case where he urged that the civil servants should not be paid their increases, and that in other cases salaries might be reduced. The Committee will agree, I think, that any considerable reduction in expenditure is not possible. The only Departments in which it could be urged that a reduction could be made, but in which I think it is hardly possible, are the Defence and Post and Telegraph Departments. We cannot cut down the expenditure on the Defence Department if we earnestly intend to strengthen our defence. We cannot cut down the expenditure on the Post and Telegraph Department without impairing its efficiency, and reducing the conveniences which it supplies to the public. I venture to think that the Committee is not prepared to do one or other of those things. As regards the possibility of effecting any saving by reducing the amounts of increments paid to junior officers in the service, I find that the total amount of the increments to be paid this year to fifth class officers is only £5,810. These youths enter the service between the ages of <inline font-style="italic">16</inline> and 21 years, so that even if they should get their statutory increment each year they will be between the ages of 22 and 27 before they can attain a salary of £160 a year. </para>

                                <para>- No. Allowing three years to intervene before the lads receive promotion to fourth class, they are from 25 to 30 years of age before they receive a salary of £185. Perhaps after that their promotion should be guided largely, if not wholly, by merit, but not before. That is the position of these young men, rising gradually, as they do, and not too rapidly, to a position carrying a salary of £185 a year. </para>

So far as it can be calculated, it is estimated that if the duties levied on British goods only were levied on all imports there would be a reduction of £500,000 in the estimated revenue of £8,229,000 from the new Tariff. </para>

In the first week of September last year they were £22,279, and rose to £24,510 this year, and in the second week of September last year they were £15,559, and increased to £18,382 this year. Therefore, Queensland, too, is benefiting by the new Tariff. The position of Western Australia is different. For the week beginning 8th August last year, the returns in that State were £16,074, and in the corresponding period of this year they fell to £13,375. In the following week of last year they were £20,222, and this year fell to £13,477; and in the last week of August last year they were £33,474, and this year £29,669. In the first week of September last year they were £11,637, and this year £6,012; and in the second week last year £16,156, and this year £12,459. The figures for South Australia for the five weeks' period to which I have been referring are, in the first week, last year, £13,075, and this year £15,099 ; in the second week last year £19,061, and this year £17,921 ; in the third week last year £26,071, and this year £35,096 ; in the fourth week last year £12,214, and this year £23,094; and in the fifth week last year £11,862, and this year £18,773. So that in some weeks the revenue under the new Tariff was nearly twice as much as that received under the old Tariff. </para>

                                <para>- Not at all. Of course, those provisions would not be binding on Parliament; they were adopted subject to ratification by Parliament. With regard to the other question - the continuation of the operation of the Braddon section - it appears very evident from the figures I have quoted this evening that such an arrangement, however desirable to the States, will be quite impossible in view of public expenditure which must be carried out by the Commonwealth. I have been called so suddenly to take the position I now occupy, and have had so little opportunity of considering this question, that I feel that some lime must elapse before my views are thoroughly matured. </para>

Let us see what the official report of the proceedings of that Conference discloses. In the first place, I affirmed that the Prime Minister never authorized what was attempted to be done there. I will quote his very words in support of my statement. If honorable members will refer to pages  200, 238, 239, 241, 244,  and  245  of the official report, they will see the position for themselves.

The proposed extension of the Braddon section represented only a portion of the proposals made bv the Commonwealth Government to the States - a portion to which, by itself, the Prime Minister does not adhere, and to which he did not give his consent. According to the official report of the Conference held at Brisbane, the right honorable member for Swan said - </para>

If the right honorable member says that by subscribing to an arrangement under which the Commonwealth would continue to return to the States three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue, and would retain only one-fourth of that revenue for Commonwealth purposes, we should not be extending the Braddon section of the Constitution, I say that there is no meaning in words. </para>

                                <para>- The Acting Prime Minister has asked me a question - Whether he would be in order in dealing with matters connected with the Tariff in Committee of Supply? I must rule that he would not be in order, for the following reason : - It would certainly be a new procedure, and one that ought not to be permitted, to have two debates in the two Committees of Supply and Ways and Means running on parallel lines. If I permitted the Minister to do what he desires, we should have a similar debate in Committee of Ways and Means to that which the Minister proposes to initiate in Committee of Supply.  I realize the difficulty in which we are situated owing to the fact that there is no standing  order to guide us, whilst the references made to the point in May's <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Practice</inline> are so vague that they afford no light upon the situation. The House goes into Committee of Ways and Means for the purpose of devising methods of raising revenue. But we are now in Committee of Supply. While in Committee of Supply, we deal with the manner in which revenue shall be expended. It is, of course, only reasonable and right that honorable members should be allowed in a general way in Committee of Supply to make reference to the manner in which money to be expended shall be obtained. The Minister himself has made certain general statements concerning the probable revenue of the Commonwealth. He was quite in order in taking that course. But to refer in detail to matters connected with the Tariff would not be in order. The proper place in which to make those observations would be, not \n Committee of Supply, but in Committee of Ways and Means. </para>

These proposals include measures to be taken for the protection of the workers, of the manufacturers, and of the public. If you rule that I cannot proceed further, I have finished what I intended to say. </para>

                                <para>-  But this is not a hypothetical question. It is a question of procedure to which we ought to have an answer. The " new protection," or the rate of any item of the Tariff, or of any duty, or proposal regarding Excise, must, affect the financial proposals of the Government, and consequently must have some relation to Supply. The honorable member for Angas has asked whether any honorable member - because, of course, the same privilege as was extended to the Acting Prime Minister would be extended to other honorable members - would be at liberty to refer in a. general way in this Committee to the " new protection," or to any proposed duty of Customs or of Excise having regard to its bearing upon the finances. That I take it, is the question put by the honorable member for Angas, and I think we are entitled to have it answered. It is not a question of the convenience of the Acting Prime Minister just now, but a Question of laying down an important precedent. Indeed, it is a matter which affects the freedom of speech in this House, and the right of honorable members . to discuss, in the fullest manner possible, questions which come before them affecting the finances. We all know the golden rule that we may discuss grievances before Supply is granted, and I should like to hear an answer to the question put by the honorable member for Angas. </para>

                                <para>- As to freedom of speech, and the discussion of grievances before Supply, I remind honorable members that our action in that connexion is limited by our standing order, to the effect that we shall discuss grievances before the granting of Supply only once every three weeks. That rule is laid down definitely in our Standing Orders, beyond which we cannot go. I have already pointed out that questions of Ways and Means and questions of Supply are so involved that it is almost impossible to discuss one without considering the other. While questions of Ways and Means ought to be discussed in Committee of Ways and Means, and questions of Supply discussed in Committee of Supply, it is only reasonable to suppose that the discussions may sometimes overlap. But seeing that we are in Committee of Supply, I must rule against any detailed discussion of the Tariff, because that is a discussion which must take place in Committee of Ways and Means. It is obvious that Supply will be affected by the Tariff to a greater or less extent, because the Tariff is one of the  means by which 'we make good Supply, and, therefore, a general reference to the Tariff cannot well ba avoided, just as in Committee of Ways and Means, when we are dealing with the Tariff, a general reference to Supply cannot be avoided. I point out that we are in the peculiar position of having this question introduced both in Committee of Supply and in. Committee of Ways and Means, and I do not see how some reference to the Tariff could possibly be avoided in this Committee.  However, I rule that it would not be in order to deal with the details of the Tariff while we are in Committee of Supply. </para>

                                <para>- I gathered from what took place on Friday that that would probably be your ruling, from which I do not propose to dissent on the present occasion. I must say, however, that I was of opinion we had a larger range of discussion. I moved the House into Committee of Supply in order to deal with the matters with which I have dealt this afternoon ; and when we get back into Committee of Ways and Means I shall be prepared to proceed with the remarks I had intended to make on Friday last. . I think I have shown to-day that the Commonwealth has not been extravagant in its expenditure, and that there can be but little reduction made. </para>

                                <para>- And hope deferred has been the honorable member's trouble. As I was saying, there can be but little saving effected in the Estimates now before honorable members. We must look forward, at no distant date, to considerable expenditure if we take over the Northern Territory ; and, further, I hope that it will not be long before we shall have to make provision for the construction of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway. Both these undertakings will mean a considerable addition to the expenditure. </para>

                                <para>- No reply has yet been received from the South Australian Government, but I presume they will carryout a promise which undoubtedly was made. However, that is a question with which I do not desire to deal at the present moment. When I delivered my Budget speech, and also this afternoon, I showed that the Commonwealth will require all the money we are likely to receive as a result of the present Tariff, in order to keep our engagements with the States during the next three years or so. I have pointed out the danger to the revenue which would result from reducing the Tariff. At present the revenue is rising, and is sufficient to enable us to carry out intended works, and, perhaps, a considerable number of other works not proposed on the present occasion. I strongly impress upon honorable members that we must deal with the Tariff in such a way as not only to make it protective to our industries, but to cause it to continue to return the revenue we receive at present. In deference to your ruling, sir, I shall not deal in detail with the Tariff, though I should be very much tempted to do so were it not that I have no wish to come into conflict with the Chair. As I said before, when we get into Committee of Ways and Means I shall, on the first item, deal with the Tariff to the extent I had intended on Friday last. At present we shall proceed with the consideration of the Works Estimates, and as there is little or nothing to object to in these Estimates, I earnestly ask honorable members to deal with them as quickly as possible. If the Estimates are not dealt with promptly, it is possible that some works may have to be stopped; indeed, that is the reason the Estimates are placed before honorable members at the present time. </para>

                            <para>. - I sympathize to the full with the desire of the Acting Prime Minister to have the consideration of these Estimates concluded as speedily as possible; I mean, of course, as speedily as is consistent with a fair and just review of the items, in order to insure that the money is not voted without proper consideration, and that we are getting the worth of the money we vote. These are always considerations with honorable members, no matter what haste may be desired in regard to the Estimates or any other question. I should now like to make one or two observations regarding some of the statements which the Acting Prime Minister has thought fit to make in regard to the state of the finances. Although there has been no criticism of anything I took the opportunity to say during my speech on the Budget, there are, none the less, matters of general importance in reference to which I should like, in the first place, to correct some of the statements of the Acting Prime Minister, and, in the second place, to show' how inadequate, in my judgment, was the address of the honorable gentleman this afternoon. The Acting Prime Minister has fallen short of the request made in all the criticism on the Budget, for a <inline font-style="italic">sketch</inline> of the financial outlook from the Government point of view, and of the needs of the Commonwealth during the next few years, particularly in the light of the Tariff. During his observations this afternoon, the Acting Prime Minister treated us to a comparison of the revenue of to-day and of the revenue as it stood years ago in New South Wales. For instance, the honorable gentleman went back to 1899 in order to afford a comparison of the revenue required by the Government of that State then with the revenue required to-day. I do not know why the honorable gentleman did so, unless, to put it vulgarly, he desired to have a dig at <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers,</inline> who seems just now to be his <inline font-style="italic">bête noire.</inline></para>

                                <para>- I am aware of that. What the honorable gentleman did was to show that the Government of New South Wales is expending £2,000,000 per annum more to-day than it expended in 1899. Why did he not, at the same time, tell the Committee that his Government succeeded to power in New South Wales in 1899, and that the moment at which his Government has succeeded to power in New South Wales, or anywhere else, has synchronized with a swift upward leap of public expenditure? The honorable gentleman is noted for his spending proclivities. It was' the Government that he put into power that increased the expenditure in New South Wales by no less a sum than £2, 500,000.Honorable members who have any political experience know how difficult it is once expenditure has been increased to reduce it to what it was before the increase. Somehow or other, public expenditure always creates vested interests. Departments are increased to pretentious proportions, and it is with the greatest difficulty in the world that they can be reduced to their original proportions without very great injustice and hardship to individuals. The Acting Prime Minister, therefore, has to-day unconsciously informed the Committee of one of the enormities of which his Government in New South Wales was guilty in sending expenditure up to a figure which it has not since been possible to substantially reduce. This should make us only the more careful as to our financial dispositions so far as the Commonwealth is concerned. When we know that it is so difficult in the government of a State to bring about a return to normal financial conditions, there is all the more reason why we should, during the period of financial boom through which we are passing, husband our resources, and not play the part of the spendthrift with them. I can conceive of no more salutary illustration than that to which the Acting Prime Minister has referred us in connexion with Government expenditure in New South Wales. The honorable gentleman was at great pains to tell us of the very large Federal expenditure which has been incurred since we took over our functions of government. A great deal of expenditure has been incurred to which no one can take any exception. Every one listened quite sympathetically to the narration by the honorable gentleman of the items of expenditure incurred in the proper and normal discharge of our Federal functions. But I venture to say that the Acting Prime Minister's statement was still quite inadequate. We all knew these things before. No one quarrelled with them. The honorable members for Flinders, Parkes, and Swan have repeatedly said that they do not challenge these particular items. That has not been the criticism from this side at all. The criticism has been that all this piling up of expenditure, legitimate though it may be, is very speedily creating for us a very serious Federal financial outlook. That is the challenge which has been addressed from this side to the Acting Prime Minister. </para>

We are to take the honest course of raising moneys before we undertake the spending of them. What we say is, that these items of expenditure constantly piling up show the necessity for proceeding cautiously with such proposals as those which are contained in the Tariff, which must necessarily destroy revenue if they are to have a protective incidence, and to attain the object at which the protectionist authors of the Tariff are aiming. </para>

                                <para>- Quite so. We were reminded of this last night at that particularly cordial meeting which Ministers addressed at Brunswick. I congratulate Ministers on the cordial reception which they receive whenever they address public meetings. I suppose we must take the tone of last night's meeting as a complete justification for their proceeding with the Tariff. It was no doubt a booming success in every way from the fiscal propaganda point of view. I have no wish to discuss that meeting, but the Postmaster-General reminded his audience that three years ago he called attention to the fact that industries were being strangled. in Victoria. It has taken over three years to prepare this remedy, and now that they have it prepared I charge the Government with loitering over its application. I say that they are loitering over the Tariff, and show no disposition to get to close grips with it, and put the strangled industries upon a permanent basis. After three years of struggling, industries which have continued to pay handsome dividends- </para>

                                <para>- I am dealing with the financial aspect only. During that time the volume of business in all these industries has increased, but notwithstanding the statement that they have been struggling for three years, there is still no disposition on the part of the Government to put them on a permanent footing. Passing from that, I should like to say that in my judgment the Acting Prime Minister has not replied to the criticism from this side. Our criticism has been that the Tariff will in all probability be ultimately in a form which will give us a revenue of £9,000,000. </para>

                                <para>- Quite so. The Tariff, in proportion as it becomes protective, must have the effect of destroying revenue from imports. The Acting Prime Minister will not deny that, having just said the same thing in other words. We are forced to supply a basis of our own, since the honorable gentleman will not favour us with the probable results from the point of view of the Treasury. I thought that this afternoon we should have heard a definite statement as to the financial outlook, and the bearing of the Tariff upon it, after the infinite pains at which the honorable gentleman has been to state the financial position. Whether we have been economical or extravagant is not the point at issue. We desire to know our financial bearings before we set out to reduce or increase the revenue-pro-" during capacity of the Tariff. On this subject we get no guidance from what the honorable gentleman has said this afternoon. We should have been informed of the financial outlook, and the honorable gentleman should give the Committee some forecast for the next two or three years before he asks us to deal with the Tariff. We have no reliable data to guide us, and the Government have at least no right to sneer at the Opposition, as some of them did at a public meeting held last night at Brunswick, and to ask whether or not certain honorable members on this side of the House are protectionists. </para>

                                <para>- Quite so, but the honorable member has not replied to the question as to how our increased expenditure, necessarily extended as Commonwealth development proceeds, is to be permanently safeguarded. That is the issue, and the honorable member is challenged to deal with it. Before we set out upon our detailed discussion of the Tariff we need some information on the point. </para>

                                <para>- I had indeed. When I find that the honorable member is amiable to the Opposition, I should do so as much for the safety of honorable members on this side of the House as for anything else. The Acting Prime Minister is putting the cart before the horse. He says to us in effect, " Fix this Tariff as you please, and then I shall be able to forecast the financial future." The matter at issue between us is very simple. We say to the Government, " Let us know what is the financial outlook, so that we may know how far to proceed with the destruction of revenue in the consideration of the Tariff." I venture to say that while the honorable member may be unable to forecast with accuracy what will be the financial position some years ahead, he should be able to look ahead, as <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner, the right honorable member for Adelaide, and every Treasurer has tried to do, for at least several years. The Government would have been well advised had they refrained from touching the Tariff for another year or two. I believe that for purely financial reasons it should not have been touched for some time. We may revise it now if honorable members desire to do so, but there can be no doubt that there will have to be further Tariff revisions after the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States have been settled in 1910. </para>

                                <para>- It is full of anomalies, and will require considerable re-adjustment, but I am not now dealing with that point. There are purely financial considerations which might very well render Tariff re-adjustments necessary after our financial, relations with the States have been permanently fixed. With such frequent reconstructions of the Government, however, one begins to despair of any definite arrangement being made with the States. We do- not know where we are; the office of Treasurer passes from one member of the Ministry to another ; and every arrangement is changed during the course of a few months. It seems absolutely impossible to forecast the future, and to indicate what may happen even six or twelve months ahead. In such circumstances, it is the bounden duty of every honorable member to try to apply passionless logic to the financial question, and even to attempt to make a forecast, since the Government themselves, with all the resources at their command, refuse to do so. That is all the honorable member for Flinders did the other night. He attempted to make a forecast, saying distinctly that it was a rough and ready one, and no man could do more when he had not the resources of the Treasury behind him. Instead of dealing with that forecast, as he ought to have done - instead of attempting to correct the honorable member's outlook - the Acting Prime Minister to-day set out to show that if we proceeded upon the basis indicated by the honorable member for Flinders we should have a huge deficit. That was exactly what the honorable member for Flinders pointed out. The whole point of his argument was that if we proceeded on, the basis of an annual revenue of £9,000,000 from Customs and Excise, we should find ourselves at the end of 191.0 face to face with liabilities amounting to no less than £1,000,000, which we should be unable to meet. That is the criticism which the Acting Prime Minister was asked to meet ; instead of meeting it, he has burked it. He can give us no statement of his own as to the outlook; he has none to give, and perhaps has not even considered' the question. All that he has done has been to quote the flowing revenues of to-day. Any one who knows anything about business matters is aware that the revenue must necessarily increase whilst traders are unloading their stocks and before the Tariff has had time to operate in the direction of preventing imports and setting up the local supplies to meet the demands which- arise from day to day. Every one knows that, none better than the Acting Prime Minister. The relation of those figures, showing that to-day there is an overflowing revenue from the Customs, mattered little. Everybody knows that for this year there will be an overflowing revenue. An extra revenue of £1,000,000 ib provided for in the Estimates. </para>

                                <para>- I beg the honorable gentleman's pardon ; the extra sum is estimated to be received from the Post and Telegraph Department. The question, then, is whether this rate of revenue is going to be maintained in the years that are to follow. If it is, then what becomes of the protective incidence of the new duties ? I : take it that' . their main function is to destroy revenue by setting up local works to supply the demands which are now supplied from oversea. It was incumbent upon the Treasurer, with all these serious obligations immediately in front pf him, to attempt to scan the financial horizon, to show us what revenue he expected from the new duties when they had settled down, and what the probable financial obligations of the near future  were to be. In my judgment we are making somewhat of a mistake in proceeding with this Tariff at the present time. When <inline font-style="italic">vie</inline> set out on our Federal career it was 'anticipated that the first ten years would be years of adjustment, and of the taking over of new functions, with the finances, therefore, somewhat . unsettled. That was the reason, I take it, why the financial safeguards were included in the Constitution. It was said in the Convention that whatever re-adjustments were to be made, whether they were to be economical or extravagant, the States at least should be safeguarded during the period' of adjustment. As I have already said, when that period closes, with the close of the year 1910, it is inevitable that our financial outlook will have to be re-adjusted to the new conditions. That this was in the minds of Ministers themselves at the outset of our Federal career is quite plain from the records. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton declared that we could not have during the bookkeeping period, and trie period of the Braddon section, any definite settlement of the financial relations between the States and the Commonwealth. Accordingly he said that we should have a compromise Tariff which could be supported by freetraders and protectionists.  His  colleague, the present Acting Prime Minister, said the same. He repeatedly asked for the support of free-traders in his first electioneering campaign, and hoped confidently that he would get it, because he said, ' ' We cannot have a protective Tariff until the year 1910. It must be a Tariff averaging from 10 per cent, to 15 per cent." </para>

                                <para>- That statement was reported in the same paper as having been made at two other meetings within a period of three or four weeks from the time it was first made. There were three or four distinct statements repeated by that paper, showing the honorable member to have said what I have just indicated. What shall we say of another member of that Ministry - a man who (would never, upon any other basis than that of a fiscal truce, have seen these Houses of Parliament as one of the representatives of New South Wales? He accused people who proposed to raise the fiscal issue in New South Wales of being traitors to the Commonwealth. On the basis that there could be no scientific protection for some years at least, all our initial arrangements were made. So far as I am able to judge, those forecasts have proved to be singularly accurate. It is not the forecasts that are wrong. It is our politics that, in the meantime, have not adjusted themselves to the forecasts that were then made, or - shall I say?- to the inevitable conditions arising from the very act of Federation. No sooner was that Tariff brought into operation than we heard the cry of " strangled industries," and so, because ,of those strangled industries in one State, we have this new Tariff brought down three years after the cry was raised Now we are face to face with a financial outlook which, I venture to say, is of the most menacing and serious kind. The seriousness of the outlook arises from the very fact that this Tariff is to further destroy revenue, and, therefore, before we adopt it, we have a right to know what the financial prospects require of us, so that we can, on the basis of the figures supplied by the Treasurer, and on the basis of past experience, so adjust the Tariff as to insure the receipt of sufficient revenue to meet our needs in the years that are to come. It is idle, therefore, to quote the Tariffs, in the way they have been quoted this afternoon, of Canada, the United States, and other countries. There is no analogy between the cases. Ours is a very different Federation from that of Canada. We are not able to deal as airily and lightly with our financial position as they may be able to do in Canada, where the Federation has control of the greater portion of the functions of Government, and leaves little for the States to do. Ours is a different problem from theirs. Say what you will, do what you will, turn this Tariff about as you will, the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States will always to a certain degree colour your financial outlook, and make for you your Tariff problems as  well. I cafe not how you act, you cannot escape from that responsibility, unless you take an easy and short cut to those other sources of taxation to which reference has already been made in this debate. But, assuming for the present that we are going to finance Federation- </para>

                                <para>- The honorable gentleman is, I take it, fixing a Tariff for many years ahead. He is forecasting with respect to the Tariff at least. I call the attention of honorable members to his light and airy way of disposing of the financial outlook of the Commonwealth. He - the Treasurer - declines to have anything to do with the financial outlook for even two or three years ahead. What is the immediate financial outlook? We have to look two or three years ahead, and more, before we can fully realize what it is. The question of taking over the Northern Territory is not likely to be disposed of in less than two or three years. </para>

                                <para>- The only trouble is that that proposal is included in the Government programme for this session. Is the honorable gentleman now repudiating the programme with which the Government met Parliament only a few weeks ago? If he says now that they do not intend to go on with all the large items of expenditure which were then forecasted, it will make the position very much simpler and the outlook very much easier. But I am assuming that their programme was honest and straightforward. I assume that the Government intend to deal with the transfer of the Northern Territory during this session. </para>

                                <para>- South Australia has not refused to agree, and I shall be very much surprised to hear that it has refused to accept the bargain which has been offered to them by the Prime Minister. I should say that it is not quite so safe to assume that the terms of the compact will be agreed to by this Parliament, as it is to assume that they will be agreed to by the South Australian Parliament. When a person begins to consider the outlook he is obliged to look a few years ahead at the very least. The transfer of the Northern Territory, the construction of the transcontinental railway, the transfer of lighthouses and buoys, the development of the fisheries and the discharge of other new functions have to receive our consideration. It should be remembered that these new functions do not necessarily mean a corresponding financial development. So far, our experience has shown that we may not hope to receive any revenue from any of our ordinary functional departments. What I mean is that the Post and Telegraph Department to-day is spending all it earns, and a little more if a strict account of its expenditure were kept. Take that functional Department which on its spending  side has developed most of all. I rete] to the Department of Defence, and I have to guard myself by alluding only to its spending side. I am afraid that there has been no development on the side of its efficiency. </para>

                                <para>- I will not stop to contest that point, as I am only making an incidental illusion. The only point I was making was that the Department which seems to be developed more than any other, and in which, during the last four years, the expenditure has practically doubled itself, is the one to which we can look for no return. I mean to say that it is all dead expenditure so far as the balance-sheet is concerned. </para>

                                <para>- Precisely. The money may be well spent, but it offers no return or relief to the national balance-sheet. Therefore we have to look to a further drain on our reserves of taxation to meet the constantly expanding functions of the Federal Government.- The matter becomes very serious indeed if we intend to take over the Northern Territory. We shall have to face a deficit of something like £300,000 to begin with, beside the cost of developing the Territory in its earlier years. If we face the question of the transcontinental railway we find that an even larger  expenditure is involved. Right round the development of our Federal functions we are confronted with a huge expenditure without any corresponding revenue. </para>

No man has shown more unbounded ignorance of the functions which he has been set to administer than the honorable gentleman has done during this debate.

Take the figures of the honorable gentleman's own balance-sheet, which shows that this year £io3,°°° is to be returned to the States in excess of their three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue. Out of that sum they must meet the interest on the transferred properties. Therefore, from the point of view of an ordinary honest balance-sheet we have outrun the constable. </para>

                                <para>-That raises quite another question. I am pointing out the present position of affairs. What the States may or may not do is a matter for the year 1910, and is not a matter of immediate concern. Until that year is reached the States will have a right to demand from the Treasurer three-fourths of the total Customs and Excise revenue which hereceives. </para>

                                <para>- I am inclined to think, with the honorable gentleman at the Treasury, that it is very fortunate that that safeguard is contained in the Constitution. Otherwise, the States would not get their three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue very long. The honorable gentleman is constantly gibing at them., but that does not alter the fact that until 1910 they are guaranteed three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue. Even in 1910 the Commonwealth will have to so order its finances that, apart from any constitutional provision or hard-and-fast bond, the States may be well within their reserves in exercising their proper functions. The Minister has pronounced strongly for the termination of the Braddon section, and the taking over of the debts of the States. He assumed that we shall thus obtain more money to spend. </para>

However desirable it may be for the Commonwealth to assume control of the debts of the States, we should be living in a fool's paradise if we were to think that it would necessarily and immediately relieve our finances. </para>

To that criticism the Minister has returned no reply. He assumes that it is correct, and asks "How will it work out?" </para>

                                <para>- My complaint is that the honorable gentleman has put no alternative before the Committee. He seems to be willing to allow the difficulty to solve itself, believing in the essential goodness of things political. But no one should know better than the Minister charged with the financial administration of the Commonwealth that the increase in our revenue is due not merely to the higher rates of duty, but to the fact that we are passing through a period of boom trade; and that should be taken into account in estimating future returns. The financial outlook is strained and menacing, and yet the Minister pass it by as though of no importance, instead of trying to find a way out of our troubles. I do not wish to say more on the subject at the present time. I shall listen with interest to what he has to say in regard to the new protection. If he has a scheme, and I suppose that by this time he has, it will probably be found to be an adaptation of that submitted in outline by the leader of the Labour Party. But I shall be glad to know how the Excise is to be affected. All such schemes must be regarded from the financial point of view, and it is the duty of the Treasurer to deal with them from that stand-point. Instead of doing so, he is content to blunder along without any reliable forecast as to the future returns from the Tariff, allowing honorable members to determine for themselves whether the proposals put before us are based on sound lines, or will lead to financial straits and friction with the States. Friction must inevitably result if we cannot put a satisfactory financial scheme before the authorities of the States. The termination of the Braddon section in  1910  is not far off, and they have a right to complain of the want of breadth and lack of information in the statements of the Treasurer of the day and in his Budget speech. I hope that before we commence to deal with the details of the Tariff the Treasurer will endeavour to show us, in the interests of the States and of Australia, what our financial bearings are, and to what we may look forward with confidence in the immediate future. </para>

                                <para>- The Acting Prime Minister is to be commended for having placed before the Committee a statement showing the reasons which underlie the increase of Federal expenditure. When the honorable member for Flinders was speaking upon the Budget, he was at great pains to show that the expenditure of the Commonwealth has increased, but he was not candid enough to admit that that increase was the result of the Commonwealth policy of constructing public works out of revenue instead of paying for them out of loan funds, as is done by the States. ' When I find honorable members talking of the increase which has taken place in our Federal expenditure, but lacking the candour necessary to show how that increased expenditure has been made up - in short, when I find them attempting to make it appear that the Federation is extravagant - I say that the Acting Prime Minister was perfectly within his rights in following the precedent established by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner, and pointing out that the Treasurers of the States have been exceedingly well treated by the Commonwealth. </para>

                                <para>- There is no obligation upon the Commonwealth - from a constitutional stand-point - to return to the States more than three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue. But, as a matter of fact, we have handed back to them  £5,800,000 in excess of the three-fourths share of the Customs and Excise revenue to which they are entitled. Had the Commonwealth desired to indulge in extravagance, it had plenty of scope to do so. I ask the  deputy  leader of the Opposition how much we have saved the taxpayers of the States in that respect?  If the States had not received £5,800,000 in excess of their share of trie Customs and Excise revenue, they would either have had to increase their taxation, or to borrow money for the purpose of carrying out their public works. </para>

                                <para>- The States have not carried out their portion of the undertaking which was entered into when Federation was established. . When the Constitution Bill was before the electors, its advocates persistently urged that the  establishment  of the Commonwealth would result in a considerable reduction of expenditure by the States. Has any such saving been effected? It is true that a small saving has been made in some of the States Parliaments by reducing the number of members, but I venture to say that £20,000 annually would represent the whole of the economy effected in that connexion. Yet the representatives of the  States, in the' persons of their Premiers, are constantly telling the people that the Commonwealth is extravagant. As a matter of fact, the extravagance is a little nearer home. Had the people ever imagined that the States would continue their huge costly establishments after the inauguration of the Federation they would not have sanctioned the creation of another Parliament. But State expenditure, instead of having decreased, has increased, and no opportunity is lost of endeavouring to discredit the Commonwealth. </para>

                                <para>- I was' not present when the honorable member for Coolgardie spoke, but I do know that there has been a considerable increase of expenditure by the States. It is all very well, for the  deputy  leader of the Opposition - from party, motives - to attempt to discredit the Government. But we must recollect that anything which he may say may be used outside of this House to discredit the Commonwealth. Whilst I differ from the Acting Prime Minister as to the Tariff proposals of the Government, I think that the Opposition should assist the Government to place the plain facts of the position before the people, with a view to showing what is responsible for our increased Federal expenditure. Seeing that our expenditure makes provision for a number of public works which have hitherto been constructed out of loan funds- </para>

                                <para>- I have a few words to  say  with regard to the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> basis of expenditure. When that  system  was introduced in connexion with our public works, I stated that it would work out unfairly. If any honorable member takes the trouble to go through the figures it will be found that mv prediction has been verified- In some of the States we have to pay for the construction of most elaborate and, in some cases, extravagant buildings. But the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> system tends towards extravagance. What inducement is there to keep down expenditure upon public buildings in any one State if it is found that the people of that State have to pay for the construction of expensive buildings in the other States? Glancing through the Estimates, I find that largie sums are set down for post-offices for comparatively small places. </para>

                                <para>- Undoubtedly. The tendency is for the people in a particular' State to endeavour to have elaborate post offices built, because the other States have to find the money. There seems to me to be something radically wrong with these public works Estimates. ' In some cases the expenditure is far too large, whilst in others there is the greatest difficulty in securing an expenditure of £500, £600, or  £1,000  for a post office in a place that is of admitted importance. There is some fault either in regard to the officer in charge of this work or in connexion with the Public Works Department's arrangements in the different States. I understand that in some of the States the recommendations to the Commonwealth Public Works Department go through the hands of States public servants. It is so in South Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Owen</inline> Smyth is the officer under whose control these matters are. I am inclined to think that his recommendations are below the mark in many instances. But at the same time South Australia is charged with her share on account of the more costly works carried out in other States. I would gladly see a return to the old method under which there were inducements to keep within reasonable expenditure in the matter of public works. The Federal system conduces to extravagance and to the erection of elaborate buildings in places where they are not required. </para>

                            <para>.- I have risen chiefly to qualify the effect of some figures given by the Acting Prime Minister. I should like also to mention in connexion with some remarks that have fallen from the honorable member for Grey as to Federal extravagance, that I as a member of this House have never lost an opportunity that has been afforded to me on the public platform of referring to this alleged extravagance in the Administration of the Federal Government. I have always said that it did 'not exist. The only direction in which we can be charged with extravagance is in matters of policy - not in matters of administration ; that is1 to say, in connexion with such matters as the sugar bounties over which, of  course, we have control. I have seen it  stated in the newspapers that some people have complained of increases in the cost of administration, but they were increases in the actual cost of government plus .the cost of our policies such as the sugar bounty, the expenditure on New Guinea, and several other matters. I should also- like to mention that I think the Minister made a mistake to-day in going into a very elaborate explanation of the estimated shrinkage of revenue returns under the Tariff during the first few years. No man in his ordinary senses would say that in eighteen months or two years this Tariff is going to lead to such an increased production that our manufactures will be able to overtake the consumption of the country. Take apparel and textiles. Does any one suppose that the requirements of our population will be compassed by the local, production for some years to come? The figures given by the Tariff Commission, for instance, show that the total imports of woollens amounted to £700,000 in value, while  the total local production was £70,000. Even with all our mills working at full tension, we can easily see that we are not going to add to the local production by £700,000 within two or three years. My belief is that this Tariff will involve taxation upon the masses for some years to come. The only consolation is that a good deal of the money will find its way into the revenue instead of the pockets of the manufacturers. I have a word to say, also, with regard to figures quoted by the Acting Prime Minister from Schooling's statistics, copied from the <inline font-style="italic">British Trade Year-Book</inline> of 1904. I have been unable to obtain a copy of that Blue Book in the library, but it was compiled upon certain statistics given in connexion with the Imperial Conference, those statistics being supplied at the instance of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Balfour.</inline> Picking out seventeen representative exports from the United Kingdom, the statistics showed the percentages of the duties, when expressed in <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> terms, levied by some twenty-eight or thirty countries on those exports. We have first to remember that those seventeen exports were representative exports from the United Kingdom, but were not representative imports of each particular country, and, therefore, from the latter point of view, their significance altogether disappears. It was found that the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> incidence of the duties, specific and <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem,</inline> of the twenty-eight or thirty countries on those goods worked out in such a way that in Russia, which was at the top, the rate was equivalent to 131 per cent., while at the other extreme was Australia, with 6 per cent. But many of those imports, such as coal, were practically prohibited in some countries by the import duties of 100 per cent. and over, while in the case of Australia the representative imports were absolutely free. Honorable members will see at once the fallacy of basing the significance of our Tariff on a comparison with, the Tariffs of other countries in the way here attempted. </para>

                                <para>- Yes; what is shown is the comparative incidence of the Tariff as a whole. I guarantee to pick out a dozen items, and to show that the incidence of our Tariff on English imports is even greater than in the case of Russia. I do not wish to labour the question; but that is the fallacy underlying the statistics picked out by Schooling for the Board of Trade. Let us refer to <inline font-style="italic">Coghlan</inline> to see the true incidence of the Tariff. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coghlan's</inline> last production was in 1903, and it gives the real <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> equivalent of our duties, specific and <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem.</inline> He shows that the average on dutiable goods was 19.10 per cent. Now, I venture to say that the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> equivalent of the duties on dutiable imports - I am not taking the whole range of the imports - is nearer 30 per cent. The Canadian rate is 30 per cent. on all dutiable imports, or, if we add the surtax against Germany, it is 37 per cent. I remember that a few years ago the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rate on all dutiable imports into America was 45 per cent. ; so that, worked out on a true basis, I believe that the incidence of our Tariff is not very much less than the incidence of the Canadian Tariff. I almost apologize for taking advantage of the present opportunity to deal with these matters, but I thought it just as well that the figures placed before us should not go forth without some qualification. </para>

                            <para>. - The honorable member for Grey conveyed to me the impression that in his opinion the expenditure on the proposed transcontinental railway, and in connexion with the taking over of the Northern Territory, should come out of the revenue of the Commonwealth. I know that the honorable member had no desire to convey such an impression, but his argument would lead one to suppose that that was what he thought was in the mind of the  deputy  leader of the Opposition. What the  deputy  leader of the Opposition really referred to was the fact that there must of necessity be a very heavy expenditure on the part of the Commonwealth in connexion with both of these undertakings, inasmuch as there is at the present time a very heavy deficit on the Northern Territory, amounting to any sum up to £300,000 a year. </para>

                                <para>-South Australia has very few assets in the Northern Territory on which to base a claim for compensation. However, as I said before, I do not wish to discuss the question because I feel disgusted with South Australia for her mismanagement of the Northern Territory. I have travelled a little in that part of Australia, and I shall have something to say regarding it at the proper time. At present, I am merely suggesting that the honorable member could not reasonably have had the impression that the necessary money will have to be provided out of revenue. The honorable member lost sight of the fact that there must of necessity be a very heavy loss on both of the undertakings to which I have referred. It is estimated that if the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway be constructed, there must, for a number of years, be a very heavy deficiency, and that, of course, will have to come out of the Commonwealth revenue. If a railway were ever seriously proposed as between Oodnadatta and Pine Creek, another heavy burden would be imposed on the Commonwealth, amounting to <inline font-style="italic">£3,000,000</inline> or £4,000,000. That, I take it, was what was referred to by the honor able member for Parramatta. The Government is charged with incurring a great deal of expenditure; indeed, I think the  deputy  leader of the Opposition said there was a good deal of extravagance. While I believe there is extravagance on the part of the Commonwealth, it is not extravagance of the nature that is charged against the Government by the States authorities. The heavy expenditure disclosed in the Budget papers on account of public works is caused by the large sums unnecessarily devoted to Roma and two or three other places. </para>

                                <para>- It is proposed to spend several thousands of pounds at Roma. In Commonwealth affairs, we should do as is done in the United States, namely, build for the needs of the time, and add to the building as occasion requires. In this connexion, no State has shown a better example than South Australia, where we never find a public building more than is required. Looking through the Estimates, I find that the expenditure on post-offices proposed for South Australia is less than that proposed for any of the other States, although comparing one with another the towns of that State are far more important than some of the towns in other States in which twice the amount of money is proposed to be expended. So I say that the administration of the Department is expensive and extravagant. But, on the other hand, I say that it is false to contend that, as a Parliament, we fritter away Commonwealth funds. We have not done so. The unnecessary expenditure that I hint at is in making provision for increase in business . that may never accrue in the centres named.  In  the carrying out of Commonwealth policy considerable expenditure has been involved. This must of necessity be continued, in pursuance of the policy of the Commonwealth, upon which there has been no division of opinion, in this Parliament. I agree with the honorable member for Grey, that we ought not to take the abuse of States Premiers lying down. They have throughout Australia attempted to lord it over this Parliament. It seems to me that the Government might with some dignity have stood up for the rights of this Parliament. They have, however, knuckled under to the States authorities. </para>

                                <para>- In this matter the late Government was just as bad as the present and previous Commonwealth Governments. They have all knuckled under to the States authorities. The fact that States Premiers travel through the country abusing the Federal Government and Parliament is nothing more than might have been expected, in view of the way in which we have knuckled under to them. We have made the States authorities paramount, instead of giving them notice of what our policy is going to be, in order that they might make due provision when submitting their Budget statements to their respective Parliaments. Instead of adopting that dignified course, we have accepted dictation from them, and have framed our Budget in accordance with their policies. I am of opinion that the States Governments should be given to understand that they must economize. They have in the past received too much money. New South Wales has received millions more than the States authorities had a right to expect. Before the present Administration took office, they spent all they received, to the extent of millions of pounds, and ran into debt to the extent of £350,000. In addition to that, they have frittered away £12,000,000 of borrowed money. The Government of New South Wales is the most extravagant Government in Australia. They have been reared upon extravagance. They have had command of an immense revenue, great credit, and magnificent returns from the lands of the State. The Federal authorities should give them to understand now that they must live within their means, and the Victorian Government should be told the same thing. </para>

                            <para>.- Listening to the criticism of these votes, I have been wondering if it is possible to secure the assistance of honorable members opposite in any attempt to cut down the total of the proposed expenditure, or the expenditure proposed in connexion with any particular item. If not, criticism of the votes is not worth very much. I do not care to undertake the duty of saying what amount may properly be expended on a particular post-office. No private member is in a position to do that. But I should certainly be prepared to support reasonable reductions, and in the case of one or two items, to which I might refer, I should be prepared to suggest an increase in the votes proposed. I do not believe that Commonwealth expenditure on buildings is generally extravagant, but I point out that the expenditure on post-offices and other Commonwealth buildings is much greater in some States than that proposed in others for doing practically the same work. As this expenditure is now debited to all the States on the per capita basis, it is right that it should be harmonized. I do not for a moment suggest the parochial view that the amount of expenditure should be the same in each State, but that, having due regard to the higher price of materials and wages in one locality as compared with another, we should expect to be able to do about the same work for the same money in one State as in another. It is proposed to expend a sum of £3,000 on a post-office at Roma, a place with only some 2,300 people. There is only a very small staff there. </para>

                                <para>- Roma is in Queensland. It is an important town. There are a couple of artesian bores there, and also a bore which produces natural gas, by which the town is lighted. I am rather well up in the history of .Roma, its geographical position, its potentialities and possibilities, but I cannot for the life of me see why we should have a post-office there costing £3,000, whilst at other places, as, for instance, at Port Pirie, where there is a very much larger population, and a much greater volume of business, £1,500 is considered quite sufficient for a post-office. The post-offices required for some places in Western Australia would appear to be designed on the most lavish scale, judging by the amount set down for them. For instance, £2,900 is set down for a post-office at Northam, which, although the centre of an agricultural district, is but a very small town. </para>

                                <para>- When we ad.journed for dinner I was pointing out that it was difficult to arrive at the basis of the proposed expenditure on new works and buildings. In some towns the population of which is very small, the Commonwealth, appears to be prepared to expend far more on its public services than in other towns of greater importance, and boasting a much larger population. I cited the proposed expenditure of £3,000 on a post office at Roma, and the Minister of Trade and Customs referred, by  way  of interjection, to a proposed expenditure in connexion with the Unley post office. I am rather pleased that he did so, since his interjection gives point to my remarks. After some agitation, the ' Government have placed on the Estimates something like £200 to provide additional postal facilities at Unley, a South Australian municipality comprising a population of 20,000. For that expenditure additions will be made to the post office there, the total cost of which was considerably under £1,000. The necessary provision for a fairly large staff will be made, and the people will be satisfied ; yet in other towns, with a mere handful of people, very large sums are to-be expended. </para>

I should think that there is already a post office at Cloncurry, and that in many cases where* a large sum is to be expended in 'the erection of new buildings comparatively small expenditure on additions would be sufficient. We ought not to be constantly spending 011 new postal buildings all over the Commonwealth much larger sums than appear to be justifiable. Certainly an expenditure of £3,000 on a new post office at Roma, and of £2,900 on a new post office at Northam require some explanation. </para>

                                <para>- And the amount proposed to be expended on the post office there is an important item. I notice some striking disparities between the amounts proposed to be voted for the erection of drill rooms. One would imagine that such buildings would be much the same all over Australia. For the most part they are built of  weatherboards  and galvanized iron. In some towns drill rooms have been erected at a cost of .£200 or £300, whilst in much smaller ones they have cost up to £1,000. I should like to know the basis of the allocation of this expenditure. When in the early days of the Commonwealth each State was debited with the expenditure incurred in it by the Commonwealth, the Government of Queensland specially requested the Federal Ministry not to incur any expenditure in that State unless it was absolutely necessary. One or  two other States made a like request ; but since the Commonwealth expenditure has been dealt with on a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> basis we have had no such appeals. On the contrary, the constant desire of these States is that we should spend as much as possible on new works and buildings. </para>

We have either adopted the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> system of distribution of the expenditure too soon or we ought to extend that system to the distribution, of revenue. I recognise that in the latter contingency it would be necessary to have special consideration for Western Australian conditions. </para>

I wish to be sure that real economy is being practised. I speak from some little' experience, gained during the short while that I was Minister of Home Affairs.

                                <para>- If that is obstructing progress, I did. I cut the Estimates down as far as I was able. I am a great deal more concerned about the people of Australia having old-age pensions at the earliest possible opportunity than elaborate buildings. I notice that the Treasurer has included a provision for .£250,000 for harbor and coastal defences. An amount of £125,950, which it is anticipated may not be expended during the year, is deducted from the total of .£342,000, leaving a sum of £21.6,050 udder the "Special Defence" provision. I presume that  unless  some scheme is placed definitely before Parliament, the Government will not ask the Committee to pass that item. I would not pass any such huge vote without knowing precisely what was to be done with it. The Committee will require to know before it passes this large vote, which one may assume involves some new scheme,  precisely what that scheme is. I shall not vote for any such proposals unless we know what we are doing. </para>

If he knows anything at all about the finances of the country, surely it was not too much to expect him to lay before the Committee, not only a complete statement of the actual condition of the finances at the present time, but also an indication of the policy of the Government with regard to future financial provisions which must be made to meet the readjustment which is imperative on the expiration of the Braddon period in 1910. </para>

                                <para>- Certainly not, but every careful and prudent administrator of finance will not only have regard to the immediate necessities of the present, but look ahead a little, . and see that, whilst immediate financial exigencies are met, suitable 'provision, is also made against' getting into deep financial waters in the future. If the Treasurer had any proper sense of his responsibilities to this House, and to the country, he would have gone into the matter in a very much more careful and business-like way than he appears to have done. My own impression is that he knows nothing at all about the matter, and that he has not got the information. The Budget speech he recently delivered is the poorest that ever came from any Treasurer in any Parliament - State or Commonwealth. All he seemed to do was to lay before the Committee the figures which had been compiled by his officers, without apparently having any practical knowledge of their application to the general affairs of the Commonwealth. He appeared to know absolutely nothing at all about the general condition of the finances, and he certainly did nothing in the direction of indicating what was to be the financial policy of the Government for the immediate future. I have taken occasion before, when speaking on the Budget, to, object to the practice, whilst we see in the future a certainty of our financial responsibilities increasing by leaps and bounds, of" handing over to the States a sum over and above the three-fourths of the Customs and* Excise revenue which, under the Constitution, we are obliged to return to them . I shall quote what I said when speaking on the Budget last year. I hold the same view now. As reported on page 2489 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> of last year, I said - </para>

                            <para>Treasurer has admitted that it cannot continue, and he has pointed out that in the near future we are likely to incur increased obligations. I say that we ought to conserve our funds for contingencies of that kind. Whilst we have the opportunity we ought to make provision to meet these prospective increases, and, possibly, some unforeseen expenditure. Instead of doing that, we have been handing over these balances to the States, with the result that some of them are able to point in their financial statements to surpluses. I have always maintained that a surplus of revenue in the hands of a Treasurer is more indefensible than is a deficit. </para>

                        <para>The right honorable member for Swan was then Treasurer. He certainly gave a much more explicit and comprehensive Budget speech than we have had on the present occasion. He knew what he was talking about, and that is more than I can give the present Treasurer credit for. We have paid to the States, over and above the amount which we had a constitutional obligation to pay, a total of £5,728,114. At the same time, although our expenses have not been very great up to the present stage of the existence of the Commonwealth, there are impending in the immediate future a number of liabilities which we must face, and for which we must make financial provision. The Treasurer has made no attempt to make provision for those liabilities. These will include the expenditure on the Federal Capital. No one, of course, can estimate how much that is likely to be. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable gentleman might set me an example. I have not yet heard him put that- ; advice into practice. It is also proposed to sacrifice ,£117,000 of the revenue of the Post and Telegraph Department in order to establish penny postage throughout the Commonwealth. Then we _ have to face the question of defence, which in the near future must involve a very large expenditure. Other questions to be considered are the transfer of the States debts, the construction of transcontinental railways, and the erection of necessary lighthouses which the ex-Treasurer in his last Budget estimated would cost from £150,000 to £200,000. No account of those questions seems to have been taken by the present Treasurer, and I hope that even now it is not too late for him to indicate the views of the Government. </para>

Last year we returned to the States ,£805,000 in excess of their three-fourths share of the Customs and Excise revenue. The total amount paid by the Commonwealth in that year was - to New South Wales, £2,361,846; to Victoria, £1,518,670 ; to Queensland, £61,519; to South Australia, £527,463; and to Tasmania, £158,706.

                                <para>- The money might' well have been used in that direction, or in other legitimate ways, instead of being returned to the States. I agree with the honorable member for Boothby that there should be considerable curtailment of some items on the Estimates before the . Committee. Attention has already been called to the large amounts which are proposed for a number of post-offices. I do not intend to refer to those items in detail at the present time, but I cannot help being struck with the fact that large sums are set down for post-offices in the back-blocks, where there is apparently only a very limited population. Although the population in those places may be numbered almost by the dozen, yet the pro-  posed expenditure on post-offices runs into a very large sum. I miss one item from the Estimates. </para>

                                <para>- Not in this case, because the district is extremely populous, and the amount is very small. I am not asking for a penny to be spent . in the construction of a new post-office in any part of my electorate, but it has been represented by the municipality of Rockdale - one of the most populous portions of the electorate- that it has a post-office in which the accommodation for the public is only about 8 feet square. In that space, the postal officials have not only to transact ordinary postal and telegraphic business, but also to pay old-age pensions. Honorable members can easily imagine the congestion which must take place on a counter only 6 feet long and in a space about 8 feet square. A report was called for, and some alterations were approved, but on these Estimates I do not see any provision made for the purpose. Perhaps the Treasurer can tell us whether provision is made in the Estimates-in-Chief.' I understand that the sum required to make the alterations, which are imperatively necessary, is less than £200. </para>

Generally speaking, honorable members are not desirous of unnecessarily curtailing proposals for expenditure in connexion with the Post and Telegraph Department, but they should exercise discretion in regard to such as on their face seem excessive.

We must, however, know the general policy of the Government before voting large sums of money for defence purposes. The Acting Prime Minister has been asked to explain the items to which I am drawing attention, but he has refraine'd from doing so, on the plea that the Prime Minister wishes to deal with the matter personally, and he does not desire to anticipate anything that he might say. It would, therefore, be only fair to ask him to postpone the items until we have received the Prime Minister's explanation. </para>

                                <para>- I  shall  be very much surprised if the Committee votes for these items in the absence of an explanation of a satisfactory character in regard to them. I understand that the Tariff debate has been interrupted to allow of the consideration of these Estimates, because it is urgent that provision should be made for new works. However sound that reason may be so far as it applies to perhaps most' of the items, it does not apply to the items to which I have called special attention. There is no urgency so far as they are concerned, and I submit that they might well be postponed until information "has been supplied to honorable members as to the purpose of the proposed expenditure, and the general policy of the Government in regard to naval defence. I do not wish to detain the Committee longer now; but when the items are being considered in detail, honorable members will, no doubt, feel it advisable to considerably curtail some of the proposed expenditure. </para>

                            <para>.- I do not think that honorable members desire to prolong the discussion of these Estimates. For the most part they provide for necessary works, upon whose construction we should enter at the earliest possible moment, and I shall, therefore, assist the  Government in passing them, reserving to myself the right to ask for information in regard to individual items. Items  about  which I desire information are those in division 8, where £216,050 is proposed to be expended, under the heading of " New special defence provision. 1 ' I have no doubt that "the Minister of Defence, or in his absence some other Minister, will be able to make a full explanation of those proposals. </para>

                                <para>- I do not know that, the Estimates could well be passed without them. Ministers are not likely to ask us to vote for proposals which they have not fully considered, and in regard to which they are not able to give us full information. But I should not have risen to make these observations had I not wished to refer to one or two matters to which I think it is necessary that I should direct attention. The first of these has reference to the financial relations of the States to the Commonwealth. For some reason or other, the Acting Prime Minister and -myself appear to have got at loggerheads in regard to what was the intention of the Deakin Government in this connexion. There ought to <inline font-style="italic">be</inline> no difference whatever upon this question. However, an impression appears to have got abroad - an impression which has been created by the interjections of the Acting Prime Minister - that I did something at the Brisbane Conference of Premiers which I was not authorized to do. I venture to think that the Acting Prime Minister has not given that attention to this subject which I have devoted to it, and consequently is not quite so fully versed in all its details. To-night, he seems to think that there is really no difference of opinion between us. I am rejoiced to hear that that is so. In speaking this afternoon, the honorable gentleman quoted a statement which was made by the Prime Minister at the Melbourne Conference of Premiers - a statement which I quoted at the Brisbane Conference. I told the Pre,miers there that - </para>

But I would point out that there is no necessity to ask the States for permission to take over their debts. Under the Constitution we have full power ' to take over £202,000,000 of their "debts - that is the amount of the debts in existence at the time of the consummation of Federation - and I have always advocated the adoption of that course, although I have no objection to taking over the whole of the debts. </para>

                                <para>- But if we took over the whole of the debts existing now, they would not always represent the whole. There is no reason why this Parliament should not take over the £202,000,000 of the public debts of the States at any time that it chooses to pass the necessary legislation. It has full power to do so under the Constitution. Upon a previous occasion I said that the Acting Prime Minister had declared that he would not accept the proposals which I put before the States Premiers at Brisbane. If he meant that he could not accept the two proposals separately I accept his explanation. </para>

                                <para>- My opinion is that it is not impossible to do the one without the other. If we do not choose to take over the debts we need not do so. The Constitution provides that we "may" take them over; it does not say that we "shall." It is not compulsory upon us to do so. It is solely in the interests of the whole Australian people that we should take over the debts. The Commonwealth Treasury will not gain a farthing by it. The profits will go into the coffers of the States Governments, and the people will probably in the end save£20,000,000. That is the reason why we should be anxious to see the debts taken over by the Commonwealth. As to the matter of the amount to be returned to the States, the Constitution provides that at the expiration of the Braddon section the Customs and Excise revenue may be retained by the Commonwealth for the purpose of paying interest on the debts of the States. </para>

                                <para>- But the States require the money very much, to enable them to carry out their obligations. It must be remembered that the people of the States and those of the Commonwealth are all one people. The revenue of the States and the revenue of the Commonwealth belong to the same taxpayers, and whatever we do in relation to the debts will benefit the same people. The£800,000 which we are now going to vote will not, so far as the people of Australia are concerned, be as though it were thrown into the sea. It will benefit each State in which it is expended just in the same way as the expenditure of money voted by the Parliament of Victoria benefits the people of this State. </para>

                                <para>- I do not think that there has been any Federal extravagance. I have not seen any. If we have at any time spent money a little more freely than we might have done, we had it to spend, but I am quite certain that no money has been' spent by the Federal Government, whilst I have had anything to do with it, that has not been necessary, and that has not been carefully spent. </para>

Again, I went on to say that the proposals submitted at Brisbane in regard to our financial relations with the States were exactly the same as those submitted by me in the last Parliament. I was twitted by my honorable friend, the Acting Prime Minister, that I had shown a leaning towards my own State. Well, I shall certainly never try to do an injustice to my own State, but I hope I shall never do a good turn to my own State at the expense of another. </para>

                                <para>- It can be carried out as easily as possible if it is thought desirable to do so. There is really no difference between the Prime Minister and myself in regard to this matter. Indeed, there cannot be; and if the Acting Prime Minister will only consult the Prime Minister, and will look at the instructions which I received, and which the Prime Minister is in a position to give him, he will ascertain that I acted with full consideration to the Prime Minister, as it was my duty to do; that I carried out his wishes and instructions to the letter; and that the arrangements we made at Brisbane were no other than those which he had approve  j  of, and upon -which he congratulated me on his return. There is another matter to which I wish to refer. I am sorry the honorable member for Coolgardie is not in his place. I have not given him notice, but I shall have something to say about him. </para>

                                <para>- I desire to say something in regard to the observations made last week by the honorable member concerning my action as a. Minister in the Barton Government. The incidents to which he referred occurred five years ago, when the Tariff was under consideration. I am glad to see that the honorable member is now in his place. I may preface my observations by saying that they are made ' ' more in sorrow than in anger."  His  remarks  about me were to the effect that I was an. inconsistent person., because when the Tariff was under consideration I threw both my judgment and my integrity to the winds. I do not know what object the honorable member had in view in attacking me, seeing that I have not yet given a' vote upon the Tariff and have merely expressed myself in general terms as being not anxious to be more protective than those members of the Tariff Commission who were protectionist in their views. The  Chairman"  of the Tariff Commission was the honorable member for Bendigo. One would think that even active protectionists would agree that if one was generally in accord with the protectionist side of a Commission that sat two or three years investigating the Tariff, one  could not be very far from being a protectionist. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member for Coolgardie, who is a freetrader, sunk his fiscalism for party purposes, there being no fiscal policy in the party to which he belongs. He seemed to think that there might be a chance of my voting with him if there were a division; but he was very anxious to show the people of Australia that the person who was likely to help him to carry out views which he believed would benefit his constituents, was one who ought to be " shown up" as thoroughly inconsistent. That is certainly an unusual plan, because, as a rule, we are glad to get support wherever we can. </para>

                                <para>-A charge of inconsistency has been made against me, and I do not desire to deal with the Tariff, but with the inconsistency of the honorable member who made the charge. The inconsistency of the honorable member was not on the Tariff question, and I do not think I shall have occasion to refer to the Tariff again. I am charged with inconsistency, because, while a member of the Barton Government, five years ago, I voted with my colleagues on some- of the items of the Tariff then under discussion. </para>

                                <para>- I voted with my colleagues five years ago; and it is  represented  that I am more moderate in my views now that I am without any ministerial obligation. The whole charge is based on an assumption as to what I am going to do in regard to the Tariff. As a matter of fact, I have not as yet done anything, and, perhaps, it would have been wiser for the honorable member for Coolgardie to have waited a little before launching his invective. The honorable member, in the course of his speech, said that his remarks in reference to myself were all for my own good, and that he was sorry to have to make them. But I do not take the honorable member's remarks in that way, because I regard them not only as not for my good, but as absolutely unnecessary. I am sure that the honorable member and myself will not be any worse friends when this affair between us is over; but I have to. say to him that those who live in glass houses ought not to throw stones. I shall relate something that occurred not five years ago, but three years ago, with which the honorable member  was  intimately associated. On the 21st April, 1904, the present Acting Prime Minister, then being a member of the Government, and also the honorable member for Darling Downs, who was a Ministerial supporter, voted against the inclusion of State employes within the operation of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, which was a Government measure. When I am charged with inconsistency by supporters of the present Government I shall show that if I were inconsistent, others were more inconsistent. I merely gave a vote on an item in the Tariff, but I shall show that there were those who voted on a principle - a great principle - and afterwards reversed their votes. I shall show that the honorable member for Coolgardie, on a principle on which he was pledged to his constituents and to Australia, changed his vote. The honorable member knows what I am talking about. However, at present I am dealing with the Acting Prime Minister. </para>

                                <para>- On that question the Government went out of office. We, the members of the Government, stuck to our guns, and resigned as a matter of principle. We felt that the Commonwealth had no right to interfere with State servants - that it would be an interference with the financial arrangements of the States, and altogether wrong. When we resigned, the honorable member for South Sydney and his. colleagues took office, the honorable member for Coolgardie becoming Postmaster-General, and the present Acting <inline font-weight="bold">Chairman (Mr. Batchelor)</inline> Minister of Home Affairs. What happened is all set out in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and the records of the House. Forty days afterwards, on the 1st June, the present Acting Prime Minister, and also the present Attorney-General, voted for the inclusion of railway servants within the operation of the Bill. If the honorable member for Coolgardie was so anxious to purify the House, why did he not level his invective against those who were involved in that change of front ? Why did he not devote his attention to those gentlemen instead of to me ? I represent the same State as he himself does, and have never done  him any harm of which I am aware. I have worked, as he has done, for the good of Western Australia, and Australia; and I have never mentioned his name, or the name of any other representative from my State, unless to resent personal attacks. </para>

                                <para>- It was his duty to do so if he was desirous of purifying public life. Why should he attack me now that I have resigned office, and sit in the cold shades of opposition? At any rate, I did not act like the Acting Prime Minister when, on a recent occasion, it would have been in my interests to vote in a certain direction. I am bound by my election pledges; and I have shown no feeling whatever, to honorable members opposite. With those honorable members I have no personal quarrel ; and I hope they are as good friends with me now as they were before I resigned office. I should like to ask what the honorable member for Coolgardie and the other members of the Labour Party did on the same occasion? Those who accuse others of inconsistency should at least be consistent themselves. Those who accuse others of impurity should themselves be pure. Let me tell the honorable member what he and his party did. On the same occasion, the 21st April, 1904, the honorable member for Coolgardie, with the Labour Party in a body, voted in favour of including railway and other public servants in the Arbitration Bill, and in doing so turned out the Deakin Government because they would not agree to that proposal, and stepped into their_ shoes. </para>

                                <para>- No, I have not been sorry. There are some considerations of more importance than continuance of office. Some people refer to office as if it were everything, but I do not care a snap of the finger for office unless it gives me peace of mind and satisfaction. On the 21st April, 1904, the honorable member for Coolgardie and the other members of the Labour Party turned the Deakin-  Government out of office and secured office for themselves. They were assisted at the time by some of the members of the Deakin party, who voted against their leader. The present Postmaster-General was one of those who deserted his leader at the time and voted. against the Government. They insisted on turning us out, and I hope they are proud of their action, for they reversed that vote immediately afterwards. The present Postmaster-General, after assisting to turn the Deakin Government out of office, reversed his vote forty days afterwards. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member deserted the party to which he belonged. On the 1 st Tune, forty days after the vote to which I have referred, the honorable member for Coolgardie, in common with other members of the Labour Party, voted to exclude civil servants from the Arbitration Bill. They had pledged themselves in connexion with the. matter in the various electorates throughout the country, and the Bill was ' being considered just after an election. They had stated that they were in favour of the inclusion of" civil servants in the Federal Arbitration Act. The honorable member for Coolgardie was amongst those who gave that pledge, and if he now contends that he did" not so pledge himself let him say so. I say that in Western Australia the honorable member did pledge himself, as did' other members of the party appealing to&gt; the electors in that State, in favour of the. inclusion of the civil servants in the Federal Arbitration Bill. The fact remains that  they  pledged themselves to the electors, and?  they were fresh from the country when we were considering the Federal Arbitration Bill. Why did they change their views? One might at least suppose that a great party like the Labour Party, and a man like the honorable member for Coolgardie, after turning out a Government by a certain vote, and thus securing an important position, would, at any rate, stick to their colours. But forty days afterwards they changed their votes, threw the civil servants to the winds, and included only the railway servants, leaving all others out of the Bill. </para>

                                <para>- What did it matter? A pledge had been given by honorable members before they entered the House. They considered that pledge so sacred that they could not escape its consequences ; that, notwithstanding the love and affection they professed for the Prime Minister - though I do not know that they had so much for his colleagues - they must turn him out and step into his shoes. Forty days' experience of office seems to have tempered the honorable member for Coolgardie and the party to which he belongs, because they then reversed the vote which they had previously given and allowed the civil servants to go to Jericho. I make this statement " more in sorrow than in anger." I notice that the honorable member for Corio is not present, but, on looking up the matter this morning, I found that he was a consistent supporter of the inclusion of the employés of the States Governments in the Arbitration Bill. He was pledged to his constituents, and he voted against the Government. Although he had previously supported them, like the present Postmaster-General, he took part in turning them out of office on that occasion. He was not at all satisfied, and at page 1835of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> for the 1st June, 1904, the honorable member stated the matter so clearly and fairly, that I take the liberty of quoting him, his statement is so <inline font-style="italic">apropos</inline> of the whole case. The honorable member said - </para>

I trust that honorable members will exhibit their strong disapproval of the inconsistent attitude of the Government by refusing to sit behind them when they decline to carry out the pledges upon which they succeeded to office. </para>

                                <para>- I say that the honorable members of that party hope to obtain advantages by keeping the present Government in office. Their object is to secure power and obtain advantages by  keeping in office a party without whom they could not obtain those advantages. The great Labour Party of Australia, of which we hear so much, is bowing its head to a party half its strength to gain that which it could not otherwise obtain. </para>

                                <para>- There are no sour grapes about this. The honorable member may criticise' me, but he must do so in courteous terms. I could' well understand the Labour Party supporting a Government whose party is smaller than their own if there were any great bond of union or of respect between the two. But we know that the contrary is the case so far as the Labour Party and the present Administration are concerned. The Prime Minister, in unmistakable terms, has told the Labour Party over and over again what he thinks of their organization and their methods, yet we find them bowing their heads and giving him support. </para>

I cannot say that the Prime Minister was referring to' the present state of the finances at that time, but the fact of the Labour Party being a political machine 'has a direct bearing on finance, which is the foundation of every business that we transact in this House. He was showing that, in regard to their votes and actions on finance and other questions, the Labour Party was a political machine, that its members acted as one man, and did not vote on the principle followed by most parties, of which some members vote one way and some another. He said that they voted as a machine, and described what he meant by a machine. He said - </para>

                                <para>- I am going; to obey the Chairman's ruling. I should like to point out to the honorable member for Coolgardie, who isa supporter of the Government in its financial proposals and every other proposal, and whose idea is to keep them in office at the present time - 'without the support of the party to which the honorable member belongs the Government could not remain in office - that what I have quoted is an expression of the opinion held by the Prime Minister in regard to them. The Prime Minister is a man well known in this country. He is an upright, honorable man. He has not asked for the support of that party to carry on the affairs of the Government or to direct the finances. But the party have determined, without being asked, to keep the Prime Minister in office with the object, no doubt, of governing the country through him.. It is not for his good, but for their advantage, that they do so. It is not because they love him, for I believe they will bring him to political ruin ;. but it is because they want to obtain from the Government what they cannot otherwise obtain. I am very sorry that I should have incurred your displeasure, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> or overstepped the mark. I assure you that I was not aware that I was not quite within my rights. I bow to your decision .. I should not have said a word of the foregoing but for the uncalled-for attack which was made -on me last week - an attack which was said to be made " more in sorrow than in anger," but which was still very severe. I want to remind the honorable member- for Coolgardie that I am a Scotsman, and that my motto is <inline font-style="italic">Nemo me impune lacessit</inline></para>

                            <para>.- I hope I shall be able to discuss the subject of finance without either citing Latin quotations or losing my temper. The right honorable member for Swan has been very severe to-night in resenting what he is pleased to consider an attack upon himself. He attacked the Labour Party because he imagines that, in some way,, it controls the Government, and in that manner is responsible for the state of the finances. That may  be true in a sense. But as other combinations are possible which would deprive the Labour Party of its paramount power, I do not see why the right honorable gentleman should not arrange for a combination of that kind. </para>

I well remember a time here when, without any provocation, he led a furious onslaught upon me personally. </para>

                                <para>- There was no proximate cause whatever. The right honorable member's statement was made in this House in 1905. He seems to think that because I happen to come from the same State as he does I should not draw attention to his inconsistencies, and to the fact that the position which he took up when the former Tariff was under consideration here is grossly inconsistent with the position which he takes up to-day. I shall not refer to the Tariff, sir, except incidentally. In the attack which he made to-night, the right honorable member attempted to get over the fact that he now denounces a 25 per cent. duty on mining machinery when, a few years ago, he voted for a similar duty thereon. He seems to think that I ought to speak of him in the House with " bated breath and whisp'ring humbleness." I do not know why he should hold such an expectation. I owe him nothing. During the many years he was in power in Western Australia I never had a favour from him. Indeed, the, only thing I owe him and his party is bitter persecution. Since he has been a Commonwealth Minister he has not done, nor has he had the opportunity of doing, anything for me. I have always respected the right honorable gentleman for the great services which he has rendered as an explorer and a politician. But when he rises here and attempts to say that I have no right even to criticise him. in any way- </para>

                                <para>- I notice that since leaving the Government the right honorable gentleman spends most of his time in making explanations. It is a most remarkable thing that at nearly every sitting some statement in a newspaper, or by an honorable member, requires correction at his hands. The necessity of making these repeated corrections shows the deplorable position into which the right honorable gentleman has drifted. I would like to reply at length to the right honorable gentleman, sir, but in view of the ruling which you gave after you resumed the chair; I do not think that I should be in order in going into the matters which I had intended to do. I shall take advantage of another opportunity when, without transgressing the rules of the House, an effective answer may be given to some of the baseless charges which the honorable member has uttered to-night. </para>

I desire to get back to the real question before the Committee. To-night, under cover of obtaining Supply, the Treasurer has given practically a second edition of his Budget. </para>

                                <para>- I stand .here with no personal grievance, or desire to work up a struggle between the honorable gentleman and myself ; though probably we shall have one before I have concluded my remarks. Very often it indicates weakness in debate not to have a personal grievance, so as to hold the close attention of those whom one is attacking. . This afternoon the Treasurer shovelled out a number of figures - that is all it can be called - and I interjected that he was then using Professor Allen's figures. I meant <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Allen,</inline> Secretary to the Treasury. The Acting Prime Minister certainly ought to go to that officer for his figures, but he ought to rely upon himself for the application of the figures. I protest against any Treasurer making use of a departmental statement as his own statement. Of course, I do not expect a busy man such as the Acting Prime Minister is to-day to be able to talk of the finances in a poetic manner to the Committee.  But I do complain of the verbiage of a Treasury officer's explanation and application of the figures - because apparently the document was read - being addressed to honorable members. I look to the honorable gentleman as a responsible Minister to' apply the figures with which he has been furnished by the Department whenever he is delivering 'a Budget. Afterwards the honorable member' for  Parramatta, without any preparation, made a very critical examination of the statement of the Treasurer, who was asked a question in regard to a forecast. That apparently is the trouble. Within a few days we shall be asked to deal with the Tariff, when we do not know the exact financial position of the Commonwealth. </para>

                                <para>- That is the burden of the complaint against the honorable gentleman. The honorable member for Parramatta and those who think with him are justified in opposing a Tariff which is to impose heavy burdens upon the people until they know the financial condition . of the Commonwealth. That exposition has not yet been given. I am one of those who care nothing for a forecast. The Acting . Prime Minister is to be complimented upon his cautiousness in refusing to give a forecast of the probable result of the Tariff. The first Commonwealth Treasurer, the Right Honorable <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner, a very able1 man and a capable Minister, skilled in accountancy and equipped with all the information in his Department, estimated that under normal conditions the Kingston Tariff, after it had been in operation for four years, would not return more than £5,000,000 per annum. But from that day to this, the revenue of the Commonwealth has always beer* about ,£9,000,000 per annum. So much for forecasts.' The statement that only £5&gt;000&gt;000 per annum would be collected from Customs and Excise duties was the glided  pill which the people of Australia were induced to swallow when they accepted! the Kingston Tariff. But they have actually been required to contribute nearly/ £9,000,000 a year. The Treasurer estimates the increase in revenue for the current year at £.1,000,000. </para>

                                <para>- That may appear from the figures which the honorable gentleman will shovel into <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> But, replying to the honorable member for Parramatta, he said that if the rates of duties were reduced he was afraid that he would not obtain the increase which he had estimated. But while during the six weeks prior to the introduction of this Tariff there was an enormous clearance of tobacco, spirits, and other highly dutiable goods, the stocks then imported will shortly be exhausted, and two months hence the clearances will' be much larger than they are to-da.y. We may reasonably anticipate a return of probably £10,000,000 a year for the next -four or five years, because, even if the Tariff is effective in establishing industries, it will be quite as long as that before our importations are seriously affected. Even the most ardent protectionist cannot think that the Tariff will have its full effect in a year or two. At the present time, the difficulty of manufacturers is to obtain a sufficient number of suitable employes to keep their establishments in full work, and it will take at least four or five years to establish all the industries which the Treasurer, a thorough-going protectionist, wishes to establish. I do not know why he gave us a second edition of the Budget speech this afternoon, unless it was to attack the Treasurers of the States. </para>

                                <para>- The Commonwealth returns to them large sums, which they expend. This Parliament has to bear the opprobrium and unpopularity of imposing taxation, but it does not control the expenditure of the money collected. The Treasurer tells us that millions of pounds have been poured into the Treasuries of the States, more money having been returned to New South Wales than to any other State.He apparently desires that the impression shall be created that the money which is not needed for Commonwealth purposes is returned to the people from whom it has been collected. That is not so. They have not received a penny of it. They have had to pay the duties which we have imposed, and the money has gone into the Commonwealth Treasury. But in returning part of it to the Treasurers of the States we have not returned it into the pockets of those from whom we took it. The Commonwealth Government will always remain unpopular while the present financial arrangement exists, while the States Treasurers will enjoy the fleeting popularity of spendthrifts, who are always more popular than economical persons are. I do not believe in taking from the people £1 more than is necessary for the purposes of government, and the drawback to the present system is that millions of pounds are unjustly taken from the people by the Commonwealth, and what is not required for Commonwealth purposes is returned to the Treasurers of the States, who, instead of reducing the burden of State taxation, may squander the money to make themselves popular with their supporters. The Premier of New South Wales has recently made some very serious attacks upon the Commonwealth Parliament. To-day the electors of that State realize that they are paying heavier taxation than they have ever been called upon to pay previously. That is the only fact which is brought closely home to them. They do not realize that the Commonwealth has returned to New South Wales millions sterling in excess of the three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue to which she was constitutionally entitled. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers</inline> has gained great popularity by suggesting the repeal of the income tax and the reduction of State taxation. </para>

                                <para>- The States Treasurers naturally say that if the return of a fixed annual sum is not guaranteed to them they will soon be in an insolvent position. Of course, the Customs and Excise Departments form the most prolific source of revenue in Australia. The States Treasurers fully realize that if the Braddon section be discontinued - if the return of a certain sum is not guaranteed to them each year - they will never know what is the condition of their finances. The reason why the Acting Prime Minister desires the enactment of a Tariff which will produce a large revenue is that the smaller States may be maintained in a solvent position. I have long waited for the formulation of some scheme which, whilst permitting of the imposition of the' lowest possible amount of taxation upon the people, would insure the annual return to the States of a sum sufficient to preserve their solvency. All the trouble which we are now experiencing is due to the introduction of the new Tariff. </para>

If that idea had been adhered to by the Ministry, the present trouble would not have been experienced.

                                <para>- The Estimates submitted by the Acting Prime Minister for additions, new works and buildings, contain provision for the expenditure of a large sum upon defence matters. Some honorable members have asked why we should sanction expenditure upon these works without knowing the defence policy of the Government. That is a very pertinent question to ask. If we vote an enormous sum of money in this connexion without being informed of the defence policy of the Government we shall be surrendering our control of the finances of the Commonwealth. I have always urged that that control represents the greatest power with which honorable members are invested. Only a short time ago we granted the Government four months' Supply. </para>

                                <para>- I know that the honorable gentleman is the hardest-handed man in the Government. He can retain office longer than can anybody else. When once he gets his claw upon a portfolio he never relinquishes his hold until he is absolutely compelled to do so. I repeat that either these Defence Estimates ought or ought not to be canvassed. ' Of course,  any  honorable member who is satisfied with the Government may say, "I will act blindly in this matter and vote the full amount which is asked." As a representative of the people I am not prepared to adopt that course. L objected to granting "the Government Supply, because I did not like either their Tariff proposals or the statements contained in the Budget. I am glad that we have awakened from our lethargic sleep upon defence matters. We should certainly recognise the necessity for securing a more efficient defence system, and it is idle to deny that such a system will involve us in a large expenditure. But to ask to sanction the expenditure of an enormous sum of  money  without knowing the defence policy of the  Government is absurd. It appears to me that it is the bounden duty of a representative man to be most watchful in regard to the finances. No matter whether a Protectionist, a Labour, or a Free-trade Ministry is in power, if we allow the Government to control the finances unchecked, or permit a Treasurer to do what the Acting Prime Minister has done to-night - make a financial statement which is really that of a departmental officer - we virtually surrender all sound control over the finances of the country. I am speaking in no partisan spirit. Of course, I am well aware that when Works and Buildings Estimates are thrown down upon the table the argument in favour of passing them can be put in a very seductive way. The Ministry have simply to ask, " Are you going to suspend operations in regard to these works, and so prevent us from employing hundreds of men " ? But that is no' reason why we should surrender our power of just criticism. The honorable member for Parramatta made to-night one of the best and clearest speeches I have ever heard from him, in regard to the financial situation. As a representative man in this Chamber, I feel that I am put to a disadvantage when a State Premier is permitted to slander or besmirch the position which I occupy. The Premier of New South Wales has placed the Commonwealth Parliament in an unfair position before the  people of that State. But if we surrender our duty of analytical examination of the finances, we give opportunities for men like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers</inline> to criticise us. It is our neglect of the duty of superintending the finances in a proper manner which affords scope for the States Premiers and other State politicians to make points at our expense. The position, so far as the people of New South Wales are concerned, is this : They feel the enormous taxation that is taken out of their pockets by means of Customs and Excise duties. In the pre-Federation days, New South Wales had the good fortune of being the most lightly taxed country in the world. Certainly, it was the most lightly taxed State in Australia. But when New South Wales entered the Federal Union, her people had to bear the burden of heavy Customs taxation. They did not see the millions trickling back into 'the State Treasury. The people generally have enough to do in bustling round to earn their own living, and do not fully realize that a large portion of the money taken out of their pockets in the form of taxation is returned to the State Treasury. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner said, in recommending the Kingston Tariff to Parliament, that after it had been in operation for three or four years the amount of taxation under it would be reduced, because it would have the effect of bringing industries into existence, and thereby of reducing the quantity of goods imported. That was good sound logic from a protectionist point of view. But we have had some years of protectionist duties, and the people have had to pay import duties from Monday morning to-Saturday night. Suppose that the Lyne-Chapman Tariff is passed very much in the form in which it is submitted to us? Does the Treasurer expect that fresh factories will spring up within six months or two years? Does any. one expect that scores of belching chimneys will arise, indicating where factories are producing thousands of pounds worth of goods that are now imported from the outside world? At present, the factories that are in existence have not sufficient men and plant to fulfil orders. The most advanced protectionist who considers the facts must come to the conclusion that whilst this Tariff remains in operation the people will simply continue to be paying millions more than are necessary for the purposes of government. They will not be consoled by being assured that a large portion nf the money will be paid' back to the States Treasurers. In the meantime, the members of this Parliament will have to bear the opprobrium of placing upon the backs of the people heavier taxation than they had to bear in the pre- Federal days. What I chiefly regret is that we  have not the power to ear-mark the money returned to the States. If we could it would probably remove a great deal of the feeling which now exists. But while it is true that the people get back a considerable amount of the revenue in an indirect manner, still it has to be remembered that there are considerable leakages, and that the people receive no real compensation for the money that is taken from them. Even if they did, I must confess that I belong to that school of thought which holds that the people themselves are much more competent to spend their own money than any Government can possibly be. It may be an old-fashioned view, but it is the one that I stick to. Whatever we do with regard to these Estimates, I trust that the Committee will suspend action upon the items relating to defence until we know more about the policy of the Government. We were told in the early days of this Parliament, on the authority of the Prime Minister, that it was not intended to continue the Naval Agreement. My own strong opinion is, that the Naval Agreement should be continued, and, further, I believe that if the people of Australia were polled the majority would be willing to pay even more than £200,000 a year if necessary. None of us are sufficiently well versed in the subject to know whether the money voted for defence is well or ill spent, and we have to trust to the Government. The only true test of the efficiency of a defence ' force is war ; and thai test we, of course, do not desire to undergo. While we do not believe in being miserly in regard to defences, there ought to be no squandering of money with the practically civil force on which we depend. As I said before, the Government ought to take the Committee into their confidence in regard to their policy when they ask us to Vote such a large sum of money as is now proposed. The excuse that the Prime Minister is absent is not .sufficient. No one regrets more than I do the enforced absence of any honorable member; but the affairs of Australia must not be permitted to drift simply on account of the sickness of the Prime Minister. I understand from the newspapers that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> was strong enough to-day to pass an opinion on the defence policy of Great Britain as forecasted by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Haldane.</inline></para>

                                <para>- On the other hand the right honorable member for Swan is very much in favour of taking over the debts; and it is remarkable that the States do not surrender the debts. Why have not the States debts been taken over when the Constitution provides for that being done? Some persons who pose as financiers have said that we should save £30,000,000 by taking over the States debts. I am not one who shuts his eyes and opens his mouth and then thanks God for what is sent him, and I do not believe that statement, but I am prepared to have the States debts taken over that we may see what can be saved. If we can show them that we can make such a bargain as has been suggested by the taking over of States debts contracted prior to Federation, we can trust the people of the different States to compel their respective Governments to surrender also the debts contracted since Federation. I have enough horse-sense to recognise that the brokers operating on the London market, who are amongst the keenest financiers in the world, and know as much about our affairs as we do ourselves, will take care that if there are millions to be made by this transaction very few of them will come to the Commonwealth. However, we have the power to take over the debts of the States, and I believe that every function of the Commonwealth Parliament should be speedily assumed. The time is not far distant when we must ask ourselves whether we are Federalists or States representatives. If any proposal is made by which the States may suffer injustice, or which may involve an invasion of States rights, the Senate is the House in which the battle should be fought out. If I were a member of the Senate, I should hold the opinion that in dealing with such matters the House of Representatives is invading the province of the States House. I am surprised that the Senate has not long before this asserted its position. I am afraid that honorable senators are as ready to surrender  their powers as we are in the House of Representatives, and if they do not soon wake up the Senate will become a mere revising Chamber, such as are the Legislative Councils of the various States Parliaments. The Ministry have the numbers behind them. It is impossible with thirty-one members to outvote forty-two, and it is therefore a waste of time to continue this struggle. But we should realize that, no matter what Government is in power, it is a serious mistake to surrender our rights as representative men. I complain that the Treasurer has to-day dealt with matters which should have been included in his Budget statement. </para>

It will be some years before the local factories will be established and will be able to supply our requirements, and, in the meantime, heavy importations must take place, so" that we shall in consequence be extracting unnecessary revenue from the people. I say this as a low-Tariff man speaking to a high-Tariff man like the Postmaster-General. </para>

I would like to ask the Acting Prime Minister whether he would not, if he had the power, impose a Tariff as high as that of Russia ? The Postmaster-General, as a high-Tariff man, believes in protection, and that everything that can be manufactured in Australia should be manufactured here. That is the protectionist belief, but I would ask the honorable gentleman whether it is right that we should extract millions of money from the people when he knows that it must be a number of years before the local manufacturers can supply their requirements ? </para>

                                <para>- The best of all dates, but it was not the 17th of March. If some bad-livered people were present these interjections might lead to a scene, such as we have had between two members of the Committee to-night. If I could provoke a scene which would lead to my expulsion from the Chamber about a month before an election, I think it would secure my seat. It is a good plan sometimes to provoke a scene, but it is not on my list tonight. I am afraid that the honorable members for Swan and Coolgardie have started their scene two and a half years too early. I contrast the fine speech which was made by the honorable member for Parramatta on the financial position with that made by the Acting Prime Minister. The honorable member for Parramatta analyzed the figures quoted by the Treasurer whilst that honorable gentleman took the statement written by the Under-Secretary of the Treasury and read it out to the Committee. I do not expect the honorable gentleman to be poetic every time he speaks, but I do expect him to deliver his own speech and not to allow a departmental officer to make his speech for him. That is a scandal on representative government. I should prefer the rough-and-ready way in which the honorable gentleman would deliver a financial statement of his own. </para>

                                <para>- The speech which he made this afternoon will read as if it had been delivered at the Morgue. The kind of speech that the people like is one that has some life in it. The Treasurer, with all his faults, would have been heard to greater advantage had he spoken in his own rough-and-ready way, instead of delivering a polished essay prepared by the head of his Department. The officer in question may be one of the most skilful in the service, but I object to his making a speech in this House. </para>

                        <para class="block">Treasurer is capable of preparing his own speeches. I am not casting any reflection upon his capacity. I have simply referred to what I consider to be. an infringement of our rights. The financial question has not been properly dealt with by the Government, and I hope that the Treasurer, when he replies later on, will clear up several points. We are here, not to deal with Joseph Carruthers or William Lyne, but with the finances of the Commonwealth; and the time is fast arriving when we shall have to take up the defence of Federal rights. The more lax our method of dealing with these great problems of finance is, the more difficult will it be for members of the Federal Parliament to maintain their true position. I am not actuated by any party feeling in speaking thus. I may not be talking to slow music, and, perhaps, if some* other honorable member were to give utterance, with a great show of dignity, to the views I have expressed, honorable members would think that they were worthy of consideration. If we are to defend the powers of the Federal Parliament, we must start early by putting ourselves in a right position in dealing with the financial relations of  the Commonwealth and the States. There is no more important work before us. I do not believe in a high Tariff, and in the raising of ^10,500,000 per annum by means of Customs and Excise taxation. Three or four years hence the Government will find that their policy of protection is ineffective. Industries cannot be built up in a month, and, as a believer in a low Tariff, I have a right to- protest whenever the opportunity offers against heavy imposts. </para>

                                <para>- At all events, I do not know that anything that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers</inline> might say would justify any honorable member in misrepresenting the actual state of affairs with regard to the finances of New South Wales. The correct figures are these : In 1899 the expenditure in New South Wales was £9,708,000. By the year 1904, when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers</inline> again succeeded to the Premiership, the expenditure had gone up to £11,384,000, notwithstanding all the functions that had been relegated to the Federal Parliament. Consequently between 1899 and 1904there was an increase of State expenditure of no less than £1,675,000. That was during the administration of the Government which was instituted by the Acting Prime Minister. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member was in it therefore for nearly two years. I am quoting the increase in expenditure in five years, during two of which the honorable gentleman had charge of affairs in New South Wales. He resigned his position early in 1901. One of his old colleagues took his place, and the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the Government remained practically the same. To all intents and purposes it was a continuous Government. I am not concerned with charging anything to that Government. What' I am concerned with is the correct state of affairs so far as concerns the present Premier of New South Wales. In 1904 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers</inline> succeeded to the Premiership. By that time the expenditure had gone up by no less than £1,675,000. </para>

                                <para>- What has that to do with it? If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers</inline> has transferred the cost of roads and bridges to the local government bodies, he has transferred taxation to them also. He has given them his land tax to operate upon, and guaranteed to them huge subsidies for this year. Therefore, he has not relieved himself of one penny of expenditure this year by the passage of the Local Government Act. Ultimately there will be some relief to the national finances, but not this year. I am only concerned now in showing that the Acting Prime Minister did the Premier of New South Wales a great injustice in alleging that he had sent the expenditure of New South Wales up by £2,000,000, when as a matter of fact he has only increased it by a little over £200,000 in the four years. </para>

                                <para>- I did not mention his Government. I mentioned the Government of New South Wales since Federation. I will give the correct figures, which the honorable member has not given. I did not refer to any particular time since Federation took place. I said that the increase had occurred during the existence of the Federation. The honorable member for Parramatta tried very unfairly to put a wrong construction on everything I said. The State expenditure of New South Wales in 1899-1900, the year before Federation, was £9,045,096. In the year 1905-6, it was £11,395,243, or an increase of £2,350,147. Those are the exact figures, taken from the Treasury accounts. They are absolutely correct. </para>

The honorable member for Parramatta tried to fix upon me the responsibility for a Government that was not my Government. I had no control over the expenditure of the Government that followed me. What I say is that during the period of Federation, and since I gave up the reins of government in New South Wales, the increase of expenditure in that State has amounted to over £2,300,000. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member for Parramatta does not want any one to apologize for him. The honorable member tried to fix on me a statement which I never made regarding <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers.</inline> What he has said is absolutely incorrect. I did not fasten the responsibility for the increase upon <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers</inline> at all. I never named any person or Government. I said that during the period of Federation the See Government and the Carruthers Government in New South Wales had dealt with the finances in the way which I described. I complain of the honorable member saying that I made an attack upon <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers.</inline> I did nothing of the kind. I was only anxious to lay before the Committee and the country the exact state of the finances during the period of the Federation as it had been said that the Commonwealth had been, and is, extravagant. My object was not to hit any individual or Ministry, but to defend the Commonwealth Government and Parliament, and to show that instead of having those reflections hurled at us we should be commended for the economy which we have practised, and for not carrying out works which we might very reasonably have undertaken. The honorable member is always attributing some motive to me, but to-night I had not in my mind <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers</inline> or his Government or any person in New South Wales. I came here simply to lay the figures before the Committee and the country in order to show what had happened. The honorable member for Dalley referred to my having read a financial statement. A man who is not an expert in figures, such as the Secretary to the Treasury is, is a fool if he depends on himself and gives figures to the Committee in a not understandable way. </para>

                                <para>- The application of the figures is done in a way which even the honorable member in his denseness cannot misunderstand. Let him look through the Budget as it was delivered by me and he can understand "it. Let him look through the reply which I gave tonight, and he can understand it. I have heard Treasurers trying to make their speeches without having had them either typed or the figures typed, and a nice mess they made of them. I do not intend to place myself in that position. I do not pretend to be an expert in dealing with the figures of the Treasury. I have to look to my officers to prepare the figures and to throw upon them the responsibility for their accuracy. I believe that the people would rather trust the officers who have been so long in the Treasury to furnish the figures than trust to any Treasurer, I do not care who he is, to analyze the figures and give them himself. </para>

                    <para>. - Some days since I referred to the dilatory manner in which correspondence is attended to by the Department of the Postmaster-General. To-day. I received from the Department three letters, namely, one in reply to a letter forwarded on the 13th April, respecting the necessity for telephone communication in my electorate; another in reply to a letter I forwarded on the 19th April, on a similar matter of much urgency ; and another in reply to a letter sent on the nth June, respecting the great urgency of providing telephone communication to business-houses and private persons, and the connexion of townships in my electorate. The receipt of the letters was acknowledged at the time in a formal way, and to-day, after a period of five and three months respectively, I received a reply to them. It shows, I think, that the Department is managed in a very slipshod manner. </para>

                        <para>- It may be that the inspectors are over-worked and unable to report on matters forwarded to them for consideration. Once I met an inspector working on a Sunday in my electorate, far from the large centres of population, in order to get through with his work. I was told on one occasion that the inspectors received large batches of papers and had to sit into the middle of the night in order to deal with them. Judging by the long delay in replying to my communications, the officers are overworked. I hope that the Postmaster-General will look into the matter and see that some alterations are made so that one may expect to receive a reply to his communications within a reasonable period. During last year I forwarded to the Department scores of letters, but up to the present time I have not received a reply. </para>

                    <para>.- It is of no use for the Acting Prime Minister to go into mock heroics, or to shed crocodile tears. We are all used to that now, as we have known him ever since the Parliament was opened. I beg to inform the honorable gentleman that I am neither drunk nor stupid. I am in possession of my faculties just as much as he is. I was listening to the remarks of the honorable member for Parramatta as intently as I could. He did not try to juggle with the Treasurer's figures. All he wanted to do was to fix the blame upon the authorities who were responsible for the increased expenditure. What he said was that there was £300,000 expended by the Carruthers Government over and above the expenditure of 1904. He did not say that the Acting Prime Minister had misstated figures. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not intend to say anything in regard to the matter referred to by the honorable . member for Maranoa, or as to what took place in Committee between the  deputy  leader of the Opposition and the Acting Prime Minister. These matters can, I take it, be discussed when the consideration of the Works and Buildings Estimates in Committee of Supply is resumed', and the honorable member for Maranoa and others will then have an opportunity to deal with them at length. But as to the complaint of the honorable member for Robertson, I desire to say that I am of opinion that we should have great sympathy with the officers of the Postal Department in regard to the delays in the answering of correspondence which are laid at their door. For months past it has been impossible for the men employed in the correspondence branch of the New South Wales Post Office to meet the demands made upon them. I have already shown that that is so, and on a future occasion will do so at greater length, and will put before honorable members a more definite statement of the position than has hitherto been given to the public. I trust that the Postmaster-General and the Treasurer will, as soon as possible, relieve the pressure from which the officers of the Department have suffered too long, and which* results in delays in replying to the correspondence which members have to conduct in the interests of their constituents. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that the present System has had a fair trial. Hitherto we have not had permanent inspectors, but have employed " acting inspectors, with the result that they have overlapped, or the report of one has been contrary to that of another. There has been a muddle, because there has been no security of tenure, so far as the officers acting have been concerned. We cannot hope for an improvement until the serious grievances which have been laid at the door of the Department have been rectified. I trust that the Postmaster-General, who has been looked to to effect a wonderful improvement, will not merely promise to do something, but will prove his sincerity by his actions. </para>

                    <para>. - In reference to the complaint of the honorable member for Robertson, if he will give me the particular instance I shall have inquiries made. I believe that there is a great deal in what he said. The abnormal increase in the work of the Department has not been adequately provided for by the appointment of additional men. But I hope to visit Sydney within a week or ten days, and to make personal inquiries there. Arrangements have been, or are being, made to give clerical assistance to the inspectors which will enable them to get through their work with something like reasonable expedition. </para>

I quoted figures to-night showing that 4,440 appointments have been made, and that there had been 3,393dismissals, leaving a net increase of 1,007.In reference to the question asked by the honorable member for Cook, so far as my memory serves me application was at once made to the South Australian Government, who possessed all the information necessary for the preparation of the return which was asked for. When I inquired the other day, I found that no reply had been received from South Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I should not think that the South Australian Government desire to' withhold the information, because they are the most friendly of the States Governments so far as the Commonwealth is concerned. I shall see whether anything further can be done in the matter. I desire to take this opportunity to refer to the dreadful fires which have occurred in the coastal districts of New South Wales. This is, perhaps, the first time on record in Australia when a large and flourishing township has been destroyed by fire within an hour or two. Then there occurred a second conflagration between Casino and Grafton, involving the loss of twelve or fourteen houses. I am sending a telegram of regret on behalf of the Ministry, . and, with the permission of honorable members, I shall send a similar message on behalf of the House, because the catastrophies are such as to call for some expression of sympathy on our part. </para>
