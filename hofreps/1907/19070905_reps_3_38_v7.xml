                        <para>On the 8th of May last, we took an order to indent several hundred chairs .for a  restaurant, to be delivered in October, at a price, calculated (of course) on the old rate of duty,  20  per cent. With the present duty of 7s. <inline font-style="italic">ti.</inline> per chair, it will be quite impossible for our client to take them. We have tried several factories in the different States, but none can supply a chair suitable either in design or price. </para>

                    <para class="block">The writer of the second letter declares that before the new Tariff was introduced he lodged his papers to clear a consignment of chairs, but has, nevertheless, been required to pay the new rate. I desire to know from the Minister whether, if duty is paid under protest in cases of this kind, and the rate proposed by the Government is reduced by Parliament, the difference will be recoverable by the importers? I desire, too, to know whether the liability for duty is fixed by the time at which an entry is handed in, or by the time at which the papers are countersigned and completed by the Department? </para>

                            <para>- All questions affecting rates of duty are matters for Parliament to deal with. As regards the time fixing the liability for .duty, I refer the honorable member to section 132&#39; of the Customs Act, which enacts that all import duties shall be paid at the  Tate  in force when the goods are entered for home consumption. </para>

Suppose that, instead of the .rate on chairs having been increased, it had been decreased, does the honorable member not think that his correspondent, on completing his entry, would have tendered payment at the lower rate? The time fixed by the Customs Act for the payment of duties is when entries are completed. Of course, Parliament can alter the Act ; but while it remains in force I must see that its provisions are conformed to. </para>

Was that not done under a former Tariff ? I should also like to know whether the provision of the. Customs Act which the Minister has quoted is not in conflict with that of the Excise Act, which implies that duty is payable when goods have been imported, and whether the text-books do not say that importation is complete when goods have entered a port. </para>

The information asked for is given in the documents which I now desire to lay on the table; and I find that there is a total of 121 items on which the free-trade section of the Commission recommended duties, but which the protectionist section recommended should be admitted free. Those items have been made free in the Tariff ; and they are shown in the list which I hold in my hand. The documents, which may be printed, are mainly in answer to the statement of the honorable member for Perth that a wrong construction had been placed on the recommendations made by himself and his free-trade colleagues. </para>

                        <para>- No; to the last State election in Queensland. It was not to be expected- that&#34; the Postmaster-General would have at his fingers&#39; ends the information I required, but since then I have had a communication from the Department in reference to the action taken at Townsville, though up to the present I1 have had no communication in reference to the action taken at Charters Towers. It is well that honorable members should clearly understand the importance of this matter, so that they may appreciate the seriousness of the action of the postmaster at Townsville. When the last Electoral Bill was before the Queensland State Parliament a clause was inserted to allow of women voting by post. I may say that that clause was accepted at the time in order to save the Bill : and though that fact may have nothing to do with- us as a Commonwealth Parliament, I desire to say unhesitatingly that so corrupt were the practices under that postal voting section, that within the Federal sphere I, for one, shall vote against any form of postal voting. I am thoroughly convinced that postal voting; has been used in. Queensland by unscrupulous people to violate the secrecy of the ballot. My belief is that, no matter how we safeguard this class of voting, we shall have undue. influence exercised. </para>

                        <para>- I see much difficulty in carrying out the system; and, by way of illustration, I shall cite one or two instances.&#39; Justices of the peace in Queensland go about and ask the women voters to vote 6y post, and, when the women decline to do so, those justices call round with the manager of the mine at which the women&#39;s husbands are employed and intimate that voting must be by post. What is a woman to do under the circumstances ? If she refuses to vote by post, she feels that her refusal mav injure the prospects of her husband and her family ; and I say unhesitatingly that in  90  per cent, of the cases in which people vote by post, it is known how they vote. </para>

                        <para>- In such cases voting by post would be legitimate, and I am not now speaking of electors so circumstanced. However, even in the case of invalids and others, it is known how they vote. As- a justice of the peace in Queensland I have witnessed a number of signatures in connexion with postal voting, and I do not hesitate to say that I knew how each elector cast his vote. I say that honestly and candidly - it is of no use saying that we do not know. I might look out of the window or at the pictures on the wall, but I should be a hypocrite to say that I did not know how those people had voted. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that if the electors had taken the matter seriously, and had desired to keep me from knowing, I probably could not have seen how they voted. In Victoria, when the honorable member for Echuca was returned, notwithstanding all the restriction^, there were  2,000  postal votes. However, I am getting away from my point. Under the Queensland Act postal ballot-papers, when signed by the electors, must be stamped with that day&#39;s post-mark; and this is where the Commonwealth and the Post and Telegraph Department are affected. The post offices close at 8 o&#39;clock at night, and after that hour ballot-papers which came in were practically informal, because, in the ordinary course of events, they would, not be stamped until next_ morning, and would, therefore, bear a post-mark dated the following day. After a number of such ballot-papers had come in at Townsville, there was an interview between the returning officer and the local postmaster. Permission was asked to leave the ballot-box at the post office so that ballot-papers which came in might be placed in it. There was no objection to that suggestion ; but it came to the knowledge of some people - I do not know how - that certain postal votes were informal owing to the date upon which they were signed not agreeing with the post-mark or date, and then there was another interview between the returning officer and the postmaster. This seems to be the serious part of the story; because the returning officer. was led to believe that owing to the date on which they were stamped certain ballot-papers were rendered informal. How that came to the knowledge of the returning officer I do not know, but according to a letter I have received from the Department he &#34;went to the postmaster and suggested that an arrangement should be made to have the post office kept open for the receipt pf those postal votes until 12 o&#39;clock at night, as it was not likely that there would be any received between that hour and  5  the following morning. As a matter of fact, I believe that only one postal vote was received within those hours; but, on the other hand, between  8  o&#39;clock and midnight, there were a great number sent in. The postmaster said he could not keep any of the officials there, but he would remain himself until midnight and stamp the papers. Why should those postal -voting-papers be treated differently from any other postal matter? If it is possible for a postmaster to make such a distinction, it is possible for him to make a similar distinction in regard -to any document posted. Another brilliant idea conceived by the postmaster was to attend to these postal voting-papers at  s  o&#39;clock next morning, and use the previous day&#39;s stamp, which by that hour had not been altered. I maintain that the postmaster had no right to follow that course, and, in doing so, he took upon himself a very serious responsibility. This is more apparent when we realize that in those elections the candidates who were returned were beaten by an overwhelming majority, so far as the ballot-box was concerned. In one case, the candidates were beaten by over 600 votes in the ballot-box, though they secured a majority on the postal ballot-papers. </para>

The communication I have received from the Department states that the postmaster at Townsville told no one outside his office, not even the returning officer, of the action he had taken, and that he was actuated by &#39; the purest motives, having no idea of partiality for either side. I do not wish to accuse the postmaster of desiring in any shape or form to show partiality ; I at once dismiss that idea. But the fact remains that he took upon himself a serious responsibility in stamping the voting papers in the way I have indicated, and the House should let the Postmaster-General know that in its opinion it is undesirable that there should be a recurrence of the incident. No action has been taken in Townsville for the reason that those concerned have not the necessary funds at their disposal. But for this further litigation would probably have ensued. A postmaster should not attempt to go beyond the ordinary routine of his office without consulting either the Postmaster-General or his  deputy.  Many people might be involved in expensive litigation and caused much inconvenience by such proceedings. I think that I ha.ve shown ample justification fpr bringing this matter before the House, and I hope that the Postmaster-General will take action to prevent a repetition of such proceedings. </para>

                        <para>- - But the honorable member&#39;s observations in regard to the working of the State Act apply with equal force to the administration of the Federal Electoral Act. I do not propose at this stage to enumerate all its defects, but I am satisfied that fresh machinery will have to be devised in connexion with its administration, and that an amending Bill is necessary. At the present time it is administered in , a rough-and-ready way by public servants and persons outside the service who are employed temporarily, and at short notice, to conduct an election. I trust that the Postmaster-General will see that in future postal officers are not called upon to carry out the electoral law, for their ordinary duties are quite sufficient to occupy the whole of their attention. The Department of Home Affairs should assume full control of the administration of the Act. This afternoon I asked a question without notice with regard to the steps taken by the Government to recover the  &#163;25,000  supposed to have been deposited by the contractors for the oversea mail service. It seems that this question, which we have already heard on many occasions in the House, will have to be asked again and again. A few months ago the Government took credit for having made a rattling good bargain, and published the intelligence that in their opinion a more satisfactory mail contract had never been entered into. We find, however, that they have floundered and foundered in connexion with it. The ex-Postmaster-General claimed that he had displayed great business acumen in connexion with the negotiations. Nevertheless the Postmaster-General to-day had to consult one of his colleagues before he replied to my question. During the debate on the Budget, I said that Messrs. Barclay and Company had certainly given a guarantee, but that as. business men they had fixed a date on or before which the bond should be entered into. As keen bankers, they now say that no bond was entered into on or before the date fixed, and that consequently they cannot be called upon to liquidate the guarantee. The Attorney-General combated my statement, and said that there would be no difficulty in presenting to the House all the papers relating to the negotiations; but so far a copy of the guarantee has not been produced. When I asked that it should be presented, I was told that I ought to give notice of motion ; and when I inquired whether such a motion would be allowed to go without opposition, I received no answer from the Government. As an old parliamentarian, I recognised that in that case silence meant, not consent, but resistance. There must be some reason for withholding from Parliament and public a copy of the guarantee, but I trust that it will be produced to-morrow. . I have Been able to explain to the Postmaster-General and the House generally what was my object in&#62; putting the question to which I have just referred, and the press and public should now be afforded an opportunity to ascertain whether the negotiations were conducted by the Government in a business-like way. There is - another matter to which I desire to refer, and, since it relates to New South Wales, I presume that I must speak of it with bated breath. I asked this afternoon whether the Postmaster-General would be prepared to allow a warning; light to be shown from the tower of the General Post&#39; Office, Sydney, to advise the public of the approach of a southerly. The answer I received was that the matter came within the jurisdiction of the Minister of Home Affairs. Nearly twelve months have elapsed since I first wrote to the Department asking that this light should be shown, and judging by the Minister&#39;s answer, the Government are anxious to further delay the settlement of the question. I would point out that there is a precedent, for the course I have suggested. For years a day signal has been flown from the tower of the post office to warn those using the harbor of the approach of a southerly. Hundreds of fishermen ply for a living in and about the waters of Port Jackson, and if on nearing the Heads at night they saw a warning signal from the post office tower they would at once put back, for they would know that if a southerly were approaching it would be useless for them to go outside the Heads. Pleasure parties returning from trips down the Harbor at night would also be advantaged by a warning signal being shown, and since it is admitted by the Minister that the cost of erecting the light would be only <inline font-style="italic">&#163;41,</inline> I hope that my request will be acceded to. The Acting Prime Minister, who, like myself, takes an interest in aquatics, will know that at night it is difficult for a man on the harbor to quickly detect the approach of a southerly. </para>

I -appeal to the Postmaster-General to approach the Minister of Home Affairs, and to offer him the use of the post office tower at Sydney for the purpose. I wish now to refer very briefly to the question of the Federal Capital site. Can the Attorney-General say when the Seat of Government Bill will be dealt with? The Department of Home Affairs has provided opportunities for new members to inspect the various sites under review, and it is only right that they should enjoy such a privilege, just as older members of the House have done. I understand that the last Parliamentary party to visit Dalgety saw it under most unfavorable circumstances from the standpoint of the advocates of that site.  </para>

                        <para>- I referred to the fact that there is on the business-paper a Bill dealing with this question, in order that my constituents would understand why I was unable to go thoroughly into the question. I think that the Acting Prime Minister should take steps to remove the dissatisfaction in New South Wales in regard to this matter. I should not have risen but for the fact that the matters to which I have directed attention have received such curt treatment at the hands of the &#39;Government. I trust that the Postmaster-General will consent to a light being exhibited from the tower of the General Post Office, Sydney, fo warn those persons using the harbor of the approach of a southerly. Regarding the guarantee in connexion with the mail contract which was recently cancelled, I say that the public should be placed in possession pf a full knowledge of its terms. I never could understand why the Postmaster-General insists upon withholding from the press information of which the public should be seised. If the people were daily posted in the actions of Ministers it naturally follows that they would have more confidence in them. If, in connexion with the cancelled mail contract, a bargain was made which w&#39;as irretrievably bad, doubtless the public would be prepared to make a generous allowance. . They are always ready to pardon a blunder, but in the twentieth century they require, through the channels of the newspapers, absolute publicity in regard to &#39;Ministerial actions. I see no advantage to be derived from adopting Star Chamber methods by withholding information as to the terms of the guarantee. The &#34; shut your eyes and open your ears, and we will give you some information to-morrow &#34; method will not answer nowadays. When the contract with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir James</inline> Laing and Co. was made, honorable members will recollect that throughout the length and breadth of the Commonwealth the Government was credited with having concluded a very good bargain. I was one of those credulous mortals who stated at the time that the terms of that contract sounded too good to be true, but that if they were true the Ministry were entitled to all the kudos attaching to their action. Now, I ask that a copy of the guarantee should be placed upon the table of the House. In the early portion of the session some honorable members made the guarantee of ,&#163;25,000 for the due performance of the contract the theme of numerous questions, which were addressed to Ministers. Their zeal, however, suddenly disappeared. I. do not see why honorable members should not be afforded the information which I seek  in  the ordinary way, but if  it  is not forthcoming  in  that way the only alternative presented to me will be to move the adjournment of the House. </para>

                    <para>. - I join with the honorable member for Dalley  in  protesting against the treatment accorded  by  Ministers to questions asked  by  honorable members upon this side of the House. I think that members of the Opposition have just cause for complaint  in  this connexion, and especially against the Postmaster-General, who is a most constant  offender.  If a question be put  to  them from the opposite side of the Chamber - and especially from the Labour corner - Ministers are deferential, if &#39;not abjectly apologetic in formulating their replies. But when an honorable member upon the Opposition side of the House ventures  to  ask a question upon any matter of public interest, Ministers evidently- think that  it  can be disposed of either  by an  evasive reply or  by  a request that notice should be given of the question. It  is  about time that  we  protested against treatment of this kind. I warn Ministers that if I do not&#39; receive satisfactory replies to any  Questions  which I may put to them,  or  if I believe that they deliberately desire to flout  me,  I shall be reluctantly compelled  to  move the adjournment of the House in order to obtain the desired information. Only a few days ago I asked a series of questions in regard to the action of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Baxter,</inline> Acting Comptroller of Customs, Sydney,  in  calling upon three carriers to return their licences and  to  show cause why those licences should not be cancelled, simply because they Had acted  in  accordance with instructions which they had received from a Government contractor  in  assisting to  remove  certain wire netting. The Minister of Trade and Customs,  in  reply, informed me that he knew nothing about the matter, . which was  in  the hands of the Acting Prime Minister. At the present time  we  occupy this unfortunate position : that  we  have two Ministers controlling the Customs Department. The next  day  I  addressed  the following questions, upon notice, to the Acting Prime Minister - </para>

I desire to point out that they occupy positions which do not entitle them to take up an attitude of that kind, and replies which savour of insolence are an insult not only to those asking the questions, . but to the House as a whole - this sort of thing cannot be tolerated.

                    <para>Yesterday morning, however, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sutton</inline> was served with a Supreme Court writ for having&#39; unlawfully removed goods from Customs control, and Messrs.

Baxter, Acting Collector of Customs.&#34; </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">I take it that such a letter has been received by these carriers, otherwise what purports to be a copy of it would not have been published in the Sydney press. Now, it is well known that these carriers cannot perform certain work unless they hold Customs licences. If they are deprived of these licences they cannot earn their ordinary livelihood. In other words, before they have been convicted of any &#39; offence, they have been prevented - owing to the arbitrary action of a Commonwealth officer - from earning a&#39; livelihood. I say that it is contrary to all ideas of British justice that a man should be condemned and punished before his guilt has been established. It&#39; would have been quite sufficient if the Acting Collector of Customs in Sydney had called upon the carriers to show cause why their licences should not be cancelled. It was no part of their duty - before acting upon the instructions which had been received from the New South Wales Government - for these carriers  to ascertain whether that Government was acting legally in requesting them to undertake certain work. That . is a responsibility which should not be thrown upon them. . To whatever party a member may belong, I take it that there is inherent in each of us a feeling of reverence for the principle of justice and fair play underlying the British maxim that a man shall be deemed innocent until he has been .proved guilty. Apparently, the Acting Comptroller of Customs at Sydney, or whoever authorized the sending of the letter to which I have referred, wishes to throw on these men the responsibility of ascertaining whether the State Government acted rightly in ordering the removal of certain goods. In my opinion, that is a wrong position to take up, and I hope that the Minister, now that his attention has been drawn to the matter, will see&#39; that the injustice is not permitted to continue. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member may make the case the subject of a jest, but it is really a very serious thing for the men concerned. I do not know them, and have not been in communication with them, but I ask what will happen to them now that their licences have been withdrawn. Even the temporary withdrawal of their licences will prevent them from carrying on their business, and will throw out of work those whom they employ, and their horses and vehicles. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. Because of the temporary withdrawal of their licences, other carriers will be enabled to step in, and take away part of their business, for the large firms for whom they act will not suspend operation&#39;s merely because they cannot get these particular carters. The men will suffer an injury in pocket for which they can get no redress, as well as an injury inreputation. </para>

                        <para>- In this case, no offence has been proved, and no accusation made. There has been a mere imputation of wrong-doing. What was to prevent the Minister, or one of his officers, from holding an investigation and giving the men an opportunity to state their case? Had that been done, and had a breach of the law been proved, action could have been taken against the men. What would be thought if our Judges sentenced persons before hearing the charges against them? The community would be up in arms. </para>

                        <para>- It is paltry for the Government, which is not game to attack the Premier of New South Wales, the prime mover in this affair, to take action against&#34; unfortunate men who are merely carrying out instructions received in the ordinary course of business. Not only has a writ been issued against the contractor for the New South Wales Government, but the Customs officials have vented their spite and vengeance in this paltry manner against three unfortunates employed by him. It is an action unworthy of a Government, and, under ordinary circumstances, would be sufficient to oust an Administration. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister knows very well that in his following there are those who, though they thought the Ministry absolutely wrong, would still support them ; the Minister is perfectly safe in issuing an invitation of that kind. I do not quite know, with the divided control there is, which Minister is responsible for the Department of Trade and Customs ; but I express the hope that those men who were instrumental in removing the wire netting from the custody of the Customs in New South Wales will be given an opportunity to state their defence, and that they will not be deprived temporarily of their ordinary work while others are allowed to step into their places. </para>

                        <para>- I merely referred to the Tariff incidentally, in order to intimate that the Acting Prime Minister will not be able to recognise it when we have finished with its consideration. I have no desire to discuss the question of the Federal Capital, beyond asking the Acting Prime Minister whether he can definitely say that the matter will receive consideration before the close of the session ? Surely that is a fair and reasonable question. The time for bluffing is over. The present Minister of Trade and Customs has been bluffing honorable members in regard to the Federal Capital for years, but it is now time we had some definite information. </para>

                        <para>- There is no greater . bluffer in this House than the Acting Prime Minister ; he bluffs every time a question is asked from this side of the House; and against such an attitude on his part I must protest. In fact, this is a Ministry of bluff and bluster. We get nothing but bluff, al-, though we &#34;are entitled, in connexion with such a question as that to which I refer, to definite information. The delay in the selection of the Federal Capital Site, and other matters, are causing great friction amongst the people of New South Wales. Instead of trying to meet the reasonable wishes of the people of the mother State, the Federal Capital question, and the question of the financial arrangements are delayed, and much irritation is caused. I guarantee that if the Acting Prime Minister went into New South Wales at the present moment, he would find discontent from one end to the other, on account of, amongst other grievances, Melbourne being made the head-quarters of various Departments which at one time were administered in the adjoining State, and the persistent efforts to assist Victoria, and chiefly Melbourne, to dominate the whole Commonwealth. </para>

I think it is time that honorable members were given some information as to what action has been taken, with the object of realizing on the &#163;25,000 bond entered into in connexion with the cancelled mail contract with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir James</inline> Laing and Sons. Earlier in the session I asked several questions on this subject, only to be bluffed by the present Minister of Trade and Customs, who was then the Postmaster-General. Up to the present time the honorable gentleman has not been able to give us any information of a definite character, and  now that we are about to enter on the consideration of the Estimates, we ought to have some satisfactory answers to the many questions that have been asked in this connexion. Have any legal steps been taken to recover the money? Have the Government authorized their agent in London to issue a writ for the recovery of the money? Are the Government willing to lav on the table all the papers and correspondence in connexion with this matter? Honorable members are undoubtedly entitled to all the information I have just suggested. Then, we have not been afforded much information as to the terms of the contract with the Orient Steam Navigation Company ;for the temporary conveyance of our mails, though that is a matter on which Ministers ought to take the House into their confidence. I am continually being asked by my constituents for information on this subject, and it is very unsatisfactory to me to be unable to satisfy them. </para>

                        <para>- Because it is my business to be inquisitive on matters of public importance, especially as several of my constituents are merchants in a large way of business, to whom the terms of a mail contract are of vital importance. It would not have been necessary for me to touch on all these matters this afternoon but for the action of Ministers, who compel honorable members to take this course through the discourteous manner in which questions from this side of the House are treated. Whatever ground of complaint I may have had against the present Minister of Trade and Customs, when hp was formerly Postmaster-General, I must say that,&#39;, in regard Ito all postal matters, he was courteous enough to give me any information I desired. I always endeavour to treat every honorable member with courtesy, and I expect the same consideration extended to myself. If Ministers show discourtesy in replying to ques-&#39; tions simply because they emanate from this side of the House, they must not be surprised if we feel ourselves aggrieved, and I suggest to the present Postmaster-General that he should adopt the plan of his predecessor, and acknowledge every letter addressed to the Department, even though the information asked for may not be available. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Colonel FOXTON</inline>(Brisbane) &#91;4.0&#93;. - I am unwilling to delay the House, but it is due to Queensland members that one of us, at all events, should have a few words to say on the matter referred to by the honorable member for Kennedy. I am not responsible for the fact that this discussion has taken the form somewhat of a medley. Indeed, I should have been very glad, personally, if I could have immediately followed the honorable member whom- 1 have just mentioned. I rise principally for the purpose of deprecating the introduction of matters connected with State elections into the discussions of this Chamber. This is no place to discuss matters of the sort, especially when, as I am sure the honorable member for Kennedy is well aware, the Queensland Parliament &#39; has at present under consideration a measure dealing with them.. I know nothing of the facts beyond those which have been stated by the honorable member, but it seems to me to be undesirable that such matters should be discussed here when the proper place in which to ventilate them is really the State Parliament. It follows almost necessarily that the statements of an honorable member who has posted himself up in the facts must be <inline font-style="italic">ex parte.</inline> They cannot be refuted hy those who may speak after him under the disadvantage of not having had &#39; an opportunity to fully master all the details. Coming to the merits of the case, and taking the facts as related by the honorable member himself, I understand that certain ballot-papers in connexion with a recent State election for Townsville were posted at the local post office. Under the State law, ballot-papers have to be posted on or before a certain date, and unless it is otherwise specified in the section of the Act relating to the matter, the time within which the papers could be posted would terminate at midnight on the date fixed. I take it that unless a particular hour were specified as being that before which they should be posted, the electors would have a statutory right to post their ballot-papers at any time before midnight on the date named. I understand according to the honorable member&#39;s version of the facts, that there is a rule that the Townsville post office shall be closed, and the letter-boxes cleared, at 8 p.m., so that for four hours after the time of closing the electors would have an undoubted statutory right to. post their ballot-papers. It is complained by the honorable member that the postmaster at Townsville on the date fixed - and for the purposes of my argument let us assume that it was the 5th of the month - closed his office at the usual hour, and cleared the letter-boxes, but that at 5 o&#39;clock on the following morning he affixed to the letters in question a stamp bearing the date of the previous day. </para>

                <para>Colonel FOXTON.- I take it that the postmaster was satisfied that the letters in question had been posted, in accordance with the Electoral Act, before  12  o&#39;clock on the previous night* If that be so, he did  exactly what the law required- of him. Had he refused to put on the letters a stamp bearing the date on which they were actually posted, he would not have carried out either the spirit or the letter of the Act, because he would have disfranchised all who had voted by post and lodged their ballot-papers at the post office between 8 p.m. and 12 p.m. on the 5th. I think that the postmaster took up a proper attitude. I repeat that I know nothing of the facts,_ but on the honorable member&#39;s own statement and, having regard <inline font-style="italic">to the</inline> provisions of the electoral law of Queensland with. respect to the right of certain electors to post their ballot-papers on or before a particular date, I do not think that there is any cause for complaint. The electors enjoy the statutory privilege of posting their ballot-papers at any time before midnight on the date fixed. </para>

                <para>  Colonel&#39; FOXTON.-  If the. postmaster had not sp .accommodated himself to&#39; the. circumstances, as to affix to these letters a stamp bearing the date on which they were actually posted, he would have deprived the electors in question pf the highest privilege which a citizen enjoys -  the privilege of . electing his representative in Parliament. Some of the letters containing ballot papers might have been posted between midnight and 5 a.m. on the 6th, but probably the postmaster took steps to prevent letters so lodged being treated as if they had been posted before midnight. If the honorable member for Kennedy has correctly stated his case, it seems to me that there is no cause for complaint against this officer. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Brisbane has been very fair in his criticism, but I differ from him with regard to the essential features of the case. It seems to me that the postmaster at Townsville, possibly with the best intentions, went entirely beyond the law. As a member&#39; of the Commonwealth Public Service he ought not to have taken that step without the authority of his superior officer. As I understand the State Electoral Act, it requires that a.  postal  vote, to be effective, shall bear a cer tain date. The honorable member&#39;sexperience as a lawyer and a public officer must guide him clearly to the conclusion that it would be most dangerous to allow an officer, either in the service of the Commonwealth or the State, to interpret the. law as he thought fit, and to ante-date postal ballot-papers. </para>

If I had any control over officers who attempted to interpret the law as they pleased, I -should regard the offence as a-, very serious one. I agree with the honorable member for Brisbane that we should? not intervene in States matters unless they affect the Commonwealth, but I think no harm can be done by drawing the attention of the Minister to a matter of thiskind.* I understand that the honorable member for Kennedy has made. a statement of the facts, which is in accordance with, the advices received by the Postmaster-General. I - presume that the Bill now before the State Parliament will definitely settle this question. I do not hesitate to say that the postmaster at Townsville acted&#39; in good faith, but that he committed an error which, if allowed to pass unnoticed,, would be inimical to the proper govern ment of the country, and give rise perhaps to a totally wrong impression of what are the duties and privileges of our officers - an impression which ought not to be countenanced by this  Parliament </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to emphasize the complaint made by the honorable member for Kennedy, whose remarks apply with equal force to the state of affairs existing under the Commonwealth electoral law. I agree that it is undesirable for us to interfere in States matters, but since a Commonwealth officer was concerned in this incident, the Postmaster-General should see that in-&#39; future he properly&#39; discharges his duty. I was a member of a Select Committee appointed by the last Parliament to inquire into the administration of the Electoral&#34; Act, and know that abuses connected with voting by post system were brought under its notice. It was found that many, abuses had crept into the system, particularly in connexion with a disputed election* for the electorate of Melbourne - an election which was subsequently voided. We-  : discovered in that case that the system  had been largely abused, and we recom.mended that certain steps should be taken  to remedy the evil. I understand, however, that at the last general election the system was abused pretty generally throughout the. Commonwealth, and I am satisfied that if it be not hedged round with severe restrictions, the intentions of the Parliament with regard to the secrecy of the ballot will be frustrated- It is a system to which recourse should be had only by those who are physically incapable of attending at a polling booth, or will be absent  from their electorates on the day of polling. I have doubts as to the wisdom of a provision which so readily lends itself to :abuse. The circumstances which led to its institution are now met by the provisions relating to absent voters, under which a man may record his vote at a polling place -other than that for which- he is registered, and even at a polling place beyond his own electorate. I have not heard of any abuses arising under that system, and I think the Government should consider the desirableness of substituting it for the system of voting by post. The complaints made throughout the Commonwealth with  respect to postal voting at the last general election are of sufficient importance to warrant the attention of the Government. </para>

                        <para>- It &#34; appears to have been the result of ignorance of the law on the part of the local postmaster and the &#34;&#39;official administering the State Act. Like the honorable member for Kennedy, I consider the complaint a very serious one, and I hope that such an&#39; incident will not occur - again. I agree with a great deal that, the honorable member has said in reference to the system of voting by post. The whole -system is open to very serious abuses and -verv grave dangers. I make that statement with a full knowledge qf the facts, gained whilst temporarily administering the Department of Home Affairs, and I trust that when the amending Bill is introduced, further precautions will be taken to prevent the abuse of what ought to be a very useful system. </para>

                        <para>- In order to ascertain how far the Postal Department is responsible for the irregularities to which attention has been called, I have given instructions for a full inquiry to be made. In regard to the bond for ,&#163;25,000 which was deposited in connexion with the mail contract recently cancelled, I desire to say that the Government have nothing whatever to conceal. A copy of the bond was laid upon the table of the Senate to-day, and another copy will be placed upon the table of this House. Of course, the Executive &#34;officers frequently have some information that they desire to keep private, but even at this stage of the proceedings the Government have nothing to conceal from honorable members. In regard to the remarks of the honorable member for Dalley concerning the necessity for exhibiting a warning signal  from the tower of- the General Post Office, Sydney, to apprise the public of the approach of a southerly, I wish to say that I should be very glad if I were able to afford the public many facilities which they desire. But to provide them with clocks in&#34; the towers of post-offices all over the Commonwealth, and with other similar conveniences, would necessitate a very large outlay indeed. At the present time the Commonwealth is continuing the services which were formerly rendered to the public by the States. It is for that reason that the day signal upon the tower of the General Post Office, Sydney, is still being exhibited. I recognise the usefulness of a night signal such as the honorable member for Dalley has suggested, and will make representations to the Department of Home Affairs with a view to ascertain if something cannot be done in that direction. I am sure that we shall be glad to co-operate with the State in that connexion. As to the Ministerial rebuffs to which the honorable member for Lang called attention, I can assure him that they were quite unintentional. </para>

I think that this Parliament is entitled to know the facts of that case. Has it come to this : That the Government will not disclose to the House what it has done in this connexion, and also the reasons which prompted its action? I do not wish to interfere with the processes of the law in any way whatever, but I submit that we are entitled to know the facts of the case. Why have these men been deprived of their licences? </para>

                        <para>-  I believe that they are, but I am not quite sure. My reason for saying &#34;I believe that they are&#34; is that, in conversation .with the Minister of Trade and Customs, I suggested that their licences should be held by the Department, but that, until something further was done, they should not be deprived of the means of earning their livelihood. I believe that my suggestion has been adopted. </para>

I am sure that we are all delighted to hear that these carriers are being still permitted to earn their livelihood - as they have every right to do - and that they, are not to be subjected to any disability simply .because they had the bad luck to be employed by their usual employer without, perhaps, knowing anything of the merits of the dispute. </para>

                    <para>At present they are almost prohibitive. The first item is that of wheels. Duty charged at 33s. per set irrespective of quality; duty on wheels formerly 20 per cent, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> is now 33s. per set, and will amount to, on a i&#163; B quality wheel, 95 per cent.; C quality, 112 per cent. ; D quality, 155 per cent, on invoice cost irrespective of freights, charges, and profits, which must be added. We have been negotiating to put machinery into our works, but in view of the duties being imposed we have abandoned the idea. If material for those wheels could be obtained in the country there would be good reasons for imposing a specific duty. America is the only place in which hickory can be procured, and the demand is so great that it takes as long as eighteen months at a time to land wheels in Australia. There is no wood in this country you can substitute for hickory. Therefore, there is no benefit in increasing a duty unless it is for revenue purposes. </para>

                <para>He says, further, that light buggy wheels will have  to  be imported, whatever  Tate  of duty may  be  charged on them, but that if their cost  be  unduly increased  by  the Customs impost, the demand for light sulkies and light buggies, which are now used so largely in the country districts, will lessen, and many of those who now use them will have to do without them. Furthermore, he informs me that if those employed in carriage building in country towns - and presumably in the cities, too- rare compelled to pay too highly for imported timbers, they must close their works, or make their establishments merely repairing shops- Hickory sulky shafts, on which the duty is now 3s. per pair, will, he says, have to be imported even if the duty is made ros. per pair, because no Australian timber which can be substituted for hickory has yet been discovered. The demand for American hickory is so great that there is difficulty in securing supplies, and consequently its price is rapidly rising. But if, in addition, a high Customs duty has to be paid on it, its use- in Australia will be practically prohibited. With respect to the duty of 5 s. per gallon on Harland&#39;s varnishes, he says that if the rate were <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> they would still have to be imported for the particular kind of work for which they are used: </para>

                        <para>- A number of Australian factories are engaged in the manufacture of varnishes, but my informant, who has had a long experience&#39; in coach building, and particularly in .the making of buggies and sulkies, tells me that the varnishes suitable for the finer kinds of work are not made in the Commonwealth, and must therefore be imported. I do not claim to have any technical knowledge of the subject ; but I feel sure that my correspondent would not make this statement without having good reason for doing so. I trust that when the Tariff is dealt with in detail, the Minister will give consideration to these representations. The old rate on imported timber had the result qf causing local timber to be substituted in heavy vehicles, but it is the general opinion of makers of light vehicles that hickory is essential. Therefore, any duty on it must be regarded, not as a protective tax to cause the substitution of local timbers, but as a revenue tax, and I see no justification for increasing the revenue tax on this article from  20  per cent, to  95, 112,  and even  155  per cent, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem.</inline> When Tariffs are being discussed, there will always be on one side those who wish to impart a strongly protective incidence to them, and, on the other, those who desire* the acceptance of the principle of freetrade. But the Braddon section of the Constitution having made it necessary to raise a certain amount of revenue for Commonwealth purposes, and for distribution among the States, it is impossible for us to have a wholly protective Tariff or to adopt&#62; free-trade. What the Government&#34; appears to have done is to select certain lines1 of manufactures for protection, and to impose prohibitory duties upon goods likely to compete with the output of these indus-i tries, endeavouring to make good the consequent loss of revenue by imposing or increasing duties on articles which cannot <inline font-style="italic">bemade</inline> here, and, but for the need of revenue, would be on the free list.  Hence the Tariff has met with all-round criticism and&#39; general condemnation. When the first draft&#39; Constitution Bill was put before the people of New South Wales for acceptance: they voted against it largely because of the Braddon provision. </para>

                        <para>- At the first referendum, there was in New South Wales a majority for the Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">-Mr. THOMAS</inline> BROWN.- Not the necessary statutory majority. The other States recognised that Federation would be a farce if New South Wales did not join the union, and at a Conference of Premiers, the draft Bill was modified to limit&#39; the operation of the Braddon section for a period of ten years. I have from the outset, both in New South Wales and in this Chamber, emphasized the view that that section has introduced a vicious principle into the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States, and is likely to cause friction and misunderstanding. It is a sound and recognised principle of government that the spending power should* be with those who have the taxing  power -r but under the operation of the Braddon section, the Commonwealth is made the tax-gatherer for the States, and the authorities of the States are thus able to spend money in regard to the raising of which they have no responsibility. Consequently, it&#39; is difficult for a taxpayer to determine whether the authorities of the State or of the Commonwealth are to blame for what he deems to be extravagance. My objection to the Braddon section is as strong to-day as it was at the outset. &#39; In my opinion, the Commonwealth should impose taxation only for its own needs. If its revenue exceeds its needs, it should, still exercise the greatest economy. There should be no boom expenditure. Every proposal for expenditure should be justified, and any surplus revenue should be returned to the States. But the Commonwealth should not be bound by any obligation, such as that in the Braddon section, to impose taxation amounting to 20s., when it requires only 5s. for its purposes. Although this principle has been in force for only some six years, it has been a fruitful source of friction between the States and the Commonwealth. There is a growing disposition on the part of the  States to shirk their responsibilities in connexion with taxation, and to shove those responsibilities on to the shoulders of the Commonwealth Parliament. Hence in my own State - I am not so familiar with the politics of other States - leading politicians, who were strongly opposed to the Braddon section at its inception, and who stumped the country in opposition to it, and were largely instrumental in bringing about the limitation of ten years, are now as enthusiastic advocates of its retention as are any of its original supporters. I do not think I am doing them any great &#34;injustice when I say that those gentlemen have been converted to the principle, not because they have seen reason to alter their opinions in reference to the effect which this section has on legislation, but because it provides an easy -means of raising revenue for the States, while relieving the States Treasurers of the obligation which ought to rest upon them, to provide the funds necessary for the States expenditure. I take this opportunity to state my position in&#34; reference to the Braddon section, and to the proposal which is being urged to give an extended operation to that section of thirty years or more. I now desire to say a word or two about the unfortunate relationship which is springing up between the several States and the Commonwealth Government It must be remembered that the Commonwealth Government and Parliament are not things apart from the States Legislatures, but that both can claim in their particular spheres to be equally representative of the electors. The Commonwealth Parliament owes an allegiance to those electors who have given us the several powers under the Constitution; and it is to those electors that this Parliament must appeal for ratification of its acts. The operations of the Commonwealth Government and Parliament, whether now or in the future, must affect the electors in the various States; and it is in the interests of those electors that there should be no friction between the Commonwealth and the States Governments. Any politician or public man who endeavours to foment friction, and bring about strained relationships between the two governing powers, is no friend of united Australia, and is no friend, ultimately, of those electors whom he endeavours to influence. But there has been a disposition on the part of the States - not one particular State, but all the States, more or less - to treat the Commonwealth with a certain amount of hostility. There has been a disposition to make the Common wealth a chopping-block for the purposes of particular States, and, latterly, the Commonwealth has been used as a means to gain advantage for a particular political&#39; party in a State. In New South Wales, at the present time, there is serious friction between the State Government and the Commonwealth authorities. If the Commonwealth Government are inflicting the great injuries on the State that are alleged - if the Commonwealth Government are treating the State Government in the high-handed and unfriendly manner we have been led to suppose - then I myself and other members, who represent &#34;that S.tat.e, are failing in our duty if we do not challenge the power which is responsible for the wrong. Further, the Federal . Government are not true to Federal principles, or to their duty under the Constitution, in so acting, if the charges can&#39; be sustained. The criticism is. directed not merely against the Government, but against the whole of the Federal Parliament; and each member of this Chamber must take his share of blame if there be any blame. For instance, there is the imposition of a duty on wire-netting, about which so much has been made in. the neighbouring State of New South Wales. It is alleged that it is unconstitutional for the Federal Government to tax State imports, and on that allegation the New South Wales Government base the high-handed action they have taken. I remember that when the first Tariff was. introduced it was proposed to eliminate the taxation on State imports; but, if I mistake not, legal advice was sought, and Parliament, in its wisdom, decided that we were within our rights, and acting fairly to all the States in not differentiating between. States imports and private imports. No doubt there is a constitutional point involved. Originally, when the first Tariff was imposed, we were not in a position to get a definite decision on the point. No High Court had then been constituted ; but a case had been taken to a State Court, and a decision given, the alternative left to the Federal Government being either to appeal to the Privy Council or constitute -a High Court. What was done was to constitute a High Court, which is clothed with power such as, I undertake to say, no other Court in the British Dominions possesses. Like the Supreme Court of the United States of America, it is the custodian and interpreter of our Constitution/and the question raised by the recent occurrences in New South Wale? comes well within its province. Is it the State Government or the Federal Government which should appeal to the Court? It is recognised as a good principle in law that the aggrieved . person is the one who should appeal for the justice he considers is denied him. The High Court has now been constituted over three or four . years, and there has been ample time for any of the States Governments to appeal. New South Wales is not treated differently from the other States in this instance; all the States are in a similar position. The imports of all the States Governments are taxed alike; so that, if there is a grievance, it is one shared by all the States. No State, however, beyond New South Wales, has seen fit to make any protest, and even the Government of New South Wales have paid the duty charges up to the present. Quite recently, however, the people of New South Wales awoke one morning to find the newspapers filled with reports of the extraordinary action of the Premier in going down and seizing by force a large quantity of wire-netting, which had been imported by the State Government for distribution amongst the settlers in the rabbit infested districts. I have here a report of the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> of what took place, and it shows that great prominence was given to the occurrence.

The wharf labourers enjoyed the humour of- the situation, and raised their hilarity to great heights by calling &#34; blackleg &#34; to the Customs officer. </para>

                            <para>- It is largely in the nature of comedy, but it is comedy with an element of tragedy behind it. If this action is going to breed ill-feeling between the States Governments and the Commonwealth Government, it will cease to be a comedy. Why was this extreme action taken by the State Government? It is claimed by the Government - and it is only fair to say so - that the action was taken because it was considered an injustice was being done to the State ; it was considered that the Federal Government were exceeding their constitutional right in charging a duty on the wire-netting. And because the Premier of New South Wales had satisfied himself that his view in this regard was correct, he resorted to this extreme action. </para>

                                <para>- Since the introduction of the first4 Federal Tariff duties have been paid on States imports. The Government of New South Wales is now engaged in a general election. It is fighting for its political life, and no doubt in the heat of a political battle feeling runs high, and sometimes statements are made and actions taken that are subsequently regretted. But the ethics of right and wrong are applicable to political contests, just as they are to the every day relationships of our citizens, and any departure from them is to be condemned. It is alleged that the State Government, in making this theatrical display, was largely actuated by political motives. </para>

                                <para>- I think that the honorable member has some justification for that statement, since the Government did not attempt to take this action until it was in the throes of a general election. Another point. is that it directed its attention to a line of imports which affect a large body of electors, and refrained from taking action with respect to other imports which did not so directly affect the community. In the State political contest which has been waged fiercely in New South Wales for some weeks State issues have disappeared from the forefront, and prominence has been given to &#39;Federal questions. The electors have been invited by the State Government to support an action which , they say, was taken to vindicate State rights. I would remind honorable members that State rights could not be vindicated in that way. The action taken by the Government of New South Wales might appeal to the passions and prejudices of a large section of the community, but even if, as the result of the election, the Ministerial party were returned in overwhelming numbers the question as to the right of the Commonwealth to impose duties on States imports would still remain in the position that it previously occupied. There is a legal channel through which a settlement of the question may be obtained, and there was absolutely no occasion for the theatrical display made by the Premier of New South Wales. A fact worthy of notice is that the State Government confined its attention to one line of goods, although at the time there were in the Customs sheds many other State imports which were dealt with in the ordinary way. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Baxter,</inline> the Acting Collector of Customs in New South Wales, is reported to have made the following statement- </para>

                                <para>- That may be the explanation. A seizure of material required for the Public Works Department, the Railways Commissioners, or the Water and Sewerage Board, would not have appealed to the self-interest of such a large section of. the community as did the seizure of wire netting. This wire netting is not being imported for the purposes of the Government. It is brought out for resale at cost price to settlers all over New South Wales. A large quantity has been so distributed. The Government did not propose to fence in with wire netting the vacant Crown lands of New South Wales, and, as a matter of fact, only a small quantity of wire netting has been used by it to inclose the State experimental farms. </para>

If Customs taxation- could be avoided by such a step, if State imports were beyond the scope  of  Commonwealth taxation, &#34; the uniformity  of  Tariff legislation would be destroyed. In such circumstances, the Government  of  a State where the majority of the people believed in free-trade would simply indent large quantities of general merchandise and re-sell it to the public at cost price. There would be chaos so far as uniformity  of  Tariff legislation was concerned.  No  doubt that is one reason why the Commonwealth holds that States imports must be subject to taxation, just as are private imports. Whilst the action of the Government of New South Wales is supported by many people in that State, many others there take up a more reasonable attitude. When the telegraph wires flashed to the different States the news of what had been done, one of the first public men to express an opinion upon it was the honorable member for Parkes.

                                <para>am pleased to say that whilst in New South Wales, as in other States, great public journals often express extreme political views, and whilst their columns often contain appeals to prejudice and passion, great organs like the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> and  the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph,</inline> which are important factors in the politics of the mother State, have adversely criticised the action of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers,</inline> and have practically told him that he has been guilty of a grave blunder, <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> would further point out. that the friction which has been gradually growing between the States and the Commonwealth has not been brought about by any unfair treatment on the part of the Federation. But unfortunately the Commonwealth seems to be regarded by the States as a  good chopping block. In short, it now occupies a position very similar to that which has long been occupied by the Labour Party. That party has always been held responsible for every evil which has overtaken the body politic. In New South Wales not long since a Commission was appointed to investigate the birth-rate of that State. The result of its labours was the discovery of the Tact that the birth-rate was declining. Of course, the  Labour Party was declared to be responsible for this, until the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> showed that it was not amongst the supporters of the Labour movement that the birth-Tate had declined the most, but amongst their bitterest opponents. That is only a sample of the kind of criticism which is levelled against the Labour Party by a .large section of the community. In Federal matters the Commonwealth Parliament is taking the place of the Labour Party as a convenient scapegoat. If anything goes wrong in the States, the blame is at once attributed to the Commonwealth Parliament. At the present time the question of the land scandals in New South Wales and other considerations are being completely  overshadowed by imaginary grievances against the Commonwealth Government, and by grievances alleged to be due to the imposition of a uniform Tariff. That is unfortunate. To a large extent the present situation is full of the comic element, and this fact seems to have forcibly struck the  police officer under whose&#39; direction the police in New South Wales attempted to remove wire-netting from the control of the Customs authorities; In an interview with that officer which was published on the day following the remarkable action taken at the instance of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers</inline> it is stated - </para>

                        <para class="block">But whilst the situation possesses all the elements of comedy, it also has in it the elements of tragedy. If the present friction is being fomented for purely political purposes, and if at future State elections Federal issues are to be introduced with a view to putting before the electors a false idea of the Federal attitude, the result must be disastrous to a united Australia. If such action does not end in the disintegration . of the union, it will certainly be productive of discord which will be detrimental to sound government. It will leave behind it .a bitter feeling which must operate in the direction of weakening the Federal sentiment, and of reproducing the sad episodes reported from South America, where people who should be one in Sympathy and aspiration are at bitterest enmity with each other. I hope that the Commonwealth Government will deal with the present position in a firm manner. In my judgment the attitude of past Governments in attempting to concili-&#34; ate the States authorities has resulted in the latter becoming very much&#39; like spoilt children, who, if they cannot get their way in every respect, consider that they have a legitimate grievance. The attitude taken up by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers</inline> is not only undignified, but it is derogatory to the maintenance of constituted authority, and only serves to heap ridicule upon the State which he represents. At the present time there are those who say that the Premier of New South Wales is more like a monkey on a stick than a reasonable administrator. I repeat that past Commonwealth Administrations are to some extent responsible for this unfortunate position, in that they have treated the States Governments- with such undue consideration .that the Hatter are now disposed to adopt the <inline font-style="italic">role</inline> of the spoilt child, who &#34; plays up &#34; whenever he cannot get exactly what he wants. I am pleased to know that leading public men in New South Wales, whose- opinions will carry some weight in that State, when the heat of political passion has subsided - men like the honorable member for Parkes and the honorable member for Robertson - have so firmly expressed their disapproval of the action of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers.</inline> I earnestly trust that in the years to come we shall not have any more exhibitions of a similar character. Their tendency undoubtedly is to bring, the State into disrepute, and to strike a blow at the Federation. In the course of his very able address the other evening, the honorable member for Parkes quoted from the utterances of Professor McMillan Brown, who is at present delivering a series of lectures in Sydney. He expressed the opinion that it was very desirable to encourage settlement upon our territorial lands, and to discourage the congestion of population in our large cities. He said that the best type of mankind was produced under rural conditions, and that the cities had to draw their vitality from the country. He further added that he was in favour of any movement which would have the effect of extending -the facilities for establishing in our midst a rural population. Members of the Labour Party have always advocated that principle. It is one of the primary planks of their platform. We believe that Australia will never become truly great whilst its fertile lands and large mineral deposits remain locked up and unexploited, and whilst its population is concentrated in large cities under unhealthy conditions. We welcome the adherence of the honorable member for Parkes to that doctrine. Probably he does not favour the methods by which we propose to achieve our purpose. But what are methods except means to secure an object? If the honorable member has n. better&#39; method for securing that object. I do not think that the Labour Party will quarrel with him in regard to it, because, once the object has been secured, we shall have attained the end for which we have been working. But when the honorable gentleman came to deal with means, he departed from many of the principles which have been laid down by  the Labour Party as essential to the attainment of this end. In the first place, -he -made -the extraordinary statement that the demand for land in New South Wales is not so -large as it appears to be. -He gave it .as a- reason -why settlement has&#39;  npt taken place more quickly, that the public has been taught to think that it should get land very cheaply, and therefore is not prepared to pay the prices asked by private holders which, he considered, not unreasonable. I do not know how he arrives at these conclusions. As a matter of fact, the legislation of the Stale has not made things too easy for the settler. My opinion is that the high prices charged for Crown land, and the harsh conditions insisted upon in connexion with its purchase, have done much to retard settlement. When a man goes into the wilderness, and proceeds to cut out of the forest a home for . himself, he has to expose himself to considerable hardship, and, notwithstanding his great expense of capital and labour, must wait.. -it least five years for a return. But when settlers have to nurse their land, not merely for five, but for ten or fifteen years, they feel the conditions to be such that only those who possess considerable capital can afford to comply with them. In many instances, after men have spent all their capital and most of their lives in trying to make homes in the country, they have failed, and their land has reverted to pastoral occupation. But for years the demand for land in New South Wales has been increasing. Unfortunately, that State, like Victoria, is hide-bound, and the opportunities for obtaining land, either from the Crown or from private holders, are so few that settlement is blocked. The honorable member for Parkes says that the ballots which take place do not represent the legitimate demand for land; but in this connexion the following figures should prove interesting: - When fourteen small blocks, not exceeding 600 acres each, were made available at Brookong, near Narrandera, 1,114 applicants balloted for them. At Molong there were sixty applicants for one block of 650 acres; sixty-one applicants for one block of 700. acres, at a place 25 miles from Wellington; 350 applicants for six blocks in the New England district ; at Port Macquarie, fifty-two applicants for nine blocks; at Corowa, 281 applicants for eleven blocks; at Gobbagombalin, 202 applicants for 145 blocks ; at  Myall  Creek, twenty-two applicants for three blocks, and at Rocky Creek, 296 applicants for eleven blocks. </para>

                        <para class="block">Wales and in Victoria than in other States, because the opportunities for obtaining land under conditions which allow a fair return for the expenditure of capital and labour are restricted in these States, by reason of the large amount of alienation which has already taken place. Whilst in years gone by there was considerable speculation in country land, that is largely prevented by the existing legislation. Every application for Crown land is considered by a Board, and if found to be illegitimate, the money deposited in connexion with it may be forfeited.&#39; Then, again, a single applicant has to give place to a married applicant, and an applicant without capital to an applicant who has capital. These, and other conditions, have largely eliminated mere speculation. But the figures which I have read show that there is a great demand for land, and many disappointed applicants for it. All over the State of New South Wales sons of farmers, who are those best qualified to take up land, find it impossible to get it. They travel throughout the State engaging in ballots, and say that it is as reasonable to hope to gain a fortune in Tattersalls sweeps, as to hope to secure a holding by success in balloting. - The other day, in my electorate, in a district in which&#39; something like  &#163;6,000  was paid to land agents to improperly secure improvement leases, a block of 700 acres of what was considered poor land was made available for settlement, and there were twenty-nine applications for it. A large number of applicants went to the ballot; but an appeal was made against the Board&#39;s ratification to the successful applicant, on the ground that he had not driven in a peg at one corner by a certain time. Ultimately, the question went to the higher Courts, with the result that the appellant was put in possession. I refer to the case to show that, so great is the desire for land, that men will spend money in trying to secure it bv taking advantage of the technicalities of the law. In New South Wales, land  monopoly  has reached very large proportions, and leading economic thinkers say. that the monopoly of land, to a large extent, determines the monopoly of wealth. If land is held in the hands of a few, the wealth of the country must, as a natural corollary, be in the hands of a few. I find that New South Wales has alienated 48,081, ,-{14 acres of her best country lands. Of this area, 11,256,871 acres are held by 69,438 families, the backbone of the country, and  the great producers of its wealth; 13,994,182 acres are comprised in 5,500 holdings not exceeding 10,000 acres each ; and 22,831,261 acres are in the possession of 722 holders; so that nearly half of the alienated area is in the hands of fewer than 1,000 persons. On the other hand, over 500,000 persons who have the right to vote in State and Commonwealth elections, do not possess land. In regard to the possession of wealth, I find, from the latest statistics given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hall,</inline> that the number of persons possessing less than &#163;200 each is 61,286, their accumulations representing ,&#163;5,474,600. The number of those who possess between &#163;200 and &#163;5,000 is 123,695, and their accumulations amount to &#163;110,603,000, while the number of those possessing over &#163;5,000 is 10,853, and their accumulations represent &#163;259,674,000. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hall,</inline> probably half of the accumulated wealth of New South Wales is held by fewer than 3,000 persons, while over 550,000 adults have no interest in the accumulated wealth of the State, which he estimates at &#163;375,752,000, and other competent authorities at &#163;400,000,000. We hear of the great wealth of Australia, and statistics are quoted to show the value of our productions, and of our accumulations per head of population ; but the real prosperity of a community is to be determined by the distribution of its wealth. Notwithstanding the mineral, agricultural, and pastoral resources and potentialities of New South Wales, there are sweated workers in her large cities whose conditions are paralleled only in the larger cities in the old world. In Sydney, at the present time, there are about 1,000 young women and girls employed in shops and factories- for wages of 5s. a week, and less. Some of them are receiving no wages at all, but are living in hopes that when they perfect themselves in their particular industry they may be placed on the wages list. In the Arbitration Court of New South Wales there has been a revelation as to the miserable wages paid to men engaged -in the large retail shops in Sydney. Those men pass hundreds of pounds through their hands every week, and earn much profit for their employers ; and yet they receive the miserable pittance of 30s. or &#163;2 per week, and, if it be the latter sum, they regard themselves as on the top rung. Such are the conditions which obtain in Sydney, and which we, who represent the labour movement, desire to see improved. We wish to see sweating eliminated, and decent wages paid. We feel that so long as land monopoly exists, and so long as the best of our alienated lands is in the hands of so few people, who utilize it for the primitive purposes of running stock, and do not use it to its full capacity, there will be concentration of wealth in the hands of the few, with the result that large numbers of people must live under wretched conditions, approximating to those of the congested centres of the old world. I trust that, as the outcome of humane and just legislation, we shall be able to make this country one in which decent white men can live with advantage and comfort. We trust that Australia will not be a sweaters&#39; country - that we shall not have large numbers of men and women living under sweated conditions, by which they are not only demoralized, but become a menace to -our civilization. I hope we shall endeavour,. by fair and equitable legislation, to improve the conditions of the workers whenever opportunity offers. We have only a limited population in this great country at the present time. There is but a fringe of people along the coast-line ; and there are many miles of territory that is practically very seldom trod by the feet of man, and is in a condition of primitive occupation. We cannot hold this continent under such conditions for any great length of time. Indeed, the surprise is. that we have been able to hold it so long. We can only hold this land on the condition that we fill it with population. If we desire to make Australia a part and parcel of the Empire to which we belong, we must encourage the immigration of people of our own kith and kin. Where is the sense of talking about immigration when we cannot retain our own people - when we cannot provide reasonably and legitimately for the needs of those already, here - when young men and women of our agricultural districts are forced beyond our borders ? If these, people simply removed to other parts &#39;of Australia, there would be no loss to the Commonwealth. But people are in large numbers moving from the central districts of New South Wales to New Zealand, and also to Canada and South Africa. This indicates an unhealthy state of affairs : and to talk about the encouragement of immigration while that state of affairs continues is to delude immigrants and talk bunkum. We must make the conditions such as will invite immigrants. I know there are those who consider that the only immigrants who should be encouraged are those of the manual labouring class, so that when labour is wanted in the factory, in the mine, or on the station, it shall be easy to procure it at a cheap rate. But if such labour cannot be employed for the whole of the year, then a certain burden must fall on the States, and hence it is that we have soup kitchens, labour bureaux, and other forms of Government assistance in slack time. It is to this reservoir of labour th&#39;at employers resort in busy times. Such are not conditions to attract the best classes of labour from the old world to Australia. Such are not the conditions which will keep in our midst men and women who have sufficient enterprise and energy to make the best of life, and if we cannot keep our own people there is no use in introducing the wrecks and cast-offs from -other places. Such a policy, so far from being an advantage, would create new social troubles. The sooner we face this matter as a community, and regard it from a practical stand-point, the better it will be for us. The sooner those who are engaged in Production on a large scale recognise that they owe something to the State, and that their possessions, whether they be in land or otherwise, largely rest on the progress of the community as a whole, and the sooner an endeavour is made to create a population existing on sound industrial lines, the better it will be for all. Therefore, I trust that, as the outcome of the serious consideration which is being directed to social problems in this twentieth century, owing largely to the presence of the Labour Party in politics, we shall discover a solution of the evils I have attempted to describe. Very serious problems face modern civilization, and those problems must be solved. The main problem is presented to us in the slums and in the sweated lives of the masses of men and women, and in the fact that 1,000 people, for example, own half of the best land in New South Wales, while that land is not being put to profitable use. The problem is also represented by the fact that, although New South Wales is a wonderful producer of wealth - one of the largest in the British Dominions - the whole of that wealth is in the hands of less than 200,000 people, no less than 550,000 people having no&#39; lot or part in it. Unhealthy conditions obtain in our cities, and these necessitate soup kitchens and other relief movements, thus leading to a loss of moral stamina and creating a menace to racial progress. If these evil conditions are not improved we cannot expect to hold our own in competition with other races. These barriers to progress which we are transplanting from, the old world are a menace to our civilization, and a disgrace to our Christianity! Such are the problems that face us at the very door of the twentieth century, and our future safety and progress lie in their solution. </para>

                            <para>- - I listened to the Acting .PrimeMinister&#39;s Budget speech with very great attention, and I recognise the difficulties he must have had, not only in preparing that speech, but in deciding, during his absence in England, while engaged on the work of the Commonwealth, on what Tariff to submit to the House. In common with other honorable members, I regret the absence of the Prime Minister, and I am sure that we all hope that he will verv shortly return, restored to health, and able to take his proper place as the leader of the Government. The Acting Prime Minister, in his speech, referred tq the great prosperity which Australia has experienced since the inauguration of Federation. While I am willing to give the Commonwealth Parliament and Government every credit that is due, I do not think that they are entitled to the credit for our prosperity. There is no doubt that since 1902 our progress has been largely due to the fertility of our soil, our abundant sunshine, bounteous rains, the industry of the people, and more scientific methods of cultivation. The honorable member for Calare, on the other hand,- referred to the great poverty which he says is to be found in Australia, and to the consequent establishment of soup kitchens and other relief movements. I do not think the honorable member should have made remarks of that kind, because they are not called for in this country. My opinion is that the bulk of whatever poverty there may be is due to the fact that .there are people who look for work and do not want it when it has been found for them. </para>

                        <para>Mi-. HANS IRVINE. - The people who really know me are not likely to differ from &#34;trie on that point. In my opinion there is very little poverty in Australia,  and, as a matter of fact, it is a difficult matter to. get labour in the back country to-day, either for farming or mining. I cannot understand why the honorable member for Calare should insist that there is extraordinary poverty in a country like Australia, where we have such abundant harvests and such great prosperity. Had the honorable member said that there was great prosperity, but no progress, I should have agreed with him- As a matter of fact, our population has increased <inline font-style="italic">by</inline> less than half a million since Federation ; that  increase is only what we might have expected naturally and without immigration. The fact does not say much for Federation or for our progress; it means that, as a people, we have stagnated. We shall continue to stagnate until we legislate with a view to attracting population, and settling our lands. Australia can never become a great- self-contained country until we have population, and the present Government and its predecessors in office should have legislated to attract it. We have been told that the total revenue received last year by the Commonwealth was &#163;12,832,266, and that our expenditure during the same period amounted to &#163;4,987,301. That appears to be a fairly large outlay, having regard to the revenue actually available for Commonwealth purposes. This year, under the new Tariff, it is anticipated that we shall have a revenue from all sources of about &#163;13,745,200, or an increase of &#163;912,934, which will come chiefly from the primary producer and the consumer. Every man, woman and child in the Commonwealth will have to bear increased taxation to the extent of 5s. per head, and practically the whole of that increased revenue is to be expended on various works. . Our expenditure this year will amount, it is estimated, to &#163;5,967,992, as compared with an expenditure of &#163;4,987,301 during the preceding . twelve months, and will represent about &#163;1,500,000 per 1,000,000 of the population. That is a large expenditure for a limited number of people to be called upon to bear, and it must be admitted that the worker will have to carry the greater part of the taxation necessary to provide for it. On turning to the Estimates we find that there is an increase in respect of the cost of administering nearly every Department. I recognise that it is right and proper that the cost of our services should increase when we are getting value for our money, and are engaged in carrying out reproductive works; but, unfortunately&#39;, the Federation has not yet engaged in any undertaking which is likely to increase our revenue, and so lead to a reduction in the burden of taxation. The Government should make a definite announcement of their policy, and let us know what they propose to do, with a view of encouraging people to settle on the land. We have heard for some time many representations as to the necessity for land settlement, and I have no hesitation in saying that we have in all the States millions of acres pf land available for settlement without resorting to any general taxation proposals such as have been suggested during this debate. There is plenty of land available in Queensland, Western Australia, New South Wales, and South Australia. Even in Victoria, which we are told sometimes could be covered by a pocket handkerchief, there is plenty, of land available for industrious men, and facilities are offered to them to get on to it. </para>

Unfortunately, we do not know what steps the Government contemplate with a view to reduce the incidence of taxation, and to further develop our industries. The passing of the Bounties Bill will mean that this Parliament will be committed practically to a further expenditure of something. like &#163;500,000, with a view to fostering new industries in the Commonwealth. </para>

                                <para>- Quite so. I agree with the proposal made in another place, that we should establish, first of all, a Federal Bureau of Agriculture on lines similar to those on which the Bureau of Agriculture in the United States of America is conducted. Such an institution would enable the people to obtain analyses of the soils and other authoritative information with regard to cultivation and production. It would furnish information as to the crops best suited to the soils of various districts, and its experts would instruct and teach the people what to grow, and how to earner what they produced,, and prepare it for the manufacturer. These are changes which, so  to speak, should go hand in hand with the bounties proposals. I recognise that there are some difficulties in the way, but they are not numerous, and I think that a Federal Bureau could be carried on in conjunction with the States Departments of Agriculture-&#39; The matter certainly requires some consideration, and I think that we should have from the Government some definite announcement on the subject. When the right honorable member for Swan was Treasurer he submitted to the Conference of Premiers at Brisbane a scheme in substitution for the Braddon section. </para>

                                <para>- I recognise that its adoption might interfere with the capacity of this Parliament to provide for great national works yet to be carried out. I realize to the full as I never did as a member of the Legislative Council of Victoria, that the Federation at all times must be paramount. The States must occupy a more or less subordinate position, and the Federal Parliament must enter upon its work in a truly Federal spirit. The sooner we recognise that the better. At the same time, we have to remember that the States in agreeing to federate did not intend to create a master to rule  over them, and do little but place fresh&#39; burdens on the people. We have to remember that the electors of the Commonwealth Parliament are identical with the electors of the States Legislatures, and that whilst the Government are the managers honorable members generally are the directors of the great Commonwealth institution. As directors it is our dutv to instruct the managers, and if they do not attend to the necessities of the  country in  the way which we, as representatives of the people, expect them to do, we have our remedy. Although the Acting Prime Minister said he could not agree with the financial scheme submitted to the Premiers of the States by the right honorable member for Swan, he did not indicate an alternative scheme. </para>

                                <para>- The country expects&#39; him to do so. It is  only  right that the States Treasurers should know what they are to expect from the Commonwealth. The Acting Prime Minister said that the right honorable member for Swan&#39;s scheme was impracticable. If he holds that view, he should tell us what, in his opinion, is a practicable scheme; he ought certainly to submit an alternative proposal. I do not propose to discuss this question at length,  since it has already been dealt with during this debate by other honorable members ; but I desire to say that some at least of the proposals made by the right honorable member for Swan were fair and reasonable. If we are to carry on the duties of Federation, and take over more services from the States, then our expenditure must increase. The tendency of the Government seems to be to take over new services before we are really prepared to administer them. In making this statement, I have in mind more particularly the action of the Ministry in regard to the question of quarantine. There are some matters which might be allowed to remain for a time in abeyance, but there are others that are urgent and necessary. I think it is highly desirable that the Commonwealth  Government should say definitely what are their proposals in regard to the transfer of the debts of the States. During the operation of the Braddon section we have to return to the States three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue, and if at the end of 1910 we take over the debts of the States, nearly the whole of the revenue will be absorbed. </para>

                                <para>- Quite so. . Possibly the States may agree to our taking that step, but I do not think that they will. They need revenue to develop their territories, and it is only right that they should learn, without further  delay,  how the Government propose to proceed&#34; in this matter. It is also expected bv the people that the Government will proceed without delay with the Bill to. provide for the appointment of a High Commissioner, and to establish in London large, commodious, and centrally situated offices. Speaking as a commercial man, I may say at once that I regard the establishment of a Commonwealth office in London as being most essential. It would be a reproductive work. Within the last year or two I have had- an opportunity to see the excellent work done by the Dominion of. Canada in making known its resources to the people of the-  old world. I have been told that Canada-, spends annually some hundreds of thousands of pounds in advertising. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer, when in London, doubtless saw their commodious  offices there. Consignments of produce arrive almost every month from Canada, and are displayed in the Canadian offices. Maps showing lands available for settlement and pamphlets setting forth the facilities for settlement provided by the Dominion Government are also obtainable there, whilst there is on view a model of a steamship showing the class of berths with which immigrants to Canada are provided. Every facility for obtaining &#39; infor- .mation with regard to Canada is offered the people of England, and, as the result of advertisements and lectures in Europe, the Canadian Government have practically doubled their population. Meanwhile, we have been stagnating. The Commonwealth Parliament has had five clear years in which to make an effort to secure an influx of population, but practically nothing has been done. I was glad to hear the Acting Prime Minister the other day refer to this question. He said he was in treaty with the London County Council for a ninety-nine years&#39; lease of a block of land in a central position in London. I know the site well, and would thoroughly approve of its selection. I should be delighted to hear. the Acting Prime Minister announce that the Government had secured a lease of the land, and had decided to erect suitable offices upon it. That is an undertaking which the people of Australia expect the Government to &#39;carry out. After the appointment of a High Commissioner and the establishment of suitable Commonwealth offices in London, the Agents-General of the several States will no longer be necessary. The Commonwealth High Commissioner could have the assistance of experts from the Agricultural Department and the Lands Department of each State, and could make arrangements to give the people of the old land some idea of our mineral, dairying, agricultural, and pastoral resources. Displays could be made of everything that we produce. The Commonwealth offices could, in fact, tx made a miniature exhibition. </para>

                                <para>- I think it is one of the best in London, and, as I said when the Bounties Bill was under consideration, I wish I were in the position to take it myself, with the object of pushing on the industry with which I am connected. I do not think a better site could be secured. Any one who speaks of the necessity of choosing a site in the heart of the city of London does not understand the conditions of the commercial world. After 7 o&#39;clock at night one might discharge a cannon in any of the streets in the heart of London without fear of hitting any one. As a matter of fact, I do not think that one could get a meal there after 8 o&#39;clock at night. We do not want to establish Commonwealth offices in a locality where there are no people. We ought to erect them upon a site near to the theatres - a site which people- will have to pass in Hooking to their amusements. The site suggested by the Acting Prime Minister is an admirable one from that stand-point. If we established our offices there, by means of electric lights and display windows they could be utilized to illustrate to the sightseeing populace of London the resources of Australia. Between 7 p.m. and 11 p.m. tens of thousands of persons pass that particular site. The effect of advertising our resources in the windows of these offices would be te draw attention to the wealth of Australia in a much more striking manner than the Agents-General can direct attention to it. At the present time, one State has an office at Westminster, another in the city, and a third in some other locality. I maintain that a combined display is what we require, if we wish to direct attention to our resources and to attract population. I blame past Administrations for not having stated definitely what they proposed to do in regard to the appointment of a High Commissioner and to the establishment of Commonwealth offices in London. </para>

                                <para>- If that be done, I presume that the erection of &#34;the necessary buildings will occupy two or three years. In the meantime, I suggest that we Ought to lease temporary offices in a central position. An arrangement might then be made with the States Governments for the Agents-General - if the States intend to continue their separate representatives in London - to move into the new buildings when they were completed. Some of the Agents-General of the States are doing excellent work1. In this connexion, I may specially mention the Agents- General of Victoria, New South Wales, and Western Australia. But they, are all working apart from one another. As a matter of fact, there is some jealousy existing between the representatives of the different States in the world&#39;s metropolis. That jealousy ought not to exist. We desire to establish Commonwealth offices in London- offices in which all the Slates will be able to display their products to the advancement of Australian industry. Whilst I thoroughly approve of any proposal in that direction, I should be better pleased if I were informed that the Acting Prime Minister intended to take action. I do not believe in delay, because I hold that it is harmful to Australia. We want more people in the Commonwealth to share our prosperity and our taxation. The conversion of the States debts can better be brought about by the appointment of a High Commissioner. It has been said that in converting the various State loans we shall require to proceed very slowly. Personally, I do not think we ought to experience much difficulty in that connexion. If we could effect a saving of only &#163; per cent, upon our States debts it would be equivalent to  ^600,000  per annum, whilst the saving of &#163; per cent, would represent no less than-  -&#163;1,200,000  annually. Surely some effort should have been made .in this direction ere now. Had a saving of only <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> per cent. been effected upon- our indebtedness during the past five years, it would have represented no less a sum than  &#163;3,000,000  saved to the people. Under such circumstances surely the conversion of these debts was worth accomplishing,  even if we had had to pay a special financial expert to visit the old country, and &#39; endeavour to bring our debenture-holders together. If we had only provided for the transfer of the debts and for converting them when it suited us to do so, we should at.- least have accomplished&#34; something. &#39; I &#39;have no desire to say any more upon this phase of the question, but when the Acting Prime Minister again addresses the Committee I trust that he will give honorable members definite information- in regard to the appointment of a High Commissioner and to the transfer and conversion of the States debts. I hope that he will also inform us as to what he intends to propose in substitution for the Braddon section of the Constitution: Of course it is essential that the States shall know their financial position, otherwise the present feeling of disaffection towards the Commonwealth will increase. &#39; It is our duty to work harmoniously with the States, and to give them no cause for believing that the Commonwealth Government wishes to take advantage of them. I now wish to say a few words in regard to the Tariff proposals of the Government. As a protectionist I have seen the benefits accruing from a protective policy, and I have also witnessed the evil effects of free-trade. But if I cannot get all I want, I intend, upon the principle that half a loaf is better than no bread, to take what I can get. There is no doubt that throughout the Commonwealth the people at the last election pronounced themselves in f avour of protection. But they did not declare themselves in favour of a prohibitive Tariff, and I do not intend to support one. During my recent campaign I did not address a single meeting at which I did not say that I would support an effective measure of protection, but would oppose prohibitive protection. That is the attitude that I intend to adopt towards the Tariff. </para>

                                <para>- Certainly. We must not unduly tax the primary&#39; producer or consumer. On the contrary, we must give every person an inducement to better his position in life. It is the desire of every man to improve his position, not merely for his own sake, but for that of his family. I have seen the evil effects of prohibitive protection in America and on the Continent.  Our population being small, I can only characterize the prohibitive duties proposed by the Government as absurd. The highest duties that I intend to support are those which have . been recommended by the protectionist, section, of the Tariff Commission, and even some of these I think ought to be reduced. I trust that the &#39;Government will endeavour, to remove the uneasy feeling which exists throughout. Australia that they are attempting .to take advantage of their opportunity to add to the burdens of the people..&#39; I am satisfied that that was not their intention, in framing this Tariff. They desired to merely assist the establishment of further industries. But I would point out&#39; that they are proposing to still further protect industries which are already iii a  flourishing condition. Our woollen mills are. actually .refusing orders, and vet the Government propose to assist them by the imposition of duties upon their  products ranging from  40  to  45  per cent. I trust that the Ministry will withdraw any. proposal to impose higher duties than those which have been recommended By the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission. As I have already stated, in some cases even those duties are too high. If the Ministry will act in the way that I suggest they will gain, not only my hearty support, but that of many other honorable members who view this question through the same glasses. I know that they desire to make Australia a self-contained community. But we cannot accomplish that if we erect prohibitive barriers around our shores before we have a sufficient population to bear the burdens imposed upon them. If we desire prohibitive protection, we must proceed slowly, as Germany and America did. Their protective Tariffs are prohibitive, but those countries are self-contained, the former having a population of 60,000,000, and the latter of 80,000,000. Those countries did not erect their high protective walls immediately. They started with a small wall, and gradually increased its height. </para>

                                <para>- Those duties were sufficiently increased when we federated. Our population, on the other hand, cannot be said to have increased. The Attorney-General will be at liberty to talk as much as he pleases when I have concluded my remarks. If I am not talking common sense, I am quite open to correction. I repeat that I have seen the evil effects of free-trade in Great Britain, and I consider that the adoption of that policy &#39; would prove a curse to the Commonwealth. We must secure effective protection, but we must not adopt a prohibitive Tariff. That is why I am opposed to the Government proposals. </para>

                                <para>- But there is a difference between effective protection and prohibitive protection. I hope that the Government will recollect that a limited population, such as we have in Australia, cannot continue to bear the burdens which this Tariff imposes upon it. Let us use our best endeavours to direct the attention of the old country to our resources. Let us stimulate industry, but do not let us do so by means of prohibitive duties, which can only result in the creation of trusts. In passing, I may mention that when I was in . California two years ago I visited some of the large tinning factories there. &#39; During one of these visits, I inquired, &#34; How is it that such exorbitant prices are charged by the stores for all those tinned goods?&#34; The reply which I received was, &#34; We make the prices. We have a combine, the members of which meet together with a view of ascertaining how many tins of fruit each will be putting up during the year. This year we find that the &#39; output will be about 50,000,000 tins, and as our home consumption amounts to 35,000,000 tins, we shall1 have 15,000,000 tins to burn - that is, to dump in free foreign ports.&#34; <inline font-style="italic">Sitting</inline><inline font-style="italic">suspended</inline><inline font-style="italic">from 6.30 to 7.45 -p.m.</inline></para>

                                <para>- I saw canned fruit which, in California, was retailed at half-a-dollar, sold in London for 10d. These facts show that a country does not benefit by prohibitive protection; that the result of prohibition is to build up combines, monopolies and trusts, which exploit the people who are taxed for their benefit. In America there is also a strong iron and steel combine, which manufactures largely in excess of American requirements, selling the surplus chiefly to Great Britain for less than is charged to American manufacturers. Some persons say that that is the salvation of England, but, in my opinion,, it is detrimental to the interests of many English workers, who, for lack of effective protection, find it difficult to obtain employment. I am in favour of effective protection, but opposed to. prohibition. </para>

                                <para>- The ideas of Ministers differ from mine as to what is effective protection. Duties of 100, 200 and 300 per cent, on manufactured articles, and of 10, 15, and 20 per cent, on raw materials, are higher than merely effective protective duties would be. If Ministers had adopted the recommendations of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission, I could have fallen into line with them, but I am opposed to the Tariff as it stands. &#39; When in London, I, saw sold, wholesale, at 2d. a lb., singed Canadian bacon, which costs; more ,than ordinary cured bacon, and is worth 5d. a lb. wholesale where it is manufactured. If Great Britain had a duty or* bacon, her consumers might have to pay more for it, but more work would be given- to her people. We ought to try to encourage industries here, but we should do what we can to prevent .the building up of monopolies and combines. </para>

When our population has doubled or trebled, we may perhaps raise our barriers, which, in the first place, should not be higher than is reasonable, and when we become a nation of  30,000,000  or  40,000,000  we may, if we like, adopt the policy of prohibition, as America and Germany have done. </para>

We must protect our industries, but we ought not to unduly increase the cost of living to our consumers, or handicap our primary producers. If we have prohibition, trusts and combines will spring up. In America the supply of almost everything except fresh air is controlled by trusts and combines, and in New York, because of the huge sky-scrapers that tower twenty and thirty stories high, even fresh air is difficult to obtain. </para>

                                <para>- There are combines almost everywhere. We wish to&#34; keep them out of Australia. If we adopt prohibition, legislation will be useless to prevent the growth of combines. The honorable member for Hindmarsh has stated that the Excise legislation passed last Parliament to regulate the price of harvesters has been ineffective. What we must do is to prevent the birth of combines. The Tariff Commission spent  2j  years in travelling from one capital to another, examining witnesses to obtain all the information available in regard to the operation of the last- Tariff, and the needs of our manufacturing industries. The Government might have been expected to fix the rates of duty in accordance with the recommendations of that body, which were based on solid reasons. Unfortunately they have not done so. When I heard the Acting Prime Minister say that it was intended to give Great Britain a preference, I thought the proposal a wise one, because, we owe so much to the old country. With out the protection of her flag, under which we are proud to live, the Japanese, the Germans, or some other people might take possession of our territory, which we find it so difficult to settle. I find, however, that in regard to the bulk of the goods which we import wholly from Great Britain, no preference is given, and that the difference of  2j  and  s  per cent, between the British and foreign rates in many cases is merely a nominal preference. </para>

                                <para>- Great Britain should receive a reasonable preference in recognition of the fact that it is to her protection that we owe our liberty and freedom. We might well give a preference also to Canada, South Africa, and New Zealand. I should like to see the principle of Imperial preference adopted, and based on broad lines, without any huckstering for reciprocal benefits. We shall get reciprocity sooner or later, because the world wants our goods; but if we erect prohibitory barriers against importation, we may find barriers erected to keep our exports out of other countries. </para>

                                <para>- Undoubtedly ; but it is ridiculous to talk of duties of  45  per cent, against the foreigner, and  40  per cent, against British goods, when the particular goods are supplied by Great Britain, as giving a preference to British manufacturers. Such duties give no advantage to British manufacturers, and unduly tax our consumers and primary producers, who are the backbone of the country. I should like Ministers to know that the country is opposed to the imposition of excessive duties. I have always been a protectionist, and think, as many others, including <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain,</inline> do, that if England does not soon adopt protection, she will decay, instead of remaining progressive and prosperous. But even under the late Tariff, although we were prosperous, we did not progress. As I pointed out earlier in the evening; the population, since the inauguration of Federation has increased by 400,000 odd, but that is only a natural increase, and not an increase by immigration. Surely some progressive policy will be announced by the Government in order to remedy, the present stagnation. We all desire prosperity, but with prosperity there ought to be progress. The more people we have to divide the burden of taxation and share our prosperity, the better for the country. </para>

                                <para>- I think that a few years ago the honorable member was a working man himself ; and if other working men adopted the same industrious methods as he has done, they would become land-owners also. There is any amount of land available for industrious men; and in any of the capital cities of Australia may be found persons willing to finance men who wish to become freeholders. I have had ari experience of farming on a fairly Urge scale, and also of other industries, so that I am not speaking without knowledge.&#39; I had fully expected that the Government would! earlier have &#39; announced that if, in the opinion of honorable members, the Tariff placed before us was too high, they would be willing to adopt more reasonable duties, approaching the recommendations of the Tariff Commission. Had such an announcement been made, this debate would not have been so prolonged ; but I recognise that the discussion has done good, because it has given us time to consider the Tariff, to ascertain the anomalies, and to realize that the proposed increases of duty are too high. If, when we get to work on the details, we can arrive at what is fair effective protection, I have no doubt that many of the items may be passed <inline font-style="italic">in globo.</inline> I desire to say, however,  that I shall, oppose the prohibitive protective proposals of the Government. I do not desire to discuss the items now, but I must say that we ought not to ruin the mining industry in Western Australia, for instance, by imposing too high duties on mining machinery. </para>

                                <para>- I have had experience of various classes of machinery ; and I have always endeavoured to obtain the local article in preference to the imported article, or the British article in preference to the foreign article. That has been my rule of trade always; and if I could get machinery made in Australia which would do its work effectively, I would take it, even if it cost 20 per cent. more. The honorable member may know all about his own business, but I am afraid that he does not know much about mining machinery, electrical machinery, or portable engines. There are numerous classes of machinery the manufacture of which is not even attempted in Australia. If I were to discuss the Tariff now, I .could point out many anomalies, as I hope to do when we reach the details. My wish is to bring about reasonable reductions in the proposed duties, so that they may not be oppressive to the worker. </para>

                                <para>- I have had a large &#39;and varied experience - possibly a larger experience than that of the honorable member. I speak as an Australian  native, who was born in Melbourne, but who has a knowledge of the Australian States. As to the friction which there may be between the States and the Commonwealth, the Government should, as far as possible, endeavour to allay the feeling of discontent which is now observable in the large centres of the Commonwealth. The people . desire to know their position, and the Treasurers of the various States also desire to know what the policy of the Commonwealth Government is in regard to the Braddon section, the conversion of the debts, and so forth. We should no longer pursue an indefinite policy of increased taxation and procrastination. We should not pursue a policy of spend all and save nothing, but a policy which will tend to make the country more progressive. We are prosperous enoueh, thanks to our own industry and our magnificent climate and soil ; but we can never become a nation unless we increase our population. In my opinion the Government make &#39;a mistake in attempting to erect a high fiscal barrier before we are a self-contained people. What I desire is a reasonable and effective protectionist policy, . and I hope the Government proposals will be such that I hall be able to support them. I hope the Government will recognise the feeling  there is throughout &#34;the country in regard to the Tariff, and that they will acknowledge the work being done by the primary producer. I speak to-night for the purpose of explaining my position, so that the Government may not rely on my vote unless they are prepared to amend their proposals. I am in sympathy with the object of the Government, as every protectionist must be. I speak as a producer and a manufacturer , and as such&#39; I desire efficient protection. But prohibitive protection is bad for the producer as well as for the consumer. If we have excessive protection, it will mean what it meant in the boot trade in Victoria in years gone by. At that time many of the boot workers were practically starving, through excessive competition, and though </para>

                        <para>We have wages boards now to protect the workers, if there is over production we cannot export our boots to England. The same remark applies to almost every industry. I recognise that many manufacturers desire extra protection, so that the may make more profit, and further exploit  the consumer. At the same time, the Government, possibly wisely, have thought that if the protection be increased, it will enable other manufacturers to be established, and so promote sufficient competition to do away with present monopolies. In the course of this debate I heard an honorable) member refer to the bottle business, about which I happen to know a little. In view of the evidence I have received from wine and spirit merchants and others in New South Wales and Victoria,I do not think that that honorable member made out a case. In my opinion the old duty was sufficiently, high, and, Indeed, the same may be said of dozens of other items in the Tariff. My idea was that the Tariff Commission was appointed to remove anomalies, anil not to increase taxation ; but the Government have deemed it expedient to propose largely increased duties, and against those duties I shall have to vote. I hope, however, that Ministers will afford me an opportunity to support them, because, as I said before, my sympathies are with them, although not with any proposals for prohibitive protection. </para>

                                <para>- I was always as good a protectionist as the Acting Prime Minister. I do not think it necessary to say. more at the present stage. I have given the Government an opportunity to avail themselves of my support, and I hope they will take advantage of my offer. I feel sure that many honorable members in this corner desire to support the Government in their desire for protection; and I hope and believe that. I have so explained myself to-night&#39; as to make my position clear. </para>

                            <para>. - I have listened with some interest to the speech of the honorable member for Grampians, and while I agree with him that there is prosperity throughout Australia to-day, I certainly disagree with his statement that there is very little poverty to be found. If the honorable member desires to see poverty he has only to go round his own city; and  his expressions of opinion to-night only prove the truth of the statement that one naif of the world does not know how. the other half lives. In Adelaide the poverty cannot be seen in an ordinary walk round the city, but it is there all the same ; and I am sorry to say that we shall always have poverty with us so long as the present sweating conditions obtain in some of our industries. I do not desire  to speak further on that phase of the question at the present time. I was rather amused to hear the honorable member for Grampians say that the Government had his sympathy in regard to protection. I am very much afraid that though the Government has his sympathy,  the Opposition will receive his% vote. The honorable member is the most curious mixture of a protectionist I have ever come across; and what his protective policy is I cannot make out. He has talked for a whole hour, during which he has told us that he desires to have effective protection - which will not be too high, and which will show consideration &#39;to the consumer, the manufacturer, and every. body else. </para>

Personally, I do not know much about bottles, though I once had the pleasure of making one. Whether that bottle turned out to be a good one or a bad one, I do not know ; but I have since endeavoured to collect some information in regard to the manufacture, with the result that in my opinion bottle makers are not afforded sufficient protection. I am going to help the Government to make the Tariff an effective one, and to make it effective we must have fairly high protection for everything that we can produce in Australia.

I am satisfied that the position &#39; will be the same in regard to machinery generally. When the leader of the Opposition spoke last week he expressed his grave concern that a Ministry with only ten supporters in a Parliament of in members should occupy the Treasury benches. He said that the centre of gravity was not in the right place, because the Labour Party .really exercised the power to legislate, although without responsibility. The Labour Party have no desire to shirk their responsibility.. They are ready to take up the administration&#39; of the affairs of the Commonwealth as soon as they find in . this House a majority&#39; prepared to support them. . We ought, rightly, to have a supporter in the honorable member for Paramatta. He told&#39; the Committeee the other night that the Labour Party was far more effective in its present position than it was when it occupied the Treasury benches. </para>

                                <para>- It is usually said that we are prepared to resort to all sorts of wild schemes, but I hope that we shall always refrain from - taking action until we are, as the honorable member suggests, sure of our ground. It is incorrect for the leader of the Opposition to say that the Labour Party cannot act independently - that we act always as a brigade. The right honorable member takes advantage of every opportunity, both in this House and outside, to misrepresent our party. I like fair fighting, and have no desire to misrepresent the Opposition or its leader. If it be true that we always act as a brigade, how is it that we are so often found divided? We did not vote so solidly for the Parliamentary Allowances Bill as did the Opposition. </para>

Every representative who is an honorable man should do so; but the difference between our party and others in the House is, that we put our pledges in black and white so that we cannot wriggle out of them. I have known honorable members of other parties to experience no difficulty in getting away from their pledges. So far as questions not included in our programme are concerned, we have power to act as &#34; our consciences and judgment dictate, and we do not fail to do. so. I should not remain two days in this House if I could not exercise my independent judgment. </para>

I come row to the Tariff, with regard to which I do not propose to say much until we reach the schedule. I admit, as others have done, that it is far from being perfect. In some instances it presses very heavily upon the poorer classes of the community, whilst not providing for more employment by the extension of manufactures. </para>

                                <para>- I am. I know also that it is said that the cost of producing and refining kerosene in America is less than id. per. gallon. If that be so, we have here a magnificent field for the production of&#39; kerosene at an enormous profit, even if four times the wages paid in the United States of America be received by those engaged in the industry here, and I fail to see why any protection should be necessary. Kerosene is used only by the producing class and the poorer sections of the community. Those in better circumstances may use gas, electric light, acetylene, and other illuminants, and I am not going to join with others in penalizing the poorer classes of the community. I do not represent producing interests, and therefore, unlike many other honorable members, I have not to &#34; trim &#39; &#39; on this question. I recognise, however, that our producers, for the most part, use kerosene, and in their interests as well, as in the interests of the poorer classes in the cities and towns, I shall oppose the impost. If the statements that I have heard with regard to the production of kerosene in Australia be true - if it be true that we can supply the world with it - then there is a magnificent opening for the industry. The moment kerosene can be produced, here at a fair price, and it is shown that a combine is underselling the local men, I shall be prepared to assist in crushing that combine. I should hot like to adopt the outrageous abortion that has been put forward in the name of a Tariff by so-called free-traders. I have no hesitation in saying that the Tariff recommended by the free-trade section of the Commission would raise as much, if not more, revenue than will the Tariff submitted by the Government: It has been referred to by the Opposition as a freetrade Tariff; it is really a revenue one, and; therefore, most objectionable to both free-traders and protectionists. It was recommended because direct taxation is coming nearer and nearer. T,he number of honorable members irb favour of such taxation is steadily increasing, and what is still more important, we are approaching a time when we shall have to raise more revenue. In these circumstances the free-trade section of the Commission recommended a revenue Tariff to stave off direct taxation. </para>

                                <para>- I am delighted to hear it, and feel confident that if the present members of the Opposition before long are not advocating it, others will be taking their places. The proposals of the free-trade section of the Commission are designed to raise revenue without protecting Australian industries. With such a Tariff I shall have nothing to do. The honorable member for Grampians said that we ought to build up a Tariff by degrees, and, as the Attorney-General very properly interjected, if that be so, we ought to add one more brick to the Tariff wall. I hope, however, that we shall pass a Tariff that -will stand for at least twenty years, so that our manufacturers and business people will know exactly where&#39; they are. </para>

But before dealing with that matter, I wish to make some observations upon the principle which was embodied in the Excise Tariff Act of last year. I refer to what is known as the new protection. I maintain that we should know how this principle is working, what effect it has upon our employers and employes, and how the Government have administered the Act. As honorable members are aware, it was .understood that an increased duty upon agricultural machinery was to be levied conditionally upon our local manufacturers paying their  employes  fair wages. In order to decide what constituted fair wages, provisions were inserted in the Excise Tariff Act of  1906,  which read - </para>

                        <para class="block">The Act should have been made to embrace the conditions, as well as the remuneration, of labour. It doe&#39;s not leave room for dealing with the question of apprentices, with the hours of labour, or with the. employment of women. When it was put into operation some employers in South Australia at once applied to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> O&#39;Connor, the  President  of the Arbitration Court, for exemption from the payment of Excise&#39;. In New South Wales, where the first exemption was granted, the employes in the industry had no knowledge that such an application was being made. After having looked into the regulations, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> O&#39;Connor forwarded to South Australia an intimation requiring employers to post in their workshops, for seven days prior to their applications being made to. the Court, a notice of their intention to apply for exemption from the payment of Excise. He also directed that any employ6 who was dissatisfied with the wages which he was receiving should be at liberty to complain to his employers, and to lodge a complaint with the Court. Messrs. Bagshaw and Sons were amongst the first employers in South Australia to apply for exemption. Had an employe ventured to complain that he was receiving insufficient wages, I do not hesitate to say, not only that he would have been dismissed, but that he might have found it difficult to obtain employment at his occupation in the State, or even in the Commonwealth, because he would have been black-listed. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> O&#39;Connor&#39;s order was received, I at once communicated with the Minister of Trade and Customs, pointing out the injustice of the latter portion of it, and asking that where there was an association of employe&#39;s that association should be permitted to appear before the &#39; Court and to act for the whole of the employes in the trade. &#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fairbairn.</inline> - What evidence has the honorable member of that? </para>

A subsequent examination of their balance-sheet disclosed that they had made a profit of  ^4,-975  upon a capital&#39; of  &#163;25,000,  or about  20  per cent., notwithstanding that the head of the firm and one nephew were  receiving <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline> 10s.  a week each, and another nephew <inline font-style="italic">&#163;4.</inline> 10s.  a week. </para>

They put forward a fine big German, of thirty-eight years of age, who, working as a labourer, declared that he was receiving  6s. . <inline font-style="italic">6d.</inline> per day. That. I contend, was a miserable wage for him &#39;to be paid. I am glad to say that in South Australia we pay .our builders&#39; labourers  8s.  a day. But the -representatives of the union knew precisely .what the man had been getting, and when their counsel questioned the witness in regard to the matter he had to admit that he had only just received an increase from  5s.  10d. per day <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> O&#39;Connor thereupon said - </para>

                        <para class="block">The  President  of the Arbitration Court could see that this witness had to come- forward and give whatever evidence his employers asked Kim to tender. At that time mo wage had been fixed ford the different branches of the trade. Accordingly the employes met and drew up a scale of wages, which they submitted to their employers. When the latter went before the Arbitration Court there was no agreement &#34;between them and their employes as to the wages which should be paid, and, accordingly, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> O&#39;Connor suggested that the parties should confer together. They did so. When the association of employes was formed the employers not only permitted <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> to address them during working hours, but they declared that they were willing to help the association. When the conference between the parties was held, the employers gave a guarantee that no workman would be penalized for any part that he might take in that gathering, or for any action that he might take before the Court. What followed? The parties&#39; arrived at a satisfactory agreement as to the wages that should he paid. Upon 4th June last <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> O&#39;Connor declared that he was perfectly satisfied with the arrangement, and accordingly he made the agreement arrived at the&#39; award of the Court in eighty-one cases. The Court ordered that, provided these employers were paying the rate of wages specified in the industrial agreement, they should be exempt from the payment of Excise j but that if the agreement were departed from they should, pay the Excise. Honorable members heard the Minister of Trade and Customs tell me yesterday that,&#39; so far, no Excise had been collected in South Australia. I want to know the reason why it has not been collected. This is a most important experiment. It is one the results of which honorable members should be fully acquainted with before they are called upon to deal with a single item in the Tariff, because a similar .principle ought to be applied to every branch of industry. Strong protectionist though I am, I say that unless the workers are to obtain a fair  share of the protection which it is proposed to extend to the manufacturers, I shall favour allowing the workers and the consumers to purchase their goods as cheaply as possible. It has often been said that there is always poverty in protectionist countries. That fact, I contend, is not the fault of protection, but rather of the want of protection. It has been too long a case Oi free-trade in flesh and blood with the manufacturers and of protection for themselves. </para>

Either, the temporary occupant of the office, during the absence of the ex-Minister of Trade &#39; and Customs in England, knew nothing whatever about the provisions of the Act, or he has failed to administer it.  I  do not care which is the correct position. The matter is so important  that  I  shall tell the Committee exactly what has happened.  I  have a list of the names here, but  I  am sorry that it is not complete. &#39;  I  know&#39; that some firms are loyally carrying out the . agreement. </para>

They are friends of mine, and when  I  asked if they thought that .a fair wage to pay to competent artisans, they replied &#34; No,&#34; but that other firms, were paying less.  I  knew., too, that they were doing all that they could to teach boys their trade, which other firms were not doing. They said to me, &#34; If we were put on the same footing as other firms, we should pay higher wages,&#34; and they have loyally done so since. Messrs. C. H. Smith, of Ardrossan ; Shearer, Kilkenny and Mannum ; J. F. Mellor, S. Perry, J. W. Jones, Hawke and Co., Kapunda, C. F. Linke J. L. Campbell and others have all loyally paid the wages agreed upon. But can the Government give any reason why those employers who have not obeyed the award of the Court have not been punished ? </para>

A copy of the letter was forwarded to the Customs Department, and another copy given to me. It was written by the secretary, under instructions from his association, and is as follows - </para>

                            <para>Very few indeed were given the &#34;average capacity &#34; wage. Every labourer without exception was classed as &#34;not used to the trade 6s. 6d.&#34;, although many of them are excellent men, who have been in their employ for many years. Only a few men declined to sign, and these had to go. We think you will be able to understand the position of a workman alone in the office with an employer having to decide immediately whether he will accept an unjust classification, or whether he will chance securing work elsewhere. Most of the men have wives and families dependent upon them. </para>
                            <para>Messrs. J. S. Bagshaw and Sons Limited, dismissed one man (a sheet iron worker) because they thought he gave our Secretary information about the skill required for his work when we were fixing wages. This man did not give the particulars about the work he did, they charged him with doing so, and would not take his word or refer the matter to our Secretary, but dismissed him. They did this the morning after the evening the wage was settled, the line &#34;Sheet-iron workers&#34; was called on by the employers before tea, but as J. A. Bagshaw wanted the rate fixed very low and made out that no skill was required our Secretary asked for the item to be left out until after tea, and during the interval he procured full particulars from a recent departmental foreman, who had started in business for himself the week previously.  Messrs. J. S. Bagshaw and Sons Limited also dismissed the shop steward of the union (the man who collects members&#39; contributions) at the end of the same week, without notice, and declined to give him a reference,, although he had been in their employ twenty-five years, and his recent foreman and his fellow workers testify that he is a good tradesman. He is a most inoffensive man, and would not say an ill word against the firm. He is a man of great forbearance, and did not wish us to say anything about his treatment ; he said God would punish them. </para>

The  Chairman  had called for a report from each shop. Another employe&#39; of Messrs. Bagshaw and Sons who was present told the firm the next day of what transpired, and both these men who had spoken were dismissed that day. </para>
                            <para>On Friday last, July  5,  another employe&#39; (of the same firm) who had lately become Treasurer of our Association was dismissed. No one can understand why he was put off unless it was on account of his connection with the union. Probably it was because I had been sending notices to him by post of our meetings, and the firm recognised my writing on the envelopes, and p&#39;erhaps because he was our Treasurer.,. This man is a very quiet reserved man, he thinks he was put off on account of the letters being addressed to him, the man who was foreman over him until he started  for-  himself a month ago speaks highly of &#39; him and says he  works hard all -day, &#34; and will&#34; not speak, unless spoken to, and he thought he would be appointed foreman of his department when he left. The shop-steward who was dismissed was also entitled to the fo&#39;remanship of his department - in the opinion of the other foremen and workmen. When a man applies for a position now this firm requires him to answer a number o&#39;f questions and they record the answers. Some o:f the questions are as follows: - &#34;Unionist or&#39; Non-unionist.&#34; &#39;.&#39; Where worked last.&#34; &#34;Why released.&#34; &#34; Have you any references,&#39;&#34; and . &#34;How many-&#34; and &#34;Who from.&#34; &#34; Have_ you any relations in other factories&#34; (Is this to identify unionists and keep a &#39;black list?). &#34;Where served time&#34; (this from a firm who try to make out that they do not require  skilled men) &#34;Where educated&#34; &#34;Nationality&#34; *&#39; Occupa-tion &#34; &#34;Age,&#34; &#34; Married or Single.&#39;! </para>

When they started again after shut- ting down for a few days they did not re-engage the secretary of our Gawler branch, nor the shop-steward, nor treasurer, nor delegate to our first conference.

A condition of the agreement! is that&#39; their term of employment may be terminated any day. It is therefore evident there is no desire or obligation to teach such youths a trade extend.ing over a term of&#39; five years. Striking is not a. trade, it is labourer&#39;s work, and the wages agreed upon at conference is 7s.&#39; 6d: per day, the same- as for labourers used to the trade, those who think themselves worth 7s. 6d. although&#39; under 21 may demand that rate and: leave if they do not get it, the great majority of strikers under 21 will be- content to be classed as &#34; youth labourers.&#34; We would like your, decision on the above matters. </para>

                                <para>- Yes, and he got. it on condition that the Minister carried out his part of the bargain. We must remember that we have to consider the .revenue of. the country, and that this sort, of evasion cannot be permitted. I may say that Messrs. Brebner and Keefe are not carrying out the agreement; and -I&#39; should like to know what the Minister proposes to do in the matter. This legislation was a. new  experiment ; and we were justified in expecting the Government to see that it had a fair and proper trial, and that honorable members were informed as to the result. That has not been done; and the responsibility, therefore, is not with the House but .with the Ministry.  </para>

There is no doubt, however, that some method to insure fair wages and conditions of labour must be adopted. The fixing of prices bristles with difficulty. </para>

                                <para>- Not if I can help  it.  As honorable members know, the Labour Party have been considering a scheme, the details of which have not yet been worked out, but which was outlined by the honorable member for South Sydney  in  his speech the other night. Under that scheme, we think that it will be possible to affix a Commonwealth trade mark and duty stamp, just as easily as other revenue stamps are affixed ; and .if we can get a Minister who will carry out the policy I do  not  anticipate any .difficulty. No doubt the scheme has one great weakness. Manufacturers are not required to take any notice of the law, unless there is some one to see that it is carried out ; and&#39; if the Minister does not  &#39;Undertake  that duty, we shall only penalize every fair employer without doing the employes any good. However, that is  a  difficulty in the removal of which I trust we shall have the assistance of legal members of this House. Although we may pro-  te(:t the manufacturer .and the employe, ft must be remembered that there, is such a variation in the classes and qualities of goods that it may be impossible to fix prices to the consumer; but I believe that when the -employes are on an equal footing .competition will fix prices. </para>

                                <para>- I believe we are coming to Socialism in regard to some industries ; in any case, we must make the provision that is .necessary in the interests of  all  concerned. I am glad  to  say that, ever since I have been in Australia,  now  for twenty-three years, all apprentices to. the printing trade, to which I belong, have had to be bound. I have had under me several apprentices who are now doing well <inline font-style="italic">y</inline> some in South Australia, and one in South Africa ; but I am sure they would not have done nearly as well if they, had been employed by any of the manufacturers of agricultural implements to whom I hav&#187;- referred. We must deal with wages and the apprentice question; because there must be skilled workmen, or there will be some ground for the statement of the honorable member for Grampians that we cannot &#39;turn out machinery as well as it can be turned out in other countries. Personally, I was bound an apprentice for seven years, and all who enter the printing trade have to serve at least six years ; and that is good for both the trade and the boys. We have also to lay down conditions for manufacturers who employ girls. Under all the -circumstances, there must be some kind of tribunal, because -we cannot possibly leave the Minister to see that the Act is properly carried out. </para>

                                <para>- I think so; and that is why I called for the return to which I have . referred, and which would have been of much assistance to us. There is another industry which shows the necessity for some kind of tribunal. According to the Tariff, it is proposed to give increased protection to makers of bicycles; and yet I see that the Wages Board in Victoria has actually fixed the minimum for an adult in this trade at 27s. 6d. a week. I am not going to vote protection, for any manufacturer who says that an adult is worth only 27s. 6d. per -week. We are told that the crying need of Australia is a larger population. Surely we ought to be prepared to provide that every man shall receive a wage on which he may support a wife and family. I should be sorry if any acquaintance of mine were to marry some poor girl at a time when he was receiving&#39; only 27 s. 6d. a week. I should tell him what I thought of him. For the protection of our race, we must prevent the. payment of unreasonably low .wages. It is simply scandalous that- in any Dart -of the Commonwealth there should exist a Board prepared to find that 27 s. 6d. is a reasonable wage for an adult. </para>

                                <para>- I have ridden a good many thousands of miles, on a bicycle put together in Australia, the tubing alone having been imported, . and I could not wish for a better machine. I believe in patronizing, as far. as possible, &#39;local industry,, and, provided, that it be satisfactory, am prepared to pay a little more for an Australian article than I should have to pay for an imported one. In my opinion,; we can turn cut the best of everything. I. have never had a better suit than that : which I am now wearing, and it; is made of . South Australian tweed.&#39; Owing to the action of the Labour Premier of South. Australia., the local tweed factory&#39;s output has. been increased by  40  per cent. . <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.. Price-,,</inline> on platform after platform, has urged the people to support local industry, and this is one result of his effort. If our- free-trade friends would not cry&#34; stinking -fish &#39;.&#39; so often-if they were prepared to stand . up for our manufactures, . our industrial position would be improved. </para>

                                <para>- Protection will undoubtedly establish various &#39;industries, and they will expand as soon as we encourage them. -For- want of encouragement half the looms in the South- Australian factory year after- year remained idle. Such a state of affairs&#39; is due largely to the; fact that so many people are prepared to decry the productions of their own &#39; country.. There is one class of manufactures to . which I am not in favour of granting protection. I refer to flannels&#39;. In the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of  23rd  January,  1906-  and I have no reason . to doubt this statement - there appeared a paragraph&#39; giving the analyses of imported, and Victorian-made flannels. I . regret&#39; to say that it was shown&#39; that out of twenty samples of Victorian flannel only five consisted wholly of wool, the rest being adulterated &#39;with&#39; from&#34;  26  to  58  . per cent, of cotton. </para>

                                <para>- We can deal with the imported article at the present time. Unfortunately; as. I have already .  pointed out, when the Commerce Bill was before  us  the Committee saw fit to reject an amendment which I moved: providing that a true trade description should remain on all goods until they reached the consumer. What  is  the use  of  merely insisting upon a true trade description being placed on goods until they pass through the Customs when the labels may  be  torn  off&#39;  and the consumers subsequently victimized ? We shall have  to do  something in the direction I have indicated, and. subject  to  that condition . I shall  be  prepared  to  grant a little more protection than I should otherwise  do. </para>

                        <para>Mr.HUTCHISON. - Then he must have obtained it from the same source. A simple calculation will prove that a Tariff that meant a. burdenof12s, per week for every family of six would raise a revenue of&#163;21,000,000 per annum. -As I have said, the Budget shows that South Australia last year, under the old Tariff, raised <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> os.9d. per head of the  population,  and the Treasurer estimates that next year the &#39;Customs and Excise revenue collected there will represent <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> 3s. 23/4d. per head of the population, or an &#34;increase of only2s. 53/4d. per head&#39; for the whole year. If we are able to. establish new industries as the result of such a small increase- of taxation, we shall have done a great work </para>

                        <para>Mi. HUTCHISON.- I am not here to discuss the merits of the various Labour newspapers. During the debate great stress has been laid on the financial position of the&#39; Commonwealth, and the growing necessity for an increased revenue if we are to exercise all the powers with which we are vested under the Constitution. If we are to speedily exercise those powers and to take over unproductive services, such as quarantine and light-houses, if we are also to provide for the payment of old-age pensions we shall require a largely increased revenue. So far, very little emphasis has been laid upon the fact that in taking over these Departments from the States we shall relieve them of a great deal df financial responsibility. That is a factor, I submit, which ought .to be taken into consideration when we come to re- arrange our .financial system owing to the discontinuance of the -Braddon section of .the Constitution. I have heard a great many complaints by honorable members about the financial position with which we shall be faced in the near future. But, with the exception of the &#39;honorable member for Flinders, the only suggestions made as .to how. additiona&#39;l revenue might be secured, have emanated from members of the Labour Party. The honorable member for Flinders told us that, even if we do not incur &#39;a single new obligation, we shall be faced in three or four years with a deficiency of a million. He suggested a remedy - the good .old borrowing remedy, which has been the curse Of the States. </para>

There was a time in the history of the States when it was absolutely necessary .to borrow money for the purpose of building railways and developing our country. But that day has gone by - I hope for ever. Surely we have now reached the stage when we can live within our income. Need I point out that in this country absentees have millions of pounds worth of property which we have to protect&#39;? Every pound that is expended upon public works enhances the value of that property, and yet its owners contribute nothing to the revenue through the Customs. To my mind, it is high time that we dealt with this class.  I  do not want to see absentee property owners in Australia. If we desire population, let us get rid of our absentees- </para>

How could they be the same boys and youths - if they entered the Public Service at fifteen years .of age - after they had served six years ? Does he mean to tell me that the Public Service Commissioner, whom we appointed to prevent men from being pitchforked into the Service to do boys&#39; work and to draw salaries which they are unable to earn, is actually allowing that to be done? </para>

I like to speak of a subject of which&#34;  I  have most knowledge. Take my own trade as an example. &#39;I have had to take .apprentices, to pay them, and. to teach, them their trade. In the initial stages of their apprenticeship, they were worth almost nothing to me, but Before their term had expired they were able to do a man&#39;s work. In the same way I believe that those who were doing boys work in our Public Service when they entered it six years ago, are performing men&#39;s work to-day. I do not believe for a moment that we are paying . &#163;250,000 extra annually to men for doing boys&#39; work. The statement is absurd upon the face of it. I was a member of the Commission which was appointed in South Australia to investigate the working of the Civil Service of that State. We appointed a Board&#39; to classify the whole service, and its classification was accepted&#39; by the Public Service Commissioner of the Commonwealth as a guide to him. I had a conversation with the Commissioner some time ago in regard to the non-payment of increments to South Australian officers who had been transferred to the Commonwealth, and whose existing and accruing rights </para>

                        </continue>
                        <para>Were preserved to them under the Constitution. The Commissioner informed me that the reason why those increments had not been paid was that if they had been met, when the present occupants of various offices either died or resigned from the service, he would be called upon to pay their successors more than the work which they performed was worth. That/ is sufficient evidence that the Commissioner has taken good care that he is not paying too much for the services which are rendered. I can tell honorable members of a number of cases of absolute sweating throughout the service. All that the Commissioner has done has been to sweat some members of the service, and to give big salaries to others. I am simply astounded at his power. </para>

I can assure him that I was shocked when I learned what was going on in that State. Things were bad enough in South Australia, but I must say that they did not approach the conditions which obtained in New South Wales. </para>

                                <para>- If we have a corrupt Parliament and a corrupt Ministry I admit that anything is possible. But no accusation of that sort has ever been made against this Parliament. If at any time I find that the wrong man is being pitchforked into any office in the Commonwealth Service simply to suit a Minister, I shall not hesitate to raise my voice in protest. &#39; But my experience in South Australia was that, whilst I could often prevent injustice being done to an officer, if I had attempted to secure him undue promotion or an unfair increase of salary other members of Parliament would very soon have exposed what I had done. What is the position at the present time ? Does the honorable member for Dalley know what influence is being used to-day? Can he account for some of the appointments which are being made? I have had some cases put before me, the nature of which has astounded me. But I have simply had to say,&#34; I cannot help you. I wish that I could.!&#39; </para>

The honorable member, for. Dalley has asked me if I can cite any cases pf injustice. I propose to give one. As honorable members are aware, applicants for positions in the Telephone Department are required to pass an examination. Three y.ears ago nine candidates passed that examination, . and during the interval which has .&#39;since elapsed three of them have obtained casual employment. One of these candidates&#34; was an exceedingly smart girl, according to the testimony of the head of, the Department) and with the other two rib fault could be found. The .business of the.

                        <para>The recent examinations for. telephone attendants :and .telegraph messengers have (writes the South Australian correspondent of <inline font-style="italic">The Transmitter)</inline> caused a lot of dissatisfaction, due. &#34;principally to .the fact that candidates were expected to know more than&#34; -the notification of - the set subjects implied, especially as regards the arith metic It was stated that-the. questions would be .in the first four rules, and yet the candidates were required to have a knowledge of proportion, fractions, and algebra, to successfully answer the questions. The- irony of- the whole matter is that in our State two young ladies who were&#39; successful in a former examination, and have been engaged as temporary attendants for some considerable time .during the past three years, but were unable to secure permanent employment owing to the lack of vacancies, had to again submit themselves for examination,&#39; and were found &#39; among those who failed to pass---  the questions in arithmetic &#34;being so- much stiffer on this occasion, than formerly, and yet- these &#34;two unfortunates&#34; have proved themselves expert telephone attendants. We fail to see why a- - telephone attendant, who in the ordinary course of&#39; duty would not be called upon&#39; to perform anything more arduous than - from&#39;.an arithmetical point of view - add up a few . columns of figures, should be expected to pass an examination- practical! v &#34;as regards this subject upon all fours with ti University junior examination. </para>
                        <para class="block">Surely it. is enough to .submit to one examination girls who wish to become telephone operators. What is the -use of examining such girls in a- subject like algebra? On being appointed, the girls naturally forget all . that . they learned tq &#39; qualify to pass the entrance examination, and. three years later are not in a position to go up for examination again: In Scotland, on one occasion, when an applicant for the position of exciseman was asked the distance of the sun from the earth, he said that he did not know, but. that he thought it was far enough away not to interfere with the discharge of his duties. A very proper reply to an unnecessary question. I regard many of the questions which are now asked as unnecessary,, and I hope that some of the examinations will be abolished. The Public Service Commissioner should have power to arrange the examinations, to fix rules, and to say what names on a list .should be accepted; but the Deputy Postmaster-General or the Minister should have the right to say how: many employes should be appointed, .and have the power to dismiss them if unsatisfactor.v . At the present time no inquiry is made as , to the character pf the boys taken, on, or as. to their parentage, which is a very, important thing- in connexion, with the Public Service. Consequently there- are boys, pf very bad character in the Service. On. one occasion I brought before, the Minister, a case in which a man- had. been caught red-, handed in . theft. Something had gone, wrong at every place to which he was appointed, but, instead of being punished, he, was promoted, and. when I brought the case, forward, an attempt, was made to put the&#39; b&#39;lame&#39; on . a dead brother, who had borne, an excellent character., Coming to another matter, I think that a great- blunder has been committed. _in. handing, back &#39;to the States  dyer.  ^5)000,006  of surplus revenue .with-, out crediting it against the transferred properties. We are now coming to the end of our financial tether, and,- later on, probably it will be proposed that we- should- borrow &#39; money -to. buy. back for the people buildings which now belong to&#39; them.,&#39; surely the&#39; very height of absurdity. Every, penny returned to the States over and &#34;above their three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue, should have been credited to transferred properties. &#34; I wish now to deal with a Department . which honorable, members do not seem too ready -to criticise, one that &#39;isunproductive, but most&#39; expensive, the Department df Defence. On page  73  of the Estimates,  ^941,916  is provided for defence expenditure, of which-  ^594,629-&#39;  will gp to the Military branch.&#34; This, according to the Minister, is -what&#39; we&#34; are paying to- train less than 1 per cent, of Australia&#39;s manhood, and to provide an indifferently equipped force of .something like 23,000 men. Is it not a state of affairs which should be tackled by Parliament ? The sooner the better. Honorable, members who take the trouble to read Colonel Reay&#39;s admirable pamphlet will get some valuable information about the Swiss system. The Swiss army costs &#163;1,500,000 per annum, and Switzerland could, within a few hours, put into the field a well-equipped fighting force of .232,000 men, while-, she has also an armed reserve of 44,000, and a second unarmed reserve of 262,000, although her population is smaller than that of the Commonwealth. We have a richer country than Switzerland to defend, and the fact that we are the only people who own an entire continent should make us alive to the need for providing effectively for defence, seeing that we have a coast line of  8,000  miles to guard. Defence should be a burden of which every citizen should be prepared to carry his share. The frank statement of the Minister that, although we have been federated for nearly seven years, we have not yet a scheme of military organization capable of development, was most remarkable and disquieting. Until something is done to obtain such a scheme, so that we may get value for our money, it might be wise to consider the advisability of curtailing our defence expenditure. The Minister has told us that to train 100,000 men in accordance with our present methods would cost no less than ..&#163;2,000,000, an expenditure which is out of the question so far as Australia is concerned. Before the Budget debate is concluded honorable members should pay the closest attention to this subject, and should do all in their power to assist the Minister to overcome the difficulties which confront us. I do not blame him .for not having done all that he wishes. In my opinion, no Minister has yet been able to properly control the Military Department&#39;. There is a power in that Department which should be broken up or curbed.- &#39; It is monstrous that we get so little for our expenditure on defence. The Swiss system has been held up as a model for us to follow, and we might very well adopt some of its features ; but it must be remembered that Switzerland is hedged round by armed powers, and that her people are military enthusiasts. The nation sprang into being by force of arms something like 600 years ago, and its surroundings have made it necessary to be prepared for hostilities at any moment. Happily, our situation is different. It would be difficult to arouse in Australia military enthusiasm such as- exists in Switzerland, and I do not know that it is necessary. But we must provide efficiently for our defence. A splendid thing about the Swiss system is that no man can be an officer in the army who has not passed through the ranks. When I first came into this Parliament the then Minister of Defence - he is now Minister of Trade and Customs - promised, in answer to a complaint which I had made, that it should be possible for rankers to receive commissions. But  1  find that, not long since, the son of a State Commandant, who, so far as I know, has not done an hour&#39;s drill, has been given a commission, while young enthusiasts who had given years of study to military work have been passed over. I myself have always been a military enthusiast. In the old country thirty years ago I belonged to the volunteer force, and twenty-three years ago was a non-commissioned officer in the old South- Australian volunteer force. Later on I helped to raise, and became a member of, a Scotch corps in Adelaide. When&#39; one of its officers had to retire because he had reached the age limit, and another left, I was urged by the Commanding Officer and the men to apply for a commission, but I declined to do so, because the uniform of a Scottish officer costs more than I could well afford. But, on being urged, I agreed to make the necessary application. I may say that, when the corps was raised, I, as a. member of the Parliament of South Australia, was in a sufficiently good position to satisfy the military caste as to my qualifications for a commission. Together with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Josiah</inline> Symon, who was not a member of Parliament at the time, I was asked to attend and address a meeting convened to advocate the* establishment of the corps. I attended the meeting, and joined the corps myself. When the number of members of the State Parliament was reduced I was out of politics for eighteen months, and employed myself during that time in conducting a: Labour newspaper. Will it be believed that when I was thus engaged, an officer came to trie and said, &#34; Hutchison, if you want to get your commission you had better use your influence-&#34; ? I replied that I had never used influence in my life, and would not allow Kim to say a word on my behalf, because I wanted to see what the Defence Department would do. I acted as officer for ten months, and when I applied for a commission I did not receive a reply. When, however, I was returned to the Federal Parliament I found the Staff tumbling over each other with apologies and explanations why I did not get my commission. Are we to allow that sort of thing to go on? </para>

                                <para>- I should have been a lieutenant. I found, however, that  1  would have to take command of a company, and, as I felt that my parliamentary duties here would not permit of my doing justice to myself or the force, f preferred to sever my connexion with the latter. There were several similar cases ; and Major-General Hutton was in command at the time. One of the finest young fellows  1  have known, of the highest character and great ability, who had gone through all the ranks up to that of a colour-sergeant, and was a valued public servant, was urged by his commanding officer to apply for a commission. However, he was disinclined to do so, because, as he said, he knew that it meant expenditure which he could not afford. It was pointed out to him that his refusal would mean a great loss to the Company ; but, simply because he was an employ! in a modest position, he did not satisfy the demands of the military caste, and therefore did not get his commission.  This young, man did not come to me in connexion with the matter, but a friend of his did, and I was asked whether, as a member of Parliament, I would permit this sort of treatment to be meted out to members of the Defence Force. I pointed out that if I interfered it might mean that the young man would suffer for it afterwards.  1  discovered that there were three young men in a similar position ; . and when I put a question on the notice-paper asking for information, an attempt was made by the Head-quarters Staff to find out to which individual I was referring. A remarkable thing happened. The application was sent in during January or February, I believe, but it. was not sent on to the staff office until three days afterwards, which brought it into the next month, thus enabling- the&#39; applicant to be discovered, and possibly marked. That is the sort of administration which must be put an end to ; and only a strong Minister &#39;of Defence can supply the remedy. Whether a man be a &#34;cook&#39;s son &#34; or a &#34; duke&#39;s son,&#34; to use the words of Kipling, if he be fitted for the position and his character is&#39; good, he ought to receive the appointment. Indeed, as I say, we ought to go further, and, copying the Swiss system, refuse to give a man a commission until he has passed through the ranks. Another point on which we might copy the Swiss system is this - that if an officer contracts debts which he cannot pay, he ought at once to be relieved of his command. I have had some experience in connexion with officers and bad debts, and I am glad to say that the Minister of Defence did all in his power in particular cases to see that justice was done. These facts all go to show how rotten is this institution, which is costing us about &#163;1,000,000 per annum. I quite appreciate the difficulties of a layman in administering a Department like that of Defence;. but if those officers who are there for the purpose of assisting the Minister are not able to devise a proper scheme, it is time that the amounts voted for their salaries were struck off the Estimates, and the services obtained of others who are qualified for their positions. For twenty-three years I have been of the opinion that we. should have a compulsory military force. What we first have to do is to determine how much&#34; money we are prepared to spend on the Defence Department. Having decided how- to apportion the money between the army, the navy, and so forth, we are faced with the important question of how to obtain the largest number of trained men, and the most efficient equipment, for the sum at our disposal. I- do not think that we ought to spend more than &#163;1,000,000 per annum for a considerable time to come. It is the duty of every citizen to share in the defence of the country, and, that being so, service ought to be compulsory; but here I depart from the Swiss model. Although the Swiss system is all that is to be desired, I do not think it is suited to our conditions, and, therefore, ,we &#39;ought to devise some more convenient system. I now give merely an outline of suggestions, because I do not pretend , to be a military expert ; the Minister has in the service officers who will be able to say whether what I propose is or is not practicable. If the service be compulsory there will be no necessity to spend a single pound on uniforms. At the present time recruits in some instances are made trained soldiers before they are served with uniforms, but under our system it is thought necessary to have uniforms, the supposition being that it is the uniforms which attract the young men. If, however, the service were compulsory, with no need to hold out attractions, the men could go through the period of training in their ordinary clothes. </para>

But we know that if we are against war we ought to be ready for war, and no country in the world is so unprepared as Australia is at the present time. It is all humbug to talk of hordes of Asiatics invading the Northern Territory. If hordes of Asiatics could be sent over here in a short time there would be danger, but,&#34; as&#39; a matter of fact, they cannot. We know the trouble that Great Britain, with all her resources, had in sending men fast enough to cope with the Boers in South Africa. </para>

It would be impossible to shift large bodies of men from any Asiatic Country faster than we could deal with them here, with help from the British Navy. The scheme that I would advocate would be on the following lines: I would try to bring into line the greatest number of trained soldiers with the best equipment. The best beginning would be to train all the school boys for the service. I would depart from the Swiss model, because we are so short-handed and our country is expanding at such a rate that it would be impossible to withdraw our youths from their workshops and other employments for a month or six weeks at a time. </para>

                                <para>- I believe that it would be a splendid thing to do. It would make men of our boys. In Switzerland the process of training compels the men to go through hedges, leap stone walls, march and counter march for a whole day at a time, and generally submit to a course of severe physical exercise. That is the kind of thing to put stamina into our youths. Our boys, having been trained at school, would have a preliminary knowledge of discipline. They &#34;could be taught to shoot, and when they arrived at manhood, they would be drafted into the regular regiments. But our industries could not endure the disorganization incidental to drafting large numbers of men into training camps for long periods. I have been in training camps that lasted only four days, and where very useful work was done. When I became a . volunteer in the old country, I had to put in thirty recruit drills, and when they were completed I had to put in, at least, nine company drills, and three, battalion drills during the year. The system which was followed is one which could easily be adopted here: .The volunteers were drilled in a drill hall during the winter months. A company was drilling every night in the week. If I happened to be attending a class for study  op.  the Monday night and my company was drilling on that night I was allowed to fall in on the Tuesday. If I wanted to go somewhere else on the Tuesday I fell in on the Wednesday, and if for some other reaSO&#39;1 the Wednesday was not convenient I fell in on the Thursday. There was no difficulty in completing the number of drills required during the year. </para>

                                <para>-  I understand that the honorable member would not be in favour of compulsory training in this country. <inline font-weight="bold">&#34;Mr. HUTCHISON.</inline> - Undoubtedly I should be if it were practicable. I believe that it is every man&#39;s duty to take, part in the defence of his country, and to be a guardian of its&#39; liberties. The honorable member, is, I understand, afraid of militarism, but what has he to fear when all the citizens of the Commonwealth are trained and drilled? If there were an attempt at tyranny, like the recent attempt of Premier Carruthers, the people would be able to defend themselves and their country&#39;s &#39; interests. No doubt the Minister of Defence would be told by his experts that  what I recommend would not be sufficient. But what I am anxious to secare is some training for our youths without harassing employers or upsetting industry. If the experts say that it is not possible to secure a properly trained&#39; force under such a system, I point out that when some of the South Australian artillerymen were sent to the Boer War, Imperial officers who saw them at work said that they were little inferior to the artillery of the Imperial Army, and did splendid service. I remember that when one of our batteries was depleted through sending men to the war, <inline font-weight="bold">Colonel Ramsay</inline> Smith, of the Medical Staff, took it in hand, not as a medical man, but as an artillery captain, and in a few months he had that battery up to its old strength and efficiency. I quite agree, however, that it is impossible to work a volunteer and militia force together. It has been tried in Australia, and has always failed. </para>

                                <para>- The two systems have never worked side by side, and never can. Nor do I think that much success will attend efforts to drill a part of the rifle clubs. The whole must be drilled or none. Men will not care to join rifle clubs if some enthusiasts want to have drill, and try to persuade the others to consent against their will. If anything is done in this direction the drill must be compulsory, though it should be made as little harassing as possible. But, of course, the rifle clubs affect only a. very small part of our defences. I am astonished at the statement of the Minister, that we have been able to . keep up our Volunteer Forces only by omitting the medical examination.&#39; I think that that is a very great pity. Although I do not look a very strong man, I have had to be on duty continuously for sixty hours. I did not object ; but men who looked much stronger than I did were unable to undergo the strain. If we have no medical examination of the young men entering &#39;our forces an injustice may often be done. No man should be called upon to engage in drill unless he is certified to be medically fit. A man might be injured by the strenuous work that he is sometimes called upon to perform as a member of the Defence Forces. I am satisfied that Australians trained in the way I have mentioned would be capable of doing even better than the Boers did in South Africa. There is still another very important branch of defence to which we must devote attention. Unlike Switzerland, we have 8,000 miles of coast-line to protect, and I recognise that there is no hope of our being able to build a navy of our own in the true sense of the word, since a battleship of the <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> type costs &#163;1,500,000. It must be admitted that such an expenditure will be for some time beyond our reach ; yet we&#39; must be prepared to police our waters against the probable raiders of our commerce at a time of national emergency, when the Imperial warships might be withdrawn. I find that one oceangoing destroyer of the first class, six coastal destroyers, and two first-class torpedo boats, would cost &#163;930,000, and it is proposed that that expenditure shall be spread over a period of two years. I agree with those who say that we could not at the present time bear that expenditure, added to a military vote&#34; of over &#163;800,000. I regard the Naval Agreement Act as a wretched, trumpery arrangement, and the sooner we repeal it the better. The subsidy is of. no importance to the Imperial Treasury, but it would go a long .way towards providing for torpedo boats and cruisers for the defence of our coast. I am satisfied that it would be well if all parts of the Empire having coast-lines to defend built their own navies, and that the several squadrons so constituted would be of as much assistance to Great Britain in time of war as were the squadrons of the allies to the Athenian Navy at Salamis. Even if our vessels were not first-class battleships, they would be a splendid auxiliary force in time of trouble. If we proceeded to lay down the foundations of a navy of our own we should have, in Australia more docks, more ship-building yards, and more factories for the production of warlike stores, and; we should be able to do far more than we are now doing with the &#163;200,000 paid annually under the Naval Agreement. I have occupied the attention of the Committee at some length, but I felt it my duty to deal with the two questions of the new protection and the defence of Australia. If we have officers who, although connected with our military organization for some years, are yet unable to devise a workable scheme, there must be something wrong. On the other hand, if they have a scheme for the defence of Australia, by all means let it be submitted by the Minister to the House. I speak in the interests of the taxpayer. Although I belong to a party, many of the supporters of which do not desire any military expenditure,. I recognise that whether they desire it or not, our circumstances are such that we may be called upon at any time to defend ourselves, and that we should therefore prepare for such an emergency. </para>
