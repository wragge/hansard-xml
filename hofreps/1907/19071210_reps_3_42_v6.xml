                        <para>- I will take into consideration the suggestion made by the honorable member. On general principles,.  1  agree with him as to the necessity for ascertaining the physical fitness of cadets for the work they are asked to perform. Instructions have been given to all the responsible officers in the various States to see that no boy physically unfit for such work is permitted to join the cadets. Further attention will be given to the matter. </para>

                        <para>The announcement made last month, with a great flourish of trumpets, by the Victorian District Commandant that the parades for the King&#39;s Birthday were to &#34;be of a service and not a show nature seems to have exhausted the efforts of thehead-quarters&#39; staff in this direction. </para>
                        <para class="block">Although it was pointed out then that the useful parades were the work of the regimental commanders, it would seem that their attempts to continue this really valuable work are to be rendered nugatory. One of the metropolitan-, militia infantry regiments, after great trouble and preparation, recently wrote to the District Commandant for leave to hold a moving camp and two nights&#39; bivouac from Heidelberg to Diamond Creek on the coming Foundation Day in January. Nearly  400  of the men had agreed&#39; to give the necessary time to the work. They have now been informed that ColonelStanley will not consent to this programme, and refuses to recommend&#39; the expense, which is less than  &#163;50.  As there are several salary increases to the heail-quarters&#39; stuff list this year largely exceeding this sum, and as a moving camp is one of the very necessary war condition practices of which the local troops have too&#39; little opportunity, it is to be hoped that personal consideration will be given by the Minister to the matter. So keenly do the officers and men on the infantry feel over the incident that if  Colonel&#39; Stanley  remains obdurate they will themselves endeavour to subscribe the amount necessary to carry out a military service too frequently neglected. </para>

                    <para class="block">Wickham took a lease from the New Guinea Administration, under which he had a right to purchase the fee-simple of certain islands. He exercised his , option under the contract before the Papua Act of 1905 came into operation, but the deed was not issued. The land law was changed, and no deed in fee simple can be issued. It is open to question whether he has not a claim for compensation against the Government, if they fail to fulfil the contract made with him. The object of the Bill is to enable the Commonwealth Government to fulfil the obligations of the contract. </para>

I think that on a previous occasion the honorable gentleman stated that he regarded the survey of the coast of Australia as a work for which the Commonwealth Government is responsible, or, at any rate, should give particular attention to. As a good deal of correspondence has taken place between the State Government of Western Australia, the Admiralty, and the Commonwealth Government; I should be much obliged if the Prime Minister can give the House any information with regard to the position of this very important matter at the present time. </para>

                        <para>- I desire to ask you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> whether there is any chance of improving the electric lighting of the chamber ? The present light has had a very bad effect upon my eyes, and several other honorable members have complained that it has affected their sight. Some, I believe, have had to take to wearing glasses. The defective light also has, in some instances, had the effect of causing violent pains across the temples- Is there any. probability of an improvement being made before the sittings are resumed next year ? </para>

                        <para>- No complaint had been made to me about this matter until the honorable member for Lang drew attention to it, or I should have taken some steps earlier to improve the lighting. The fact is that the colouring which is used to tint the globes of the electric light gradually deteriorates in use. This makes it neces- . sary that the globes should be taken down each session, and freshly tinted globes substituted. I shall have that done before we meet again next year. </para>

The erection of several additional lines is now being arranged for, and in order  to obtain the best possible results from present circuits, line inspectors have for some time past been making a pole-to-pole examination of the principal northern, southern, and western circuits in order to ascertain what is necessary, if possible further to strengthen the lines and prevent interruptions, and the carrying out of portions of this work is now being arranged for. </para>

                        <para>- My authority is the honorable member for Wimmera, who is a newspaper man, and also obtained information from the Country Press Association. He assures me that the proprietors of the smaller newspapers do not like to get their inks in quantities of 1 cwt., because they use it slowly, and, as it deteriorates, it does not pay them to do so. My information comes not only from the honorable member for Wimmera, but from individual newspaper proprietors who are entirely disinterested parties, and are technical experts on the question of printing. The honorable member for Wimmera, as he could not be present, has asked me to take up the, case on behalf of the Country. Press Association. As I said last night, the ink for the great newspaper proprietors is admitted at 30 per cent, and 25 per cent., but the small proprietors, who, owing to technical difficulties, have to use more expensive ink, costing from 4d. to 6d. per lb., are subject to duties ranging, from too to 130, and even 200 per cent. One invoice which. I have  here shows that the landed cost of a small consignment of ink was&#163;1818s.  6d.,  and that the duty amounted to  &#163;18 4s.,  or practically  100  per cent. I appealed to the Treasurer to place all printers&#39; inks on. a common basis by making them subject to the duties proposed in item  355,  namely,  30  per cent, and  25  per cent., but he declined to accept the suggestion. Various members on the Government side shook their heads, reminding me very forcibly of those images which nod when they are touched; but not one was &#34;game&#34; to attempt to refute my statements. <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> have taken some interest in this matter, and I know, as well as such a thing can be known, that a majority of honorable members saw the justice of the proposition which I advanced, and were prepared to support my proposal. Unfortunately, the settlement of the question was delayed so late that many honorable members had been obliged to pair and go away ; and when I saw that the Government were determined to force their proposal through on a minority vote, I got disgusted and marched out of the chamber, followed by other honorable members. </para>

I asked that all inks should be placed on one basis, and was not particular whether the duties chosen were <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> or fixed. I  hope that to-day, the Committee will see that justice is done. Last night I moved that the fixed rate should be omitted, but failed, and I also failed in having the duty reduced to  3d.  I then moved the duty should be  4d. </para>

                    <para>.- For the best part of an hour yesterday afternoon I listened to the Treasurer explaining a difficulty which had arisen in regard to amendments. One portion of the speech was a sermon and another portion an appeal, and the whole was directed to showing that no power would force him to accept differential treatment of newspaper proprietors in relation to the duty on news paper. The honorable gentleman declared that all newspapers must be treated alike - that there must be no discrimination as between the large newspaper proprietors and small newspaper proprietors. In the item now under discussion, however, there is a discrimination, not in favour of the small proprietor, but in favour of the large proprietor; and we have no sermon or appeal from the honorable gentleman about being forced into a false position. On the contrary, the Treasurer is seeking, by sheer force of numbers, to bring about that discrimination which he so violently denounced yesterday. There is now an opportunity presented to the Government to carry out a declared policy of treating all sections of the community alike. </para>

                        <para>- I am opposed to favouring any man. Yesterday the Treasurer declaimed in the most magnificent fashion against the proposal of the honorable member for Coolgardie. The honorable member for Barrier assured the Treasurer of his support with a true protectionist&#39;s vote in order that all the newspaper proprietors might be treated alike; but that offer was not deemed satisfactory. It must be admitted that when the Treasurer voted in favour of a duty on news paper, he appeared to be about the most dissatisfied man in the chamber. If the Committee determine to adopt a fixed in preference to an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty, I trust that it will be made to apply both to this item and to the next. I am satisfied that a satisfactory ink is being produced in Australia, and I am prepared to extend to it a reasonable measure of protection. . But not a tittle of evidence has&#39; been forthcoming to warrant us in discriminating in favour of the large newspaper proprietors. </para>

                        <para>- I am innocent of the reason which prompted the honorable member for Illawarra to interrupt me. I do not quite appreciate the connexion between printing and stencilling inks and the presence of the honorable member for Melbourne in the chamber. Personally, I do not intend in connexion with Tariff legislation to discriminate in favour of any section of the community. It appears to me that the Government proposal is a mos&#39;t flagrant attempt to confer an advantage upon&#39; the printer who imports ink in large quantities, as against the individual who imports it in small quantities because his needs are small. In view of the magnificent and sustained appeal which the Treasurer made yesterday, when he declared that he was absolutely opposed to anything that might even be considered a discrimination, he should, in common fair- 0 ness, adopt the principle which he then advocated in respect of this item. </para>

                    <para>-- I intend to vote in favour of extending equal treatment to every employer engaged in the printing business. A little episode occurred last night,&#39; and I wish to say, as a matter of personal explanation, that I  was extremely anxious that nothing should be done which would confer an advantage upon the metropolitan newspaper proprietors, as compared with their country brethren. I believe that in a full Committee the vote would go in favour of the country press. Had a division been taken last evening, however, I am satisfied that it would have gone against the country press.. It was for that reason that I voluntarily left the chamber. I might have been seen walking out of the vestibule arm-in-arm with the honorable member for Capricornia. I absolutely deny the suggestion that I was forcibly detained outside the chamber. In regard to the item immediately under consideration, it is incumbent upon me to do all that I possibly can to prevent Tariff discrimination in favour of the city press. I shall therefore vote for the lowest possible rate of duty. </para>

                    <para>.- When this item was being discussed this morning, many honorable members were labouring under a misapprehension. Indeed, I believe that a majority still imagine that it relates to news printing ink. As a matter of fact, it does not. It relates to printing and stencilling inks, n.e.i., news printing ink being specifically mentioned in the next item. The honorable member for Capricornia has stated that &#34; printing and stencilling inks can be purchased for 3d. per lb. </para>

                        <para>- I am quoting the prices or ordinary printing and stencilling inks, which come under this item, whereas news . printing ink comes under the next item. If we take the. other colours of printing ink, which are admitted by every one to be more expensive, we find that the price of red runs from 12s. to 36s. per dozen lbs., blue from 3s. to 7s. 6d. per lb., magenta, maroon, and others from 3s. 6d. to 10s. per lb., and cobalt 30s. per lb. The prices of the inks vary, and that is the reason why a differential duty has been proposed. I believe that had this information been known to honorable members generally last night there would not have been a misunderstanding, and we should not now be dealing with the duty on the ink which is used by the newspapers in the electorate of the honorable member for Capricornia. I am just as anxious as any one to safeguard the interests of small country newspapers. I suppose that more country newspapers are printed in my electorate than in an\ other, because all the supplements for the country press of Victoria are printed there. </para>

                    <para>.- In view of the growth of illustrations the ink industry will expand rapidly. It ought to find occupation for a large number of persons. I was not in the Chamber when the honorable member for Capricornia was speaking, but I understand that he is under the impression that this item deals with the ink used by newspapers. </para>

                        <para>- A newspaper publishing illustrations, such as those I hold in my hand, would use the. ink which is covered by this item, but not an ordinary newspaper. I hope that the Government will adhere to the duty on these inks, which are fairly expensive and can be made here. Their manufacture already gives employment to a large number of persons, and promises to provide additional employment. There is not the slightest reason why the duty should be lowered if the Government mean to give any encouragement to the industry. </para>

                    <para>.- Unfortunately, I was not present this morning when that regrettable incident took place which prevented this item from being dealt with. As I had been travelling all day, I paired with the honorable member for Moreton, and went home. I understood at the time that he was in favour of allowing ink to come in at a lower rate, but whether he meant the ink covered by this item, or the ink covered by the next item, I cannot say definitely. It is certain, however, that the proprietor of a small newspaper has had to pay a duty equal to  100  per cent, on the ink which he has imported under item  355,  and which has cost him more than  3d.  per lb. There is no getting away from that fact. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member ought to have sense enough to know that in the case of newspapers a duty cannot be passed on, except, perhaps, to the advertiser. . The reader certainly cannot be charged1&#188;d. for a penny newspaper. I know that the honorable member is an authority on some questions connected with newspapers. For instance, he has published a series of his verses in the newspapers. </para>

                        <para>- But I trust that the honorable member will have gone to his last resting-place before I do. Otherwise my verses would soon drive him there. I think that the Treasurer ought to allow the item to be recommitted in order that the Committee may be able to express an opinion as to whether the duties of 6&#189;d. and 6d. per lb. should not be left out&#39; with a view to fixing an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty. The Minister might very well agree to <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties of 30 and 25 per cent. Does he want to impose a duty amounting to 100 per cent, upon ink that is used by newspaper proprietors in small country towns? A letter in my possession proves that a man in a country town has actually paid duty amounting to 100 per cent. I presume that he did not import ink to drink it. He bought it to use in his office. This and the next item place those who use ink at under 3d. per lb. at a decided advantage as compared with those who use ink at over 3d. If the Treasurer will allow the item to be recommitted, whatever <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty is imposed by the Committee we will willingly accept. </para>

                    <para>.- There has been a good deal of talk amongst honorable members about placing small and large newspapers on the same footing. It appears to me that remarks of that character in relation to the present item indicate a false assumption. </para>

                <para>Whether  the duty should be 6d. per lb. or 30 and . 25 per cent, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> is a question quite apart from the assumption that the duty as proposed differentiates between small and large newspapers. It does nothing of  the  sort. News printing ink, whether used on a rotary machine by the proprietor of a large newspaper, or on a Wharfdale machine by the proprietor of a small newspaper, is just the same class of news ink. </para>

                        <para>- When I speak of letterpress, I mean the term to include stereotype matter. Of course, in jobbing work, and in printing illustrations, a better class of ink must be used, as well as a better class of paper, whilst there must be more careful machining. It is impossible to work at the same speed when doing such work as the illustrated portion of the <inline font-style="italic">Australasian</inline> or the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Mail,</inline> or in printing a newspaper like the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin,</inline> as in printing an ordinary newspaper. Good ink must be used, and there must be careful machining. But a country newspaper and a city newspaper can use the same class of ink for letterpress work. The universal practice of the proprietors of country newspapers, so far as my knowledge of their methods  goes, is to order their ink from one or other of the printers&#39; furnishing houses like Cowan and Company, or Wimble, who import in large quantities. The newspaper proprietors do not import directly, but buy their ink as they want it. It is not worth their while to import. In fact, it is only the largest newspaper proprietors who bother to import directly. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member has put the case in the wrong way. The lower duty is on the cheap ink, that is merely used for newspaper purposes ; but the superior class of ink is used for jobbing and for printing illustrations and special work. Inks must be over a certain value before the extra duty is imposed. </para>

News printing ink. in order to be dutiable at the lower rate, must be invoiced at less than  3d.  per lb. in the country of origin, and since it is sold in Melbourne and Sydney at  3&#189;d.  per lb. after payment of  freight and other charges, it should not be difficult to import it at less than 3d. per lb. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that those duties are sufficient in the case of the better classes of ink. The possibility of&#34; arranging invoices is such that printing- inks have been known to come in at rates; far below their true value. The statement that this proposal will be an unfair handicap on country newspapers is utterly without foundation. I do not care very much whether a fair <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> or a fixed duty is carried, but I do not think that a. duty of 25 per cent, will be sufficient. </para>

There would &#39;certainly have been a great hubbub raised outside, for there is a very distinct difference between inks: used even for the rougher classes of job printing and ordinary news printing ink.

There are some inks which even an amateur would recognise as being of high quality, and to those the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty, as being the higher of the two duties, would apply. </para>

                        <para>- I am supporting the line as it stands. These  inks will  be subject to an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty as well as a fixed duty, and whichever is the higher duty will have to be paid. Printing ink of first class quality is being made in the Commonwealth, and we should give the manufacturers the &#39; protection that other industries have secured. The honorable member for South Sydney has clearly shown that news printing ink is altogether different from that used for job printing purposes ; and I fail to see how &#39;the Tariff could have been better framed to give full consideration to all parties concerned. There is nothing to complain about. It may be that some one has been called upon to pay duty under the wrong item - that some one has paid the higher duty on news ink - but such a mistake is not likely to be made very often. </para>

Most practical printers will say that these two inks are used for different kinds of work. Printing ink made locally does good work. I know an establishment where tons of Australian ink are used, and it gives every satisfaction. </para>

                    <para>.- As we had a long discussion on the subject of inks at the last sitting, and honorable members seem to have pretty well made up their minds, I hope that the debate will not be prolonged. The Minister has agreed to omit the limitation regarding packages ot not less than 1 cwt., and he is also inclined to accept a compromise which I suggested, making the duties sd. and 4jd. per lb. I shall vote for those rates. </para>

It assumes that items 354 and 355 deal only with such printing inks as are used for country newspapers. Does the honorable member propose the omission of the words &#34; and in packages of not less than 1 cwt.&#34; ? </para>

                    <para>Please bear in mind that all inks used by the larger newspapers come out in big casks, varying from 3 cwt. to 4 cwt., and it is really a different kind of ink to that used by the smaller newspapers ; it is what is called Rotary Ink, and is used for printing newspapers on the big rotary machines - altogether different to that used by the smaller newspapers on their flat-bed machines. The majority of the newspapers in Australia use the stiffer ink, and it is invariably sold to them in tins varying from 12 lbs. up to&#189; cwt. tins or packages. The smaller newspapers could not take large packages because it would take them so long a time to use it up, and dust and dirt gets into the ink and spoils it - hence their reason for getting the small packages. </para>
                    <para>The average price the smaller newspapers pay for their ink is over 3d. Under the proposed item they would have to pay - according to my reading of this item - a duty of 6d. per lb. for British-made ink. Assuming, therefore, they are paying 4d. per lb. now for their ink, it would cost them to use this British-made ink 9d. to10d. per lb. </para>

                    <para>.- We have had a great deal of what is assumed to be expert evidence from certain members of the Committee who have been connected with the printing trade. I do not know in what capacity they were connected with it, but admittedly some of them have not been connected with the trade for many years, and it is quite possible that important changes mav have taken place in the meantime. However that may be, I have facts to bring before the Committee which absolutely refute many of the statements that have been made. The proprietors of a certain newspaper - and though I have authority to do so I need not mention the name unless honorable members desire it - have in bond  2,000  lbs. of ink invoiced at  3d.  per lb., of which they have not yet been able to get possession because of this duty of  6&#189;d.  per lb., which is equivalent to an impost of  213  per cent. I ask the Minister to say whether that statement is not a fact. </para>

                        <para>- This ink is invoiced at  3d.  per lb., and those who have imported it cannot get it out of bond unless they pay a duty of  6&#189;d.  per lb. on it. That fact completely justifies the stand honorable members on this side have taken in this matter. I know the proprietors of other newspapers complain that they cannot get the ink they require without paying a duty equivalent to anything from  100  per cent. up to  250  per cent. That is a gross injustice, but I have little hope that the Minister will be prepared to recommit the item. </para>

                        <para>- It is only the proprietors of very big newspapers who can afford to import this ink in large quantities, because if it has to be kept for any length of time it deteriorates in value. I have mentioned a fact which cannot be disputed - that an ink imported for the purpose of printing a newspaper cannot be got out of bond except on the payment of duty representing 233 per cent. on the invoice price. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. I shall be very glad if in the future, as a result of the duty, they are obliged to look inside the Commonwealth for their ink as well as for their pennies. That would be only a fair thing, and, in fact, it is the whole purpose of the duty to bring that state of affairs about. Those who say that the more highly-priced inks are required for the printing of country newspapers know nothing about the business. </para>

                        <para>- I have used ink imported from the Old Country, and I have also used Wimble&#39;s inks. I have found Wimble&#39;s cheap inks good enough for the printing of newspapers, and equal to what I could get abroad for the same purpose. I was not, of course, in a big way of business, and if I required a small quantity of ink of a certain quality I had to pay a little more for it; but the ordinary news ink is imported in large quantities even by small printing concerns. It would be absurd to use a first-class ink for the printing of a newspaper. </para>

                        <para>- We could not expect good work with cheap ink on poor paper. -The quality of the paper must be taken into account; and good rolled paper would be required on which to produce illustrations effectively. I should be inclined to favour the amendment of the honorable member for Coolgardie; but I think the recommendation of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission, 6d. per lb., or 25 per cent., whichever is higher, is a reasonable one. There are extraordinary variations in the prices of inks. I have here a price-list from T. Bigsby and Son, of London, in which quotations are given for what purports to be first-class coloured inks. I find that ultramarine blue is quoted as 1s. for letterpress ink and is. 6d. for lithograph ink. I maintain that that is pure dumping. I have here also the price-list of Slater and Palmer, of London, which was referred to by the honorable member for Yarra. Their price for ultramarine blue is 5s. for letterpress ink, and 6s. for lithograph ink of the best quality. They quote prices for another quality of ink of the same shade - letterpress 3s. 6d., lithograph 4s. 6d. per lb. I can defy, not merely any Customs officer, but any printer or even any ink manufacturer, to tell me, on seeing printing done by a first-class printer on first-class paper with a first-class machine, whether the price of the ink used was is. 6d., 3s. 6d., or 4s. 6d. per lb. We can produce all the inks  Ave  require in Australia if we give our local manufacturers sufficient protection. I am sorry that the recommendation of the Tariff Commission was not adopted. I think in the circumstances it would be better to leave this item as it stands, and to fix the duties on the next item at 5d. and 4&#189;d. </para>

                    <para>. - We have had a very long debate on this matter last night and to-day. I think it is my duty to stand by the duties as proposed, and to carry them or duties as nearly their equivalent as possible. I admit that those who have been nearly all their lives intimately connected with the working of newspapers should know something about what is necessary. The duties set out in the Tariff have been proposed at the instance of those who are supposed to know what they are talking about. </para>

                        <para>- Indeed, no. I think all parties concerned were consulted by the Comptroller-General, and I believe there was no objection urged against the proposal made in the Tariff. I wish to point out that this proposal emanated in the first place from the A section of the Tariff Commission. </para>

                        <para>- That was not the reason which actuated honorable members; but I have no wish to refer to last night&#39;s proceedings when to do so might give rise to heated feeling. There must be a mistake somewhere, because the honorable member for Capricornia has stated several times that the <inline font-style="italic">Rochhampton Bulletin</inline> purchases this high-class ink for its ordinary printing, whereas I am advised that it is used for only very high-class work. The magnificent work in a little catalogue which I held in my hand just now - one of the best I ever saw was done with very high-class ink. Honorable members who have expert knowledge of this matter assure me that if I amend the next item by raising the invoice value mentioned in it from  3d.  to  6d.  per lb., it ought to obviate all the objection that has been taken to this item. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I hope the debate will not be greatly prolonged. I shall be quite prepared when we reach the next item to do what I have said. I ask honorable members to allow this item to pass, because we have a great deal of work to do. If honorable members will make reasonable progress I have no desire to keep the House sitting until the small hours of the morning. It is not a good thing to do, but I have been forced into that position in order to get a certain amount of work done. If the work is got through, I want the House to rise at a reasonably early hour to-night, meet to-morrow, and probably finish the whole Tariff, because we are near the end of it. With a solid determination on the part of honorable members to achieve that result, I think we can do it without sitting into the small hours. I have here a letter from Messrs. R. Collie and Company, who state - </para>

It also proves that country newspapers, if they so desire, can get their news ink made here instead of purchasing the imported. I only received that letter this morning, and I quote it because it shows that the ink is being made here, and is used exclusively by a number of country newspapers. </para>

                        <para>- My objection to the duty of 6&#189;d. proposed by the Minister on this item is that, as a large proportion of the inks come in at between 6d. and is. per lb., it will be over 100 per cent. on the 6d. inks, while it will be over 50 per cent, on the is. inks. Those are exceedingly high duties. </para>

                    <para>.- The local ink is, in most cases, from my own experience, better than the imported at the price. So far as higher-class inks are concerned, we can get the locally-made article at a lower price than the imported, and of equal value, while it has the distinct advantage that there is no deterioration. There is no surface caking, as the ink is got fresh from the mixer. We are justified, from every point of view, in imposing a duty on imported inks. There is very little risk of undue advantage being taken of the duties proposed, because there are several firms engaged in the manufacture of ink locally. I have it on the authority of at least one manufacturer in Sydney, that he is well satisfied with the present duties, without increasing prices, as he can now retain his present market. </para>

                    <para>.- Nothing could be more satisfactory than the statement by the honorable member for Macquarie, that the inks made here are of good quality, and a credit to Australia. The point is, however, that a. composite duty may penalize certain inks. An <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty would have been much more acceptable. As to the Customs officers discovering whether high-quality inks are introduced at the lower rate, there will be no more difficulty than there is in discovering whether cotton goods are being brought in as woollen goods. In either case, the services of an analyst has to be obtained. </para>

                    <para>.- I have listened to the arguments on both sides very carefully, and, I hope, with a fair and open mind; and I have not heard the scheme of duties submitted by the Commission successfully challenged up to the present, except in one detail. This was referred to by the honorable member for Coolgardie, who has proposed to increase the invoiced amount in item 355 from3d. to 6d. That amendment will, I think, enlarge the area of the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rate, and meet most of the difficulties suggested. I should like to point out to the honorable member for Wide Bay that the fixed duty, or art <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty, whichever is the higher, cannot be described as a composite duty in the accepted sense of the word. A composite duty is a combination of duties - that is a duty, plus a duty- whereas the duty under discussion is an alternative duty, which is justified in certain cases. The higher fixed duty of 6d. per lb. is intended to operate on low-grade inks which it might be difficult to analyze and classify, and which must cause the Customs officers difficulty in checking. A firm generally includes in its orders various grades of ink, low grade, medium, and high grade; and the evidence given before the Commission shows that the average price is about 2s. 6d. per lb. The fixed duty of 6d. is intended to operate on the average as represented by the 2s. 6d. per lb. ; and it is not fair to say that it will mean 100 per cent. The <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty is intended to operate when the inks are above the average I have just mentioned. The fixed duty of 6d. per lb. might be infinitesimal in the case of high-class inks, worth from 5s. to 6s. per lb. </para>

                        <para>- Not in reference to the item in which the fixed duty is imposed, and which is intended to cover the superior grades of ink. The lower classes of ink averaging from 3d. to 5d. per lb. are brought under the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rate in item 355. The portion of the report of the Commission having reference to this matter may be found on page 322 of volume 6, and is based on the  evidence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. R.</inline> Collie, the Melbourne manufacturer, whose proposals were supported by a Sydney manufacturer. The Tariff Commission considered that those proposals embodied a fair and reasonable scheme, which distributes over various grades of inks a certain incidence of taxation according to quality and value. If we had a common standard it would be complained that we were taxing the poor and cheap inks as highly as the superior inks. So far as I am concerned&#39;, I have not received any complaint from printers in my electorate about the duties, and I believe that the great fuss and noise is being made, not by printers, but by the Melbourne importers. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope the honorable member will not press the amendment. When I said that I would agree to a duty of5d. there was no idea of making the invoice price 6d. in the next item. I should like the duty to remain as it is in order to preserve the symmetry of the Tariff. I have agreed to everything that those who understand the business think is necessary, and the arrangement seems to be acceptable to the Committee. </para>

                    <para>. -  The vote which has just been taken means that a printing ink invoiced at 8d. per lb. will be required to pay a duty of 6d. per lb. Similarly, an ink which is invoiced at is. per lb. will be subjected to an impost of 6d. per lb. That means that there will be a duty of  50  per cent, on the ink. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Corangamite has referred to a certain vote given by me. What I voted for was to assist newspaper proprietors in the country districts. I was advised that if we made the invoice standard 3d. per lb., as the printers of small papers in the country do not import in bulk, they would have to pay a higher rate of duty. I understand that the amendment of the honorable member for Coolgardie raising the exemption from 3d. to 6d. allows printers of country newspapers to get their material in at the same rate of duty as is paid by the proprietors of the large newspapers in the big centres. That is what I voted for. I did not vote for anything like 100 per cent, but to reduce charges in favour of those who are not able to carry on their business on the large scale on which businesses are conducted by persons in the populous centres. </para>

The Treasurer, when I referred to the statement made by the Government whip, disclaimed any responsibility for it. This looks very like an attempt by a circuitous method to render Certain photographs liable to a heavy impost. </para>

As a matter of fact, I intend to include these&#39; photographs in item 407, and when we reach that item I shall propose to strike out the words &#34;n.e.i.&#34; appearing after the word &#39; &#39; photographs &#39; &#39;. and to substitute the words &#34; on Australian subjects.&#34; I shall also propose to strike out the words &#34; postcards (sensitized, with or without letterpress).&#34; The effect of those amendments will be to make free all photographs and post-cards that do not deal with Australian subjects. Our desire is to protect the local photographers - to cause photographic work relating to Australia to be carried out here. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that the Treasurer&#39;s proposal will not be agreed to. The reason given for the proposed alteration seems an absurd one. Does the Minister suggest that his dear old friend Lord Tweedmouth, desiring to send him a photograph, would come to Australia to have it taken in order to encourage an Australian industry? The wording of this item is very dangerous; many a man has got into trouble through having a photograph &#34; sent by a friend.&#34; </para>

                <para>I  also propose to move that the duties be reduced to  25  per cent, and  20  per cent. Stay paper and stay cloth are cut in Australia. It has been ascertained, however, that in order to defeat the object of this duty - the encouragement of the local industry - stay paper cut just a shade over an inch in width is being imported, and escapes the duty. To meet that attempt to evade the duty we propose to make dutiable all stay paper up to  2  inches in width. </para>

I do not know why misleading information should be supplied, but I am not prepared to have too much faith in the honesty of some honorable members who are whirling this Tariff through the House. We should have some explanation of the Minister&#39;s action in proposing a duty of  30  per cent., when this material was free under the old Tariff, and the recommendation of the Tariff Commission was that it should remain free. </para>

                        <para>- It is made chiefly by the Stein Machine Company ; those who make the machines manufacture the paper and cloth as well, which, I am told by persons in the trade, are not made in Australia. The samples which I produce are from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Firth&#39;s</inline> card-board factory in Sydney, and were imported. The Minister proposes to put a duty only on stay cloth cut to a width of. not more than  2  inches, which I take it would allow it to be imported in bulk free. </para>

                    <para>. - It is proposed to make stay cloth of not more than  2  inches in width dutiable because hitherto an attempt has been made to evade the duty by making it a little over an inch in width. However, as the item is not an important one, and I do not wish to waste time in connexion with its discussion, I shall be willing to agree to a duty of  5  per cent. in the general Tariff, making the article free if imported from Great Britain. </para>

                        <para>- The lettering can be done either before or after they are imported. Usually the only letterpress on the supplements are the word&#39;s at the head of the sheet, &#34; Supplement to&#34; such and such a journal, with the title of the picture underneath. Some very fine supplements are being produced in Australia to-day ; and I do not see why we should not encourage the artistic sense in the community. The <inline font-style="italic">Town and Country Journal</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Mail,</inline> for instance, usually issue a coloured Christmas supplement, and these are produced in Australia. If we decided that such coloured supplements should be admitted free, an inducement would be given to people to look outside the Commonwealth for them. </para>

I do not feel inclined to debate this item on the question of the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rate, but I wish to express the hope that throughout the rest of the Tariff, in all instances where the alternative method has been adopted, the Treasurer will drop the fixed and adhere to the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rate. </para>

                    <para>.- I hope the Treasurer will not allow the fixed duty to be struck out. The <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rate proposed will have no effect at all. Bicycles are being dumped here at &#163;5 apiece. The Tariff Commission went into the question, and their work should be recognised in connexion with this all-important industry. In Victoria alone there are over  1,000  men engaged in the bicycle trade. Why should we allow the foreigner to dump&#34; his bicycles here as he has been doing? In  1905  bicycles to the value of&#163;263,626 were imported. If the fixed duty is taken off, the cheap bicycles now in bond will be on the market to-morrow or the next day. Why should this protectionist House allow goods that in other countries are charged  40  and  50  per cent, to come in here at a duty of  25  per cent. ? No reason has been given for removing the fixed duty. There is every reason why it should be retained. It was recommended by the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission, which included the honorable member for Bendigo, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> and ex-Senator Higgs. </para>

                        <para>- It is not an enormous taxation. The&#39; cheaper bicycles should be kept out, as they are dangerous to ride. Why should we allow our markets to be flooded with cheap bicycles that people in other countries will not use? The local bicycle industry ought to be encouraged. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. There are a number of small men making bicycles all over Australia. They should receive some consideration. A duty of  25  per cent, on a &#163;5 bicycle will be only about  25s.  That will not prevent that class of machine being dumped here. This is another case where a protective Tariff has been the means of reducing , the price of an article. Previous to bicycles being made here, the cost of a machine was as high as from&#163;25 to &#163;30. The price has been considerably reduced, and now a proposition is put forward which will practically mean wiping out the industry. The men who are making bicycles here have been given to understand that they will get some protection. </para>

If the&#163;5 rate is retained it will be the means of reducing the price of the better class bicycle, and of preventing the foreign trader from dumping his cheap goods into Australia. We can make bicycles here. Honorable members opposite, times out of number, have asked how many men are employed in an industry, and whether we can make an article here. In this case we are making bicycles here complete, and equal to any made in any other part of the world. When that is so, let us impose a duty which Will prevent the foreign bicycle from coming in at all. </para>

                    <para>. - The answer to the honorable member for Batman, who; of course, knows all about the intricacies of bicycle manufacture as of every other industry by this  time, as the Committee has been made painfully aware during this long Tariff debate, is that bicycles are not made here. They are at the most assembled here. The parts are not made in Australia, and in all probability will not be for many years to come, no matter what duties are imposed upon them. Are we therefore to impose these inordinate rates for the mere sake of taxing out bicycles, and making them dearer to the public? That is the only question that we have to ask ourselves. This is no strangled industry. It has never begun to be an industry in Australia, so far as the <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> making of bicycles goes. All that happens is that the&#39; parts are imported and put together. I have no doubt the honorable member for Batman would call that a very elaborate process of manufacture. If he relies upon the Tariff Commission to buttress up his case, he will find small comfort there, and small encouragement for the vigorous propaganda which he seems to be waging on behalf of the local bicycle makers. Only two makers gave evidence before the Commission. I should like to hear from the  Chairman  of that body their reason for proposing an exorbitant duty of&#163;5, with an alternative of 25 per cent. It seems absurd on the face of it that  &#163;5  should be regarded as the equivalent of 25 per cent, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem.</inline> There is no relation between the two. Upon a highly finished machine,  &#163;5  might possibly be equivalent to 25 per cent., but on the cheaper bicycles it means 100 per cent, and over in many cases. </para>

                        <para>- I should think that a bicycle sold at 25s. would be a danger to life and limb. There is no doubt that the machines are made . very cheaply in places where their manufacture has been specialized, and where the output and the market are very large. We can never hope to equal the skill developed from the specialization of the industry in those parts of the world. We have therefore to depend upon the parts which are sent out from the Old Country. As all that is done here is to assemble the parts into the completed machine, it is the height of absurdity even to suggest these extraordinary high duties. The Minister will therefore, do well to strike out the fixed, and leave only the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem,</inline> rate. So far as I can ascertain none of the witnesses before the Commission advocated an increase in the duty on bicycles. One individual said that he would not object to an increase from 20 to 25 per cent, on the finished article. </para>

                        <para>- Since parts are not manufactured in Australia, that strikes me as a most reasonable request. I could  understand the honorable member for Bendigo recommending a duty of  &#163;5  per bicycle if the parts were being made here, but they are not, and may not be made here for a generation to come. I do not know what the honorable member could have been thinking of to submit this recommendation. I should like to hear him explain it. I point out to the honorable member for Batman that the process of putting the machines together is neither elaborate nor costly.  1  was speaking just now to a gentleman who is a practical mechanic, and here are the charges in the business for the putting together of these machines : To put together a complete machine costs only 12s. for labour. If, they put together three, the cost is brought down to 11s. per machine, and if they put six together they do it for 10s. each. That is the whole labour cost for assembling the parts of the machine. </para>

It  will be seen that the duties originally suggested were outrageous, and that those now indicated are still exceedingly high. I hope the Treasurer .will consent to put these duties much lower than 30 per cent, and 25 per cent, on the complete machine. </para>

All they ask is that parts shall&#34; be made uniformly dutiable at 10 per cent., without any increased protection on the finished article; but the Treasurer proposes to increase the duty on the latter to 35 per cent, and 30 per cent. Parts will not be made here for many years to come, and, therefore, the impost is simply an exorbitant revenue duty. </para>

                    <para>. - These duties have been the subject of much criticism in the press. We have learnt, many of us for the first time - from the honorable member for Bass, I believe - that eight bicycles, valued at <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> each, were landed at Launceston, and that, instead of a few shillings, the duty amounted to ^40. Then a gentleman from Queensland, when the Tariff was introduced, asked, that he might be allowed to unbraze imported frames, as the brazed frames were not worth. as much as the amount of the duty. The honorable member for Parramatta has read out figures relating to the labour cost, but, as I said in relation to the printing ink duty, very few honorable members can make themselves cognizant with the whole details of any industry. According to the honorable member for Parramatta, 12s. is .the labour cost of brazing the frame together. </para>

                        <para>- That is what is called the building of the frame. The honorable member for Parramatta admitted, however, that there was the enamelling, together with the building of the wheels an9 other charges. Some few years ago I endeavoured to ascertain by a question in the House addressed to the Minister of Trade and <inline font-style="italic">Customs the</inline> invoiced <inline font-style="italic">prices of</inline> various imported bicycles, and it was found that, just as in the case of gramaphones, typewriters, cash-registers, and so forth. on which there is either very little duty or no duty at all, the price at which they were invoiced was very small in comparison with the price at which they were sold to the public. It may safely be said that at least three-fourths of the bicycles used in Victoria have been built or put together within the State. </para>

                        <para>- But under the old Victorian Tariff there was protection. In New South Wales, on the other hand, where there was no protection, not one-fourth of the bicycles in use in that State are built there. If the bicycle industry had not been firmly established under the old Victorian Tariff, there would not have been half the people employed in it that there are to-day. It is not my intention to discuss the decision of the Victorian Wages Board in the cycle trade, though I disagree entirely with it in fixing the wages too low. That the Wages Board made a mistake is no reason why the duty_ on bicycles should be largely reduced ; and I am very sorry to learn from the Treasurer that he has decided to abandon the fixed rate. It would be a good idea on the part of the Customs authorities to periodically publish in the <inline font-style="italic">Government Gazette</inline> a list of the prices at which goods are invoiced when imported. If we could learn, for instance, that bicycles, which, when complete, are sold for  &#163;10, &#163;11, &#163;15,  and even as high as  &#163;30,  were invoiced at less than&#163;5, the public would realize the profits made by those engaged in importing. </para>

                        <para>- As to that, if the Treasurer has decided to reduce the duties on the finished article, he ought certainly to reduce the duties on the parts. take it that the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission, when they made their recommendations, had in view the duties on the parts as well as the duty on the finished machine. When the honorable member for Batman was speaking, the honorable member for Lang interjected, &#34; Are any of the parts made here&#34;? In reply, I may say that, with the exception of the tyres, I do not think that the parts are made here to any extent, although some may have been made by a few ingenious mechanics in their spare time. I guarantee that not 5 per cent, of the bicycle manufacturers in Great Britain make their own parts, but that they buy them from various firms, who have made a specialty of that branch of business, there being three or four standard parts turned out such as the B.S.A., the Edie, and one or two others. But those manufacturers of parts are now endeavouring to monopolize the whole of the cycle business at Home; and those of us who take an interest in trade saw recently what happened in America when, a firm there tried to do precisely the same.. I have here a copy of a letter originally sent to the Minister of Trade and Customs from the Melbourne representatives of the Canadian Cycle and Motor Company, which, I believe, is the Massey-H arris Company. The letter is as follows - </para>

                    <para>A petition requesting an additional increase in the General Tariff on bicycles and component parts thereof having within the past week been laid before you by a section of the bicycle trade we desire respectfully to protest in the strongest manner against their requests. As you are already aware, this company employs none but- British workmen in its manufactures, and having a large vested interest throughout the Commonwealth, is, we. claim, entitled to some consideration. When we thoroughly understood that the ultimatum of the Government was higher protection, we immediately set about a complete reorganization of our business. We are now receiving from Canada bicycle frame parts in the rough in exactly the same way as English importations. We have installed an up-to-date erecting and assembling, as well as an enamelling and nickel-plating plant, and now have working nearly twice the number of men formerly employed at bicycle building. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think the prices have been increased by a single shilling since the duty was imposed, though I cannot speak definitely, except in the case of Victoria. A fixed duty ought to be imposed in order to prevent the dumping of machines in Australia. I know that complete bicycles, which in the trade means bicycles minus tyres, saddles and chains, have been landed on the wharf at Melbourne, all charges, including duty paid, for less than &#163;3. </para>

Honorable members have said that the local builders of bicycles merely assemble the parts after the frame has been built. Of course, any person with ordinary common-sense could put the parts together if he only possessed a little mechanical knowledge. But I do not think that he could braze a machine and fit it up entirely unaided. </para>

                        <para>- Some honorable members who possess mechanical skill might possibly be able to do that sort of work. Of course, I realise that the Government having abandoned the fixed duties which appear in the schedule, it is hopeless for any honorable member to fight for them. I believe that by acting as they have done the Ministry have struck a heavy blow at many men who have equipped their shops with the appliances necessary for the building df machines from imported parts. Honorable members may have noticed that one of the standard makers of bicycle parts has recently increased the price of those parts. I have received, from a gentleman in the country, a letter which emanated from an exporter of bicycles in England. In it the writer points out that English manufacturers would be able to beat the Customs authorities even if the fixed duties which appear in the schedule were retained. He declared that British manufacturers did not contemplate losing the Australian trade. Personally, I want to see our own people retain as much of that trade as possible, and that result cannot be achieved if we agree to the proposal of the Treasurer. </para>

                    <para>. - I am very glad that the Treasurer has proposed the abolition of the fixed duties in respect of this item. I hold in my hand an invoice which gives the average value - exclusive of any charges - of thirty-six bicycles which are at present in bond. The value is set down at <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline> 9s. 6d.  each. The total consignment is valved at  ^197 3s. 6d.  So far from these machines having been dumped, I am informed that the price I have mentioned is a fair one for a good article, The charges upon the consignment added to the duty amount to  ^207  9s.  3d.  They work out as follows - f.o.b. charges <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> is.  3d.,  cost of packages <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline> 5s.,  freight and primage  ^8 16s. 1  id., duty at <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline> each ;&#163;i8o, landing charges at  6s.  per ton <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> 8s.  nd., insurance, exchange, interest, &#38;c, <inline font-style="italic">&#163;9</inline> 17s. 2d.,  or a total of  .&#163;207 9s. 3d.  on a declared value at the port of exportation of  ^197 3s. 6d.  These charges are equivalent to a tax of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline> each upon machines which are exported for <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline> 9s. 6d.  each. The old duty upon that consignment, instead of amounting to ;&#163;i8o, would have amounted <inline font-style="italic">t0 &#163;43</inline> 7S.  6d.  The protectionist section of the Tariff Commission recommend a duty upon this item of  25  per cent. We must not seriously regard the alternative duty of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline> per machine recommended by that body. As the honorable member for Yarra suggested, it was framed with a view <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> prevent dumping. Now, assuming that a consignment of bicycles were invoiced at <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> each or a little over, instead of a duty of  25  per cent, being charged upon them - which was the rate assumed by the Commission to be necessary for protection - the Customs authorities would have power, under the original proposal of the Government, to penalize the importer of these dumped machines by imposing a duty upon them of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline> each. That is a very large power to place in the hands of a Minister, because by an arbitrary assessment of value upon a mere allegation that dumping was taking place he would be able without the importer having a right to appeal to charge a duty of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline> per machine. This is a power, which ought not to be granted to him. I say, therefore, that the true duty recommended by the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission was  25  per cent., and I do not think that we shall be acting wrongly if we adopt that rate. </para>

                        <para>- It was the rate recommended without any qualification whatever. I am assured that <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline> 9s. 6d.  per machine represents the fair value of a good bicycle, and that it is the true import price is shown by the invoice to which I have alluded. Under the circumstances, I think that we might very well accept the recommendation of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission, and grant preferential treatment to the imports from the United Kingdom. That the duties originally scheduled were too high is evidenced by the fact that the Government are prepared, without debate, to accept, in lieu thereof, 35 per cent, under the general Tariff and 30 per cent, under the Tariff for the United Kingdom. Under the circumstances, I think that the Committee might agree to 30 per cent, and 25 per cent, respectively, and I shall move accordingly. Thirty per cent, would represent an increase of 10 per cent, upon the old rate of duty. If any further concession is to be made to the bicycle industry - and we ought to recollect that there is a very large section of the public who use bicycles as a part of their implements of trade - I suggest that it should take the form of a reduced duty upon the parts. </para>

                    <para>.- It has been said that bicycle-building in the Commonwealth merely consists of assembling the parts and undertaking the brazing, nickelling, and enamelling of the machines. Of course, in some cases alterations are made in the design of the bicycles, and the tubes are cut by those who import them. Generally speaking, however; the tubes are cut to length. If there were a chance of the industry of manufacturing the parts being established in Australia, I should be very pleased to assist in imposing a reasonable duty upon those parts, because it would be an industry worth encouraging. But, as has been already pointed out, the parts are all standardized, and there is not much probability that in the near future these parts will be made in the Commonwealth. They are imported chiefly from the Birmingham Small Arms Factory. The Government have certainly done the right thing in abandoning the fixed duties of  &#163;5  and , &#163;5 5s. originally proposed. As has been pointed out by the honorable member for Parramatta, the cost of the work done here upon a single machine amounts to about 24s. So that to levy a duty of &#163;5 or  &#163;5  5s. upon each bicycle would be utterly ridiculous. The figures quoted by the honorable member for Parramatta correspond almost exactly with those supplied to me by a bicycle builder in Adelaide. </para>

                        <para>-  Does the cost quoted by the honorable member cover the enamelling ? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. BATCHELOR.</inline> - Yes. The enamelling costs about 9s. per machine. Seeing that we are not likely to go in for the manufacture of bicycle parts, I should prefer to make the duty upon bicycles 30 per cent, under the general Tariff and 25 per cent. under the Tariff for the United Kingdom, and to lower the rates upon the parts to 10 per cent. and 5 per cent, respectively. The imposition of a small duty might encourage the manufacture of some of the parts locally. Our best course, therefore, is to levy the duties which I have indicated upon bicycles, and to reduce the rates upon the parts at any rate to 10 and 5 per cent., if not to abolish them. There does not seem to be a sufficient reason for a duty as. high as 10 per cent, on the parts which cannot be made here, at any rate for a few years. The only reason which the Treasurer has given for increasing the duties on the finished article up to 35 and 30 per cent, is because he has duties of 15 and 10 per cent, on the parts. It seems to me that the better method would be, instead of increasing the total cost of the article to the user, to reduce it by making the duties on the finished goods 30 and 25 per cent. and the duties on the parts 10 and 5 per cent. </para>

                    <para>.- Seeing that the Treasurer has decided to abandon the fixed duties, 1 do not wish to argue the question at any great length. The reason which induced the A section of the Tariff Commission to propose the fixed duties was that they should operate on a large number of cheap, unserviceable, and dangerous bicycles, some of them being as low in value as &#163;2, &#163;3, and We realized that <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties of 25 or 20 per cent, on such goods would be practically inoperative. </para>

                        <para>- We did not desire to give protection by proposing the fixed duties, but to assist in keeping out undesirable bicycles. I am sorry that the Treasurer has seen fit to abandon the fixed duties, because I know that in this Tariff no proposition has worked more effectively and successfully than have those duties. I know that they have had the result of stimulating the bicycle-making industry in various parts of Australia. I have seen letters in the press and telegrams from all parts congratulating the Government upon imposing duties which are so effective and successful in, their operation. However, the Minister is responsible, and , I do not intend to fall out with him. This industry seems to present scope for large development and expansion. In Victoria there are no less than a* thousand persons employed in the repairing and making of bicycles, motor cars, and motor cycles. I do not know the number in other States, but I feel deeply impressed with the possibilities of the industry. An idea of those possibilities may be gathered from the fact that during the last two or three years bicycles and motor cycles to the value of over ,&#163;250,000 have been imported. That shows that there was a wide area of trade for a good sound protective duty to operate upon. And these fixed duties were undoubtedly the most effective and operative part of these proposals. The  deputy  leader of the Opposition has challenged my reply regarding the work and labour involved in this industry. I think he said that it cost only 12s. or 13s. to assemble or put together the various parts of a bicycle. </para>

                        <para>- .Of course, the amount that is spent locally in building a bicycle depends upon whether finished or unfinished parts are utilized. If the parts are finished, no doubt the work involved is not so great as would be the case if the parts were unfinished. But it is claimed that in building a bicycle out of imported unfinished parts every cycle manufacturer in the Commonwealth gives at least thirty-six hours&#39; employment to Australian workmen. That is an incentive to manufacturers to build factories, and provide plant locally made or imported, giving work to a considerable number of men in the production of bicycles. </para>

                        <para>- That is notorious sweating with which I, like the honorable member, have no sympathy. We do not want that, and I believe it is the desire and intention of the owners of bicycle factories, if these duties are imposed, to give their workers good and substantial wages. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. I have explained the reason why the fixed duties were recommended, and that was practically to check the importation of dangerous, unserviceable, and cheap machines. And with reference to high class and expensive machines, the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties of 30 and 25 per cent, were intended to operate. </para>

                        <para>- I have said that my object was to keep out the dangerous rubbish; but the exclusion of that would rather tend to encourage the local production of superior machines. I know as a fact that the local manufacture of bicycles has resulted in a great decline in the prices of them to the general public. I remember the time - and it is only a few years ago - when I gave &#163;32 for an ordinary bicycle, but to-day I could buy the same machine in Bendigo - perhaps, a better one - for&#163;15 or , &#163;20, simply owing to local manufacture and competition. </para>

                        <para>- If this trade were in the hands of bicycle importers there would be a great danger of the prices being raised to the old standard, whereas the local manufacturer of them has undoubtedly tended to bring down the cost, and the public have had an advantage thereby. I hope that the Minister having given way on the fixed duties does not intend to go below 35 per cent. I hope that he will accept the invitation of the freetrade party and lower the duties on the parts both finished and unfinished. That to some extent would be a slight compensation to local manufacturers for the removal of the fixed duties. </para>

                    <para>. - I am surprised at so much heat being imported into this discussion. I felt that the fixed- duties of &#163;5 5s, and &#163;5 were very excessive, and I do not care who says the reverse. On looking through the Tariffs of other countries, I found that bicycles were not subjected to a fixed duty but to an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty. In Victoria under its old Tariff there was a much lower <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty than ours, and in New Zealand, Canada and the United States of America there is an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty. </para>

                        <para>- Canada has a duty of 35 and 30 per cent., while New Zealand has a duty of 20 per cent. Under the old Victorian Tariff it was 10 per cent., and under our old Tariff it was 20 per cent. If the consensus of opinion in all those countries is in favour of an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty, I conceive that I cannot go far wrong in following their example. I am as anxious as is any one to see a good duty imposed on any article which we can and do make. With regard to bicycles some honorable members have said that they would rather have a fixed duty of &#163;1 than an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty. Let us see how it would work out. Suppose that I get the Committee to agree to duties of 35 and 30 per cent. A bicycle is imported worth &#163;3, and that will have a duty of &#163;1 upon it even at that very low estimated value. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think so. I am sure that honorable members will give me credit for trying to deal with this matter in a practical way. We cannot do better than adopt the method which has been pursued all over the British Dominions and in the United States. I think myself, despite what has been said, that duties of 35 and 30 per cent, are very good rates indeed. Those who are interested in this industry ought to be very, well satisfied, and think themselves lucky to get such duties. That is the feeling that I have. </para>

I have not been able to ascertain what is necessary, but by the time we reach the item dealing with parts I shall be able to make a statement, explaining what reduction I intend to move, if any. I firmly believe in leaving a good margin between the duty on the bicycle and that on parts. Probably a reduction of the duty on parts will make this duty more acceptable to those who are complaining at present. . I move - </para>

                    WILLIS (Robertson) slipping away from his high protectionist principles. He originally proposed a duty of
                    <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5,</inline>
                    and now he comes down to one of ios. He really does not seem to know where he is. The honorable member for Bendigo tells us that bicycles can be brought to this country for a mere bagatelle, and that it was because of the importation of these weak and dangerous machines that he proposed a fixed duty. But the honorable member evidently forgot that these inferior machines can be imported in parts and made up here, when they can be sold more cheaply than the good machines, with which they compete. It seems to me, however, that this item does not merit so much discussion as has been devoted to it. If we make the duty high, and the parts are put together here, and it only costs 24s. to put them together, it seems to me that there will be no demand for complete imported machines. The freight alone would make it almost prohibitive to import them as compared with the cost of putting together the parts here. The honorable member for Bendigo has told us that it takes a man thirty-six hours to put a machine together. The honorable member for Parramatta says that it costs 24s. to put a machine together. The honorable member for Boothby also says that the cost of building a bicycle from imported parts is 24s., and he speaks as a practical man. Evidently, if it takes thirty-six hours to construct a machine, and the wages paid are 8d. an hour, that works out at 24s. If the Committee wish to do something for the benefit of the industry, they should&#39; give it the parts free. Then it will flourish, and locally-built machines must take the place of importations. Therefore, when we reach item 375 I shall support the proposition that parts lie admitted free, so that all the bicycles required in Australia may be made in the country. There is no advantage in importing machines if they can be put together in Australia. We have been told that bicycles are dumped into Australia. It is a remarkable thing that I never get any of these goods dumped into my backyard. I never have a chance of buying dumped goods. But a few years ago I looked into a bicycle factory at Coventry, England, where the best machines in the world are made, and the head of the firm told me that they could have sold 5,000 more machines during the year if they had had time to make them. I have never yet heard of an up&#62;-to-date machine being dumped into any country. It is the out-of-date machine that will be dumped, to get rid of it. This story about goods being dumped into Australia is a mere fiction, and I hope that the Committee will not be induced to&#39; believe it. However, I am more interested in item 375 than in that under consideration. I should like the duties to be made as low as possible. Whether we make the duty high or low on this item, however, it will not make a bit of difference, so long, as we make the duty on parts low.

In fact, it appears that in every electorate around Melbourne there are bicycle factories. In South Melbourne there seems to be one in every back yard. But while a good deal has been said about the necessity for protecting the industry, only one or two honorable members have pleaded the cause of the consumer. </para>

                        <para>- I never rode a better machine, and I have ridden a few and travelled a good many miles on them. In my electorate nearly every man you meet who is not &#34;waltzing Matilda&#34; rides a bicycle. At every station to which the shearers go there is a shed for the bicycles. Many men are now giving up the ordinary machine and going in for the motor cycle. As in some cases they have to ride 70 and 80 miles a day over a bush road, their interests ought to be taken into consideration as well as those of the manufacturers in Melbourne, Sydney or Brisbane. But I have not heard the honorable member for Bendigo say a word in the interest&#39;s of the men who have to buy these machines. The honorable member&#39;s anxiety appears to be limited to what can be got for Victoria. The arguments used with regard to the bicycle trade strike me as really very curious. As soon as those engaged in it prove that their industry is in a flourishing condition some honorable members are prepared to protect them. The industry was flourishing in New South Wales under freetrade, and even in Victoria in the palmy days of protection there was a duty of only  10  per cent. Now, however, under the Deakin Government, and with a New South Wales protectionist Treasurer, we have proposed a duty of  35  per cent. </para>

                        <para>- He has seen the error of his ways since then. Now, -what about the wages paid in this industry which the honorable member for Bendigo is so anxious to protect against the cheap imported article? The &#34; reputable employers section&#34; of the  Victorian Factories Act limits the power of the Wages Boards to fix rates of wages to those paid by the average employer in the trade. The &#39;wages paid to-day in the bicycle trade are higher than those fixed by the Board. I shall state what the wages fixed by the Board are. I ask the Committee whether it is fair, reasonable and reputable to expect a man with five children to live in &#39;Melbourne on <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> 7s.  6d. a week? A foreman bicycle-maker, who must be a mechanic, has had his wages fixed at <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> 8s.  per week. That is considered sufficient for the man who bosses the show. I pay a boundary-rider more than that for sitting on a horse and riding round my fences. The assemblers of bicycle parts get <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> 12s.  per week, filers <inline font-style="italic">j&#163;i</inline> 8s.,  persons engaged in building, turning, and fitting, or who are employed in addition thereto at other branches of the trade, get <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> os. 6d. This is the industry the honorable member for Bendigo is raving about. I say that if it cannot afford to pay better wages than these the sooner it is wiped out the better, in order that the men at present engaged in it may be able to turn their attention to some more profitable employment. Repairers get <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> 15s.  per week. Wheel builders <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> 8s.  6d., and all other adults engaged in the industry <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> 7s.  6d. Apprentices, who are unlimited, get from  5s.  to  25s.  per week, and improvers, who are allowed in the ratio of one to one or two adults, two to three adults, and one for every additional adult, get from  5s.  to  28s.  . per week, according to experience. I have heard the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, where the majority of these bicycle shops are to be found, say times out of number that if he had his way he would wipe out an industry that could not pay better wages than these. I desire that the workers engaged in the industry, and the people who buy and ride bicycles, as well as the people who build and . sell them, should get some of the benefit conferred by the protection proposed. We know that many of these bicycles are made of tin tubes. A man in Rockhampton wanted to sell me a bicycle which he said would carry a ton. He gave me a trial, and I brought it back to him like a concertina. This was a Colonial-made bicycle, and it is clear, therefore, that the remarks of the honorable member for Bendigo about cheap imported bicycles should not carry much weight. I am pleased that the Treasurer has seen fit to abolish the fixed duties proposed. It rests now with the Committee to decide what the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties shall be. I have no wish to crush the local bicycle industry. I am prepared to vote for a reasonable duty for its protection, and if, under the old Victorian duty of  10  per cent, the industry could be carried on, those concerned in it should be satisfied with a duty of  2.5  per cent., for which I arn prepared to vote. </para>

                    <para>.- I feel sure that the arguments of the  Chairman  of the Tariff Commission will have great weight with the Committee. I hope that if the fixed duties are removed the honorable member&#39;s colleagues on the Tariff Commission will in another place be successful in reintroducing them, or at least in providing for a fixed duty of  3s.  on each machine. The object is to prevent the introduction of very cheap and worthless bicycles. I have seen bicycles advertised in the London press as low as <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> ios., <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> 2s.,  and even <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> 5s.  If the parts of such machines were sent out here no self-respecting local manufacturer would use them. He would have to consider his good name, and in the interests of his business he could not afford to put such rubbish into a machine. We know that a certain amount of enamel will cover a great many faults, and worthless bicycles are imported which in appearance look spick and span. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable member will compare the price of locally-made tires with the price charged for imported tires, he will- find that the locally-made article is cheaper than the imported article. In the same way, as the result of the operation of the duty and the extended manufacture of bicycles in the Commonwealth, they can be sold now at less than the price asked for imported machines. I suppose the Government will carry the proposal to abolish the fixed duties of and <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline> 5s. ; but I suggest that they should be replaced by a fixed duty of ^3 3s.,  to  prevent the introduction df cheap and worthless bicycles. Bicycle parts, which cannot be manufactured here, should be admitted free, and if that is done, the assemblers  of the parts in the Commonwealth will be given a sufficient margin  of  protection for their work, and will have no reason to be discontented. </para>

                    <para>. - The present proposal of the  Treasurer  is not calculated to help this industry to flourish and pay decent wages. Every time the honorable gentleman departs from the admirably -prepared Tariff put in front of him he gets into difficulties, and makes statements which are not corroborated from outside sources. Two&#34; kinds of bicycles are imported : Those that are good and those that are no good. Those that are no good, and that really describes them, are imported at an invoice price of from .&#163;3 to ,&#163;5. I have known an individual obtain a bicycle from  a  Coventry firm landed here at &#163;$, and we can assume that the purchaser of a large  number  of these machines would get them  for very  much less.. A duty of 30 per cent, would represent about <inline font-style="italic">&#163;,1</inline> 10s. on such a machine, and under that duty it would cost landed in Australia <inline font-style="italic">&#163;fi</inline> 10s. at the outside. How is a local manufacturer to pay decent wages if he is to make a bicycle for <inline font-style="italic">&#163;.6</inline> 10s. ? I do not know how it is to be done. I have known bicycles to be sold for 22s. 6d., and all I can say is that if a manufacturer pays his workmen decent mechanics&#39; wages, .he cannot turn out a bicycle for 22s. 6d. I have never made bicycles myself, but I have done metal work, and I know that a bicycle could not be turned out at the price mentioned. I point out that if a specific duty of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline> were imposed on a machine invoiced, at <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5,</inline> the effect would be to keep such machines out. A man who desires an imported machine wishes to have a first-class bicycle, which would be sold ait about &#163;20, and the duty of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline> would not put the machine beyond him. A duty of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline> on the lower-priced machines would prevent their sale, and the market would thus be kept for the local manufacturer, and if he could make a better class of machine so much the better. However, when the Treasurer has formed a base mercenary alliance with the Opposition, there is nothing left for a free-trader like me to do but to follow him. I very much regret that one by one the old landmarks are becoming submerged in this chamber. We find honorable members making speeches in support of free  Oregon,  and then proposing a duty of 6d. per 100 superficial feet, and afterwards declaring that they do not care a &#34; continental &#34; how things go. If we intend to do anything for this industry, we should give it such protection as will enable the local manufacturers of bicycles to pay decent wages. </para>

                    <para>.- This item affects the wealthy classes of the community not so much as it does the poorer sections. Perambulators and go-carts are used mostly by the middle and poorer&#39; classes, for our wealthy citizens have other means of conveyance for their infants. I am surprised that a Government which proposes to expend  , &#163;200,000  to encourage immigration is prepared to impose a prohibitive tax upon the perambulators and go-carts of the rising generation. </para>

                    <para>.- I think the Committee have made an error regarding this and the last item. The words &#34; and parts thereof &#34; should have been transferred from the last item to this, and &#34;perambulator and go-cart body&#34; should have been in the other item, both items carrying <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties. I believe that certain parts of these vehicles are not made here. There was a great discussion in the press when the Tariff was introduced as to whether the under gear was or was not made here. I am not sure now whether it is made here or not, but at any rate the parts should not be dutiable at as high a rate as is the finished article. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that Councillor Gardiner, of North Melbourne, does make some parts of perambulators. If this item is made dutiable at a lower rate than the previous one, I suggest that the Treasurer should make inquiries and, if he finds that there is an anomaly, have it rectified in another place. </para>

                    <para>.- I suggest that the word &#39; &#39; unplated &#34; be struck out, and &#39; &#39; unfinished &#34; substituted before the word &#34; parts.&#34; If the Treasurer rnakes inquiries amongst his officers, he will find that the word &#34; unplated &#34; in this connexion caused endless confusion in the Department. Any part which had the least bit of plating on it had to fall under a higher duty ; and I do not think that is the desire of the Committee. </para>

                    <para>.- I think that the word &#34; unfinished,&#34; inserted on the suggestion of the honorable member for Yarra, is not at all suitable, in view of the fact that these are all finished parts, though some of them may be unplated. The whole object of admitting these parts free will Le defeated if the word &#34; unfinished &#34; be allowed to remain. </para>

                        <para>- Then I think the division will provoke some debate, because, in view of previous decisions, uniformity ought to be preserved. I should be quite prepared, in the case of paragraph  a,  to vote for duties of  30  per cent, and  25  per cent., which would be an- increase of  5  per cent, on the old duties. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt the vehicle industry has progressed considerably, and there is very little importation; but that only provides a reason why the Treasurer should not propose duties so high. Under the old Tariff, vehicles to the value of  &#163;2,500,000  per annum were made in the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>. - Dog carts, gigs, tilburys, and other two-wheeled vehicles are imported to a larger extent than &#34;almost any other kind of vehicles, and are sold at  ;&#163;io,  and. sometimes less. They are the easiest class of vehicles to construct,, and, therefore, an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty would be of no avail Some honorable members may think the&#39; proposed duty high,, but, in my opinion, every one of those cheap articles ought to be made here. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; and previously they were admitted free, whereas they are now dutiable at 30 per cent. In the same way, bent poles were previously admitted free; but they are now subject to a duty of 2s. 6d. each. The coachbuilders, therefore, do not now occupy the position that they formerly occupied. The cost of their Haw material has been increased, and consequently it becomes necessary to increase the duty upon the manufactured article: If we desire to have these vehicles manufactured locally, we should retain the fixed duty proposed by the Government. </para>

I am speaking of the value of the completed vehicles imported, and I have quoted the figures supplied by the Customs Department. The total value of the trade, I am informed, is &#163;2, 500,000 annually. Our coachbuilders have captured that trade under the old rates of duty. </para>

                        <para>- It seems to me that they have already captured the trade. I hope that they will continue to ma.ke all the vehicles required in the Commonwealth. But as that they are already doing that, it seems the height of absurdity to increase these duties. The specific duties proposed by the Treasurer are unreasonable. To associate fixed duties with values which are necessarily varying is an act of absurdity. To tax a vehicle which costs <inline font-style="italic">&#163;10</inline> at the same amount, as one which costs ^70 or ^80 is perfectly preposterous. I know that fixed duties are very convenient from .the Customs stand-point, but that fact should not be permitted to prevent us from doing justice all round. </para>

I trust that we shall abolish the fixed duties in respect pf vehicles and revert to the old rate of 25 per cent, which I think will afford the industry ample protection.

I am quite prepared to support an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rate of 35 or 40 per cent, in view of the fact that we have already increased the cost of the construction of these vehicles. </para>

                    <para>.- With the exception of the very highest class of vehicles, such as barouches and landaus, and some of the cheaper classes of buggies, there is a very small importation of vehicles into the Commonwealth. The reason is that the foreign vehicles are built too lightly to withstand use on Australian roads. </para>

                        <para>- Undoubtedly the cost of importation is considerable, because vehicles take up a large quantity of space. If we compare the importation of vehicles into the Commonwealth prior to Federation with the present importation, we shall find that there has been a tremendous falling-off. From the <inline font-style="italic">Statistical Register</inline> I gather that in j 900 the value of the importations under this heading was as follows: - New South Wales &#163;11,382. Victoria &#163;5,902&#62; Queensland &#163;1,436&#34;, South Australia .&#163;5,669, Western Australia &#163;1,113, and Tasmania &#163;96, or a total of &#163;25,600. From the Trade and Customs Returns I gather that the imports last year from the United Kingdom were valued at &#163;1,274, those from the United States at &#163;8,117, and those from all other countries at &#163;208, or a total of &#163;9,599. As against this total there were re-exports to the extent of &#163;92j which really reduced the value of the total imports last year to &#163;9&#187;5&#176;7, as against &#163;25,600 for 1900. In regard to the opinions of the coachbuilders, some evidence which was given before the Victorian Tariff Board is very interesting reading just now. It shows that even so far back as then, when the industry was not in nearly so flourishing a condition as it is in to-day, the coachbuilders did not want any more protection. In fact, many of them complained that the high Tariff was really a source of irritation to them, if it did not indeed involve them in considerable loss. </para>

At that time they had much greater competition from abroad than they have to-day, the importations having fallen from ,&#163;25,600 to &#163;9,000 worth.

                <para class="block">I could quote passage after passage to the like effect from other witnesses in the trade all over Victoria, if honorable members desired, but I think that the evidence I have cited is sufficiently convincing to show even the most ardent protectionist that no duty at all is required. The Minister has not given any reason why the old duty should be increased, nor is the increase supported by anything I have seen in the reports of the Tariff Commission. So far as I can learn there has not been any demand for the additional duty. Therefore I shall do what I can not only to oppose the increased duty but to try to get a reduction. </para>

                        <para>- That is exactly what I have said. What we ought to do is to provide that on and after the nth December the duty be  25  per cent. If it is put in that way the provision will be perfectly valid. The Act which we shall pass embodying the Tariff will validate what has been done in the past; but as the proposal stands at present we shall be striking out the basis upon which the specific duty has been levied during the last few months. </para>

                    <para>. - We have two points to consider, first whether we will depart from the general principle of this Tariff, and adopt a specific duty in lieu of an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rate; and secondly what the duty is to be. I am glad to know that the attention of the Committee has been centered upon the issue whether we shall adopt an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rate instead of a specific duty. The point raised by the honorable member for Angas may, I think, be met in the way he suggests, or by adopting the suggestion of the honorable member for Dalley, and testing the feeling of the Committee upon the question of eliminating the word &#34; each.&#34; If the word is struck out we might insert the provision that on and after nth December, an <inline font-style="italic">ad&#39; valorem</inline> rate be imposed. W&#39;ith respect to the question of specific duties, as against an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty, I invite the attention of the Committee to the fact that practically the decision of the Committee, so far has been adverse to the adoption of specific duties. In addition, the coachbuilders themselves who are primarily affected are in favour of an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rate. I find from a circular which they have issued that the Master Coachbuilders and Wheelwrights&#39; Association felt so much &#39; interested in this particular matter that, after the trade in Victoria and New South Wales had considered it, they held a conference in Melbourne, with the object of making certain representations to the Minister. I find that they were unanimously in favour of an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> dutv as against a specific rate. When a previous item was under consideration it was proposed to place a specific duty on shafts, poles, and so forth, but the Committee decided to eliminate the specific duty, and impose an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rate. I think honorable members will be wise in continuing the policy thus initiated in regard to the item under review. The Minister seems to be afraid that a number of importations of manufactured buggies or conveyances of different kinds would enter into serious competition with: the local manufacturers if the specific duties were abolished. The best authorities on that point are the manufacturers themselves. In their circular they say that the annual consumption of carriages, waggons, drays, and so forth amounts to no less a sum than &#163;2, 000,000, or, including repairs, &#163;2,500,000 per annum. On that large amount of consumption the imports that entered into competition last year have been reduced to less than &#163;10,000. According to the Minister&#39;s returns, the imports for the year 1906 were only , &#163;9.500. The honorable member for Lang has informed the Committee that, according to the Commonwealth statistics, prior to the introduction of the first uniform Tariff the importations amounted to something like &#163;25,600. </para>

                        <para>- The figures were partly, but not wholly, accounted for by the free importations into New South Wales. The total imports into New South Wales were about &#163;11,000 out of a total of &#163;25,000. Since the imposition of the duty of 25 per cent, under the old Tariff, the imports have been reduced down to the very small figure of , &#163;9,500 in a total consumption of &#163;2,500,000 per annum. Those figures show how completely the local manufacturers have . captured the trade, and that they have nothing to fear from importations on the basis of the old Tariff. The members of the trade who have issued this circular, indicate that they wish to have the whole matter adjusted on an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> basis. The circular is signed by F. Skinner, W. H. Stevens, Dan White, F. C Wilmot, and J. W. Waring, on behalf of the Master Coachbuilders and Wheelwrights&#39; Association of Victoria, and by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. G.</inline> H. Olding, on behalf of a special meeting of Sydney Master Coachbuilders, held on 23rd August, 1907. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Olding</inline> also, I am informed, represented eighteen leading coachbuilders of New South Wales, who do not belong to the association, but who commissioned him to represent their views as being identical with those of the Association. In addition, if the evidence taken before the Tariff Commission be examined, it will be found that testimony was tendered on behalf of the South Australian, association identical with the recommendations of the conference. In view of this expert evidence, I trust that, first of all, the Committee will adopt the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> method in preference to the specific duty proposed by the Treasurer. The great injustice that will be inflicted by the adoption of the Minister&#39;s proposal is that the cheaper conveyances will bear the same amount of taxation as will the more expensive ones. No distinction is drawn; and that means that the taxation will fall heavier upon those who are compelled to use the cheaper conveyances, such as sulkies, dogcarts, and spring carts, which are generally used in the country districts rather than in the cities, and especially by graziers and settlers, to do their tighter work. </para>

I understand that the honorable member desires first of all to test the principle whether we shall have an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> or a fixed duty. His idea, therefore, is to eliminate the word &#34; each,&#34; but it governs the whole item, and I point out that to protect the. revenue it is necessary to keep the item intact.

                <para class="block">In the old Tariff, axles and springs were dealt with separately, being dutiable at 15 per cent. I do not suggest that we should go back to the old duty, but I am of opinion that in this, as in the old Tariff, we should differentiate between the raw material and the finished article. Carriages and conveyances might well be dutiable at the rate set down, but axles and springs should be taxed at a lower rate. We should give the same treatment to axles and springs as to buggy parts. Axles are imported in halves or &#34; arms,&#34; and are welded together and adapted to the various width&#39;s of vehicles by the local coachsmiths. </para>

                        <para>- Axles are raw material to coachbuilders, who should be able to obtain them as cheaply as possible. There are at least 180 different patterns, and surely no honorable member will contend that&#34; we have here factories which can turn out so many patterns. I desire that axles and springs shall be treated in the same way as buggy shafts and parts. Springs come out in bundles, and, of course, the rates which I wish to impose would apply only to bulk importations. As a freetrader, I am going a great way to meet protectionists in what I have proposed. </para>

                    <para>. - Ina communication which I have had from a large coachmaker in my electorate, he points out that this item covers a good deal of material used by coachmakers which must be imported. He says that a difference must be made between the raw material of the coachbuilder and the manufactured article, and that a good deal of raw material which was dutiable at 15 per cent, is now dutiable at 30 and 25 per cent. He would like to see the old duty continued, and suggests that this paragraph should be subdivided into three <inline font-style="italic">sections,</inline> the first dealing with carriages, conveyances, traps, and parts n.e.i., and the second with vehicle parts n.e.i. not previously fitted to any vehicle. That proposal is intended to overcome a difficulty experienced under the old Tariff, by preventing the introduction of parts brought in so finished that they had simply to be put together. The third subdivision would deal with axles and arms not welded together, in lots of not less than a dozen each. </para>

                        <para>- The steel is imported shaped ready for use, and the so-called making consists of turning it into shape. Most of the axles for light conveyances come from America, and those for large vehicles from England. There are only a couple of places in- Melbourne where axles are made, and the making is a very little matter. The axle-making industry in Australia is really, a small thing, and it would be a serious matter to penalize the coachbuilders of the Commonwealth, in order to protect it. The coachbuilders, in the country districts, at all events, desire to obtain axles and other buggy parts at lower rates of duty than are charged on finished vehicles, so that they may have a sufficient margin to enable them to compete against manufacturers abroad. What is required is a difference in the duty imposed on parts which require to be fitted together, chiefly on axles, and the duty imposed on the same parts when imported in a completed vehicle. I hope the Minister will agree to some distinction being made for the protection of manufacturers who import these parts as their raw material. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Calare cannot be making his appeal in the interest of the consumer, who would not be benefited by what he proposes, but in the interests of persons who desire that the coachbuilding industry, instead&#34; of being an industry for the complete manufacture of vehicles, should be merely one for the assembling of parts of vehicles. That is the very thing we should try to avoid. The manufacture of axles was really one of the strangled industries. Under the legislation of the States it enjoyed a pretty high measure of protection and was well established, but under the  1 5  per cent, duty of the last Commonwealth Tariff its continuance was endangered. </para>

                        <para>- The plant required is not expensive, and there is no reason why coachbuilders generally should not also manufacture axles. If we give them sufficient protection they will do so, but they are unable to do so with a duty of only  15  per cent. It should be mentioned that as a matter of fact patent axles, though correctly described as such when we were boys, no longer exist, because the patents have run out, and they can be and are being made here. </para>

                    <para>. - Is there any need for such high duties on buggy hoods? The proposal is absurd. A continuance of this kind of thing would make anybody not only tired and bored, but sick to death. A duty of 35 per cent, is proposed on one of the simplest forms of manufacture, when we have -put only 25 per cent, on some of the most complicated forms of manufacture in Australia, requiring the greatest possible :skill and ingenuity in construction. I shall propose duties of 25 per cent.&#39; and 20 per cent. </para>
