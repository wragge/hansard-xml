                        <para>- I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether, in contemplating the completion of a new European Mail Contract for a term of five or seven years, he has taken into consideration the fact that the rate of speed which it is stated the vessels will probably maintain, namely, sixteen knots, is the very minimum which should be insisted upon, seeing that at the end of the period over which the contract will extend it will be notoriously behind the requirements of the age? I also wish to know whether he will not stipulate that the vessels shall be capable of steaming more than sixteen knots, even if the maintenance of an increased speed should necessitate the payment of a higher subsidy ? </para>

                    <para>.- There is really no reason why the proposed increase in the duty upon condensed milk should be adopted. I fail utterly to understand the motive of the Treasurer in proposing such an increase. Under the old Tariff the condensed milk industry was a particularly flourishing one. This question was very carefully investigated by the Tariff Commission, whose members in their report distinctly state that they cannot recommend any increase in the old rate. Under the previous Tariff the duty was1d. per lb., and the proposed duty represents an increase of '  50  per cent. We all know that condensed milk is an absolute necessity to our pioneers in the back blocks of Queensland, Western Australia, and New South Wales, and it would be exceedingly hard if they were penalized by the imposition of an additional duty upon that article. It is a curious fact that the condensed milk manufactured in the Commonwealth- excellent as it is in many ways if used immediately the tin is opened - will not keep for any length of time in hot weather, whereas the imported article will keep for a considerable time. </para>

                    <para>I have the honour to inform you that the matter of the proposed increased duties on the importation of condensed milk has been carefully considered by the Directors of the Standard Dairy Co. Great fears are entertained by them that any duty in excess of1d. per lb., as specified in the present Tariff, may ultimately prove most inimical to the interests of the industry. It is under the stimulus of the protective duty of1d. per lb. that the Standard Dairy has come into existence, and the Wyreema Condensed Milk Factory, on the Darling Downs, became established. </para>

                    <para>The duty of1d. ver lb., while permitting of the manufacturer competing against the product of cheap European labour, also affords him the means of paying a most remunerative price to the dairy farmer for his milk. On inquiry it would be found that in the various Australian States where this industry has been established the price paid for. whole milk is equivalent to from 5d. to 5½d. per gallon. That even the lowest figure is most remunerative may be gathered from the tact that farmers, even shareholders in prosperous butter factories, prefer to sell their whole milk at5d. rather than to send their cream to the butter factory and feed pigs with the by-product. </para>

                    <para>The difficulties in the successful working of condensed milk factories are very great, but are all of a scientific nature. Even in some old established factories, these difficulties have not yet- been overcome for the want of proper scientific guidance and the same cause has brought about the failure of many attempts made in the starting of such factories. But, as stated above, these difficulties are of a purely scientific nature, and no Tariff, however high it might be, could assist in overcoming them. Such high Tariff may cause, however, the production of a lot of inferior milk, which could only be sold at low rates and interfere with sound trade. </para>

                        <para>- It is rather late in the day for them to ask for it. Under the old duty of1d. per lb., the output of Australian condensed milk increased by leaps and bounds, and notwithstanding that in some districts the imported article remains longer in good condition, it is rapidly displacing imported milk. The Tariff Commission recommended that the duty should remain at1d. per lb., and a Conference of Experts on the Bounties Bill reported that the industry was firmly established and required no assistance in addition to the old substantial duty of1d. per lb. The Attorney-General, in moving the second reading of the Bounties Bill, distinctly said that in his opinion, this article required no further duty. I presume that the Treasurer holds himself responsible for that  statement. </para>

After fully weighing all these considerations, the members of the Conference agreed that it was not advisable to have any bonus on condensed milk. . . . It may be also pointed out that the production  of  condensed milk in Australia is increasing, and  that  the industry is in the hands of strong firms, who, aided by a substantial duty, appear to have no difficulty in holding their own against the imported article. </para>

                    <para>- I hope the Bill will be found to do so. It takes many streams to make a mighty river, and the Government believe that this Bill represents a stream which will be one of the purest contributions to that river. The Bill, as it was introduced last session, has been modified in several respects. Some of the items included in the previous Bill have been omitted on the recommendation of experts. We have omitted for example, . . . condensed milk. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable gentleman distinctly stated that, on the grounds disclosed in the report of the Conference of Experts, a bounty was not to be paid on condensed milk. The Government admitted that further assistance to the industry was unnecessary when they adopted the report of the Conference of Experts on the Bounties Bill, which recommended that no bounty was necessary in respect of condensed milk. Any increased duty must of necessity press heavily on those who work on the land - the labouring classes, who are the mainstay of the country. I think I have proved the great hardship which an increased duty would inflict on those engaged in pioneer industries, and I sincerely trust that the Committee will make a reduction in the impost. </para>

                <para class="block">Nestle's people and the companies over this item outside Parliament. A representative of Nestle's called upon me, and informed me that it was the intention of his firm to start this industry in every suitable spot in Australia. He described the sort of places which would be suitable, and told me that, having been to Bacchus Marsh, he intended to visit Gippsland.  His  desire was, he said, to establish the industry where there was good land, and where dairying was carried on by small farmers, who were not too scattered over the country. This gentleman also informed me that he had bought out, or had arranged to buy out, one company in Queensland, and that he intended to make further inquiries at Mudgee, and two or three other places in New South Wales. Circulars were issued by most of the companies engaged in this industry, asking that the duty should not be increased; and I take it that those circulars were due to the influence of the statements made by Nestle's representative during his travels throughout the States.I understand now, however, that this gentleman has, as it were, thrown over those companies with the exception of the one in Queensland ; and since then the companies have issued further circulars praying that the duty may be increased. I mention these facts in order that honorable members may know how people outside are influenced in regard to the Tariff. The letter read by the honorable member for Hunter discloses one of those instances in which competition is not desired. </para>

                        <para>-Yes ; and I dare say that since then the same company has issued another circular to an opposite effect. There is no doubt that preserved milk can be manufactured here, and that it is purchased as readily as the imported article. If, by means of an increased duty, we can give our dairymen, not larger profits, but a larger market, we shall be doing a very good work. All the statements  1  have made can be verified ; and I hope the Committee will agree to the increased duty. </para>

                    <para>.- I regret that the honorable member for Coolgardie is not in his place, because I know he has gone to considerable trouble in establishing a strong case in favour of the reduction of this duty. The honorable  member  has desired me, in his absence, to lay some of the information he has collected before the Committee ; and I have much pleasure in doing so. It is all very well for honorable members to say that we ought to have milk direct from the cow, but that is impossible in the back country, where miners and other pioneer workers are to be found, and where milk can be obtained only in condensed form. I do not say anything about the quality of the local articie, because I know nothing whatever about it. The Treasurer, as usual, has tried to besmirch those who take an opposite view in regard to this duty. It seems to me that every time the honorable gentleman rises he insinuates that those who do not agree with him are rogues - that only those on his side are honest. We have had enough of that sort of thing, and I can only say that if mud is cast about in this way more mud may come from other quarters. When the Treasurer was quoting the figures relating to- imports, he might have told us that, although preserved milk is an absolute necessity in thousands of places, and is, in many instances, the means of' saving infant life, the duty collected last year amounted to . £44,759. One of the immediate effects of the increased duty has been to raise the price of the commodity. I have here vouchers obtained by the honorable member for Coolgardie from various parts of the Commonwealth, which go to show that, as a direct result of the higher impost, preserved milk has been raised in price by½d. per tin. </para>

                    <para>.- As chairman of directors of a company which has pioneered this industry, I wish to say a few words in regard to the Australian manufacture of preserved milk. When the last Tariff was under discussion, I said very little, and did not vote on any item in which I was interested. But I was told by the press that I was foolish in doing so, and ever since it has b-en imputed to me that I did the very opposite, so that on this occasion  I  intend to give the Committee the benefit of any knowledge I may have in regard to any item, whether I am interested in it or not. </para>

                        <para>- If that statement was. made, it is an error. Our climatic conditions cause difficulties which at first it was found difficult to overcome; but now they have been overcome, and Australian milk if properly made will keep well. Of course, milk is not always . properly made, and I have even known large quantities of Nestle's milk go bad in Northern Queensland and to be thrown into a river. It must be remembered that the Australian preserved milk is made from milk the product of the dairies of the country and sugar which is produced in Australia, and is manufactured by Australian labour. The only imported material used in placing it on the market is the tin plate with which the cans are made and the timber used for the cases, though in some places Australian timber is used. </para>

                        <para>- We do not import timber; but we use what we find to be suitable, and that, at present, is imported timber. The Ministry who framed the first Tariff proposed a duty of1½d. per lb. on preserved milk, but through the determined exertions of the Nestle's Company', the rate was reduced. That company is a huge concern, one of the most powerful in Europe, with an enormous capital, and sometimes adopts methods of carrying on its business which are an imitation of those pursued by the Standard Oil Trust of America. Its milk is advertised all over Europe and the East. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt; but I am merely recounting the facts. It was overlooked that, although a protective duty of id. per lb. was. imposed, the local manufacturers of preserved milk - there are eight or ten factories - have to pay a heavy duty on the sugar used in the manufacture, which, for various reasons, costs from £6 to £8 a ton more than that used by manufactories abroad. As 40 per cent, of condensed milk consists of sugar, upon which the Australian manufacturer has to pay a high duty, the protection of1d. is thereby reduced. He is under other disabilities which I need not mention. So far from 1d. per lb. being an excessive duty, it is really a low one. But if the Nestle Company had abstained from taking the action which they have taken, I should have felt inclined to retain the old rate, seeing that the industry, has already been established. The total quantity of condensed milk consumed in Australia is about 400,000 cases annually. Of this quantity, Nestle's supplied about three-fourths, some years ago. But the Australian manufacturers have steadily forged ahead in the face of tremendous competition. I could mention instances in which agents of the  Nestle  Company have greatly reduced "the price of their milk to the extent of 3s. to 4s. per case in order to "squelch " the local product. </para>

                        <para>- It has a perfect right to do so. But it has no right to practically invite us to fall into its arms as if it were a saviour of the country after it has done all that it can to kill the industry here. I understand that this company has acquired an option over a place in Queensland. Of course I do not know what are the motives underlying the actions of certain persons who have forwarded circulars to honorable members in reference to this item. But I do know that one circular, which emanated from a gentleman at Bacchus Marsh, is strongly opposed to any increase of the duty, whilst another circular from the same source favours the adoption of exactly the opposite course. I cannot say whether the fact that the Nestle Company has acquired an option over certain concerns has not had some effect upon the views put forward by certain individuals at various times. Unless we are extremely careful we may do great harm to this industry, which has been established under most difficult circumstances. But for the fact that an attempt is to be made by this company to do in Australia what was done in Europe, namely, to overshadow and gradually "mop" up all the smaller manufactories, I should favour the retention of the old duty. </para>

                        <para>- shall have something to say upon that aspect of the matter upon another occasion. My own experience has been that the operation of a high duty has the effect of reducing prices, because it almost invariably leads to a reduction of the profit by stimulating over-production. To that extent it does not encourage the creation of combines. Let us suppose that we levy a high rate of duty upon this particular article. If its production is thereby confined to. Australia, the operation of that duty will not tend to the creation of a trust, for the reason that if a trust, were formed local competition would always lead to a new combination. </para>

                        <para>- There are only one or two great permanent Trusts in America, namely, the Standard Oil Trust and the Beef Trust, and they have stood only because they have acquired control of the means of transportation. Had they not acquired that control they would have gone the 'way of most other trusts. It is most instructive to study the history of trust's in America. Ninety per cent. of them are merely stock exchange speculations, promoted either for the purpose of pushing on to an unsuspecting public businesses which are in a condition of decadence, or for the purpose of raising prices. These concerns are always over-capitalized, and the result of their creation is that some new enterprising company ' very soon comes along which is free from the disability of over capitalization; and then the so-called trusts fall into the hands of the liquidators. I do not advise honorable members to adopt the duty of1d. per lb. or  2d.  per lb. or any other rate. But I have never known- a more barefaced attempt to damage a legitimate industry than that which was made with a certain measure of success by the Nestle Company. </para>

                        <para>- I am not. I say that in Australia condensed milk can be produced equal in quality to that produced in any other part of the world. Some eight or ten factories are in existence within the Commonwealth, but none of these have a very large output at the present time. This is owing to the difficulties with which they have had to contend. In the first place they have had to combat the prejudice which existed in favour of the European article. In this connexion I may say for the information of the honorable member for Hunter that formerly no stronger advocates of the use of the foreign article were to be found than were members of the medical profession. </para>

                        <para>- I am very glad to say that many of the members of the medical profession have now entirely changed their attitude towards the use of Australian condensed milk, and, as a result, the use of the Australian article has gradually come to be regarded with more favour by the people. I believe that the condensed milk produced in Australia, being newer than the imported milk, is the better article. The fact that it is used within a few weeks of the period when it is manufactured is undoubtedly a great recommendation, because condensed milk is a perishable product at the best. Australian condensed milk having gained the approval of the medical profession, the demand for it is now increasing. </para>

                        <para>- I was about to say when the honorable member interrupted, that because of the prejudice in its -favour, due to its reputation for quality, . it sells at a higher price than rules for locally produced milk. When I speak of "'prejudice" I have in mind that which may be a perfectly legitimate feeling, the feeling that an article is good and reliable ; but there are some whose prejudice in favour of one article leads them to decline -to judge another "on its merits. .The price of Nestle's milk has been from is. to is. 6d. per dozen tins, or, in other words, from id. to  1½d.  per lb. in excess of that at which local brands Rave been selling; but gradually, as the local brands of milk are becoming better known, the Nestle" Company has shown a tendency to reduce its price. Although, under the old Tariff, there was a duty of id. per lb. and formerly a duty of 2d. per lb. upon imported milk, the public have not had to pay the full, amount of the duty, or anything like it. As Nestle's correctly state, they have in the past been able ro command a better price than rules for the Australian production,- and that fact is" advanced as an argument against an increased duty. What the industry requires, however, is not an- increased price, but a larger output, and an extended field of operations. The . larger the area the larger the trade, and the lower "the cost of production. We already have  so many factories in existence that even if the duty were fixed at 6d. per <inline font-style="italic">lb.,</inline> I do not think that it would affect the selling price. Twelve months hence the competition amongst the lo'cal factories in existence would be sufficient to keep down the price to a reasonable rate, based, not upon the cost at which the article could be imported, but upon the rate at which it could be legitimately produced in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- ,1 think that they found that the pressure was becoming greater and greater. The old feeling that condensed milk cannot be well made in Australia still remains to a considerable extent, but since we are able to place on the London market the best dairy produce obtainable there, the contention that we cannot produce good milk is, to say the least, a curious one. It has been urged that a large proportion of our imports of preserved milk come from England. As a matter of fact, only a small proportion of the condensed milk consumed in England is made there. There are some factories in the Old  Coun-try,  but for the most part the condensed milk consumed there is imported from the Continent of Europe. According to the report of the Government Statistician last year 5,579,344 lbs. of  preserved milk' were imported from the United Kingdom into the Commonwealth. On glancing at the column headed " Country of Origin, ", I find, however, that of that quantity, representing - a value of £98,059, only £20,950 worth, or about 1,500,000 lbs.,, came from Great Britain. It is a curious fact that no -imports are shown as coming from Switzerland, but from France we had art importation of 3,041,746 lbs., representing a value of £56,635. The returns show, however, that of that quantity only £241 worth, representing about 2,000 or 3,000 lbs., was made in France. Honorable members, in determining what should be the preference granted to Great Britain.; should not lose sight of the fact that only a very small proportion of our imports are actually produced in the Old Country. The bulk of our' imports last year, which totalled 10,600,000 lbs., were' produced on the Continent of Europe. The honorable member for Parramatta referred to the heat displayed by me. I "do not think that I 'was at all heated." </para>

As a matter of fact,  neither I nar the company with which I am associated have had anything to do with the recommendation of a duty ; we have issued no circulars. The matter is one entirely for the Committee to determine. I am speaking as a representative of a dairying district, and I feel that I can honestly say that this industry is one that ought to receive every consideration. </para>

                <para class="block">One.  The constituent parts of sweetened  Or  condensed milk - milk and cane sugar - are staple products of Australia., in the production of which we have made considerable strides. But it appears to me that those who have spoken on this question are unable to appreciate the real difficulties that stand in the way of - the success of this industry, and the effect of the imposition of a duty upon it. I was very  Sorry  to hear the honorable member for Hunter, speak so slightingly of a native product.  His  criticism is one that is too common amongst Australians. A certain class of Australians are never tired of decrying the native products. I am proud to say that, although I am, and always have been,  a free-trader, I have always been among, those who purchase local goods in preference to imported articles. We all very well remember that at one time one had only to place the name  of  a local manufacturer on a tin of jam or jelly to at once make it anathema; the people would not look inside the tin. The fact that it did not come from Dundee  Or  Aberdeen, or from Crosse and Blackwell's factory,' was sufficient to condemn it. That was a very unfortunate state of affairs. It has been contended that by the imposition of a duty of 2¼d. per lb. this industry will rapidly expand. I must be . permitted to doubt the correctness of that contention. And I doubt it from the very best of reasons. I admit that at present the milk-producing industry is in an abnormal condition. It is obvious that when a dairyman can get nd. per gallon for his milk, as he can, at the present time, in New South Wales, he is not going to sell it to the Hawkesbury River Condensed Milk Company, or to any one else, for anything short of 1 id. </para>

                        <para>- Unfortunately, a mart cannot always obtain a market for fresh milk. It is obvious that the condensed milk factory cannot alford to give anything like that price, because those who buy at" nd. have to sell at from is. 6d. to 2s. Condensed milk will not permit of a charge of anything like nd. per gallon; I should say that the highest possible price would be 5|d. On the Hawkesbury, 'we are told,, suppliers of fresh milk are paid 20 .per cent, in advance of the existing prices. The existing price is 5d., so that 6d. is now being paid; and the reason is that on certain days, which are called stock days, the great distributors in the metropolis take the milk; and, while it is worth nd. to them, it is worth nothing to the man who might have it left on his hands, because pigs and calves cannot be fed on alternate days. Under- the circumstances, two or three days' supply of milk would be sold at 6d. ; but it does not pay 'to sell at 6d., though, of course, to take that price is better than to throw the milk into the paddock. Those engaged in selling fresh milk will never look forward to the condensed milk industry as a means of petting; rid of supplies. The bulk of the dairy trade is concerned, not with the sale of fresh milk, but with the sale of cream to butter factories, and for that cream about 4fd. a gallon is paid. At the outside, the condensed milk factory could pay only ¼d. or Jd. more, and it could not possibly absorb anything like the amount of milk poured into the creameries. The Tariff Commission pointed out very clearly that the establishment of condensed milk factories could only disturb the constant and regular supply to the butter factories, and the latter, without such a supply, must suffer. If the supply of milk were diverted .in such a way, the result would be that both the condensed milk factories and the butter factories would be in a state of semi-starvation. I do not deny that an increase in the duty might have the effect of starting more condensed milk factories,, but I do not think that it would have the effect of putting the industry, as such, on a better footing. In any case, I cannot see my way clear to vote for a duty of 2¼d. and 2d. ; nor can I support a duty of 1½d. and id., for the. reason that, although the Treasurer told us that 5,000,600 lbs. come from Great Britain, he omitted to mention the salient fact that only about "one-fourth of that condensed milk is -manufactured in Great Britain, the balance being from the Continent, and exported <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> the Old Country. Under the circumstances, any preference to Great Britain would be very flimsy, and would affect only about 1,400,000 lbs. out of  5,000,000  lbs. In my opinion, if the people of Australia are to be protected they should be protected thoroughly ; and, therefore, this one-fourth, which represents British manufacture, is not worth consideration. If we gave a really substantial preference of Jd., the tendency on the part of foreigners to export their goods here <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Great Britain would be very strong; and, therefore, I am not in favour of giving Great Britain any preference. I point out to the honorable member for Hunter that, according to general opinion, .the foreign condensed milk is better than the British; and, of course, a strong argument against the duty is that, while the Australian 'industry is being built up so as to cover the requirements of the whole Continent, we ought not to penalize the consumer. I do not think that we ought to impose a penalty on the consumer to the extent of seven-tenths of the total imports; and in my opinion there ought to be a duty of 1½d. all round. The Treasurer complained about the honorable member for Hunter reading his brief ; but the Treasurer himself knows absolutely nothing about the business, and he ought to be the last to criticise. A duty of It'd. all round would conserve the revenue, and, while protecting the consumer, would give the industry the stimulus it needs. </para>

                    <para>. - It is of great service that we have had a statement from the honorable member for Mernda, who has had long personal experience of the manufacture of condensed milk. We have also just had the advantage of a statement by a gentleman who, I suppose, represents the dairying industry of Australia, and who has put the case as affecting the producers in a clear way. Having  those two statements before them, honor able members will be considerably helped in arriving at a proper conclusion.' One of the results of the remarks of the honorable member for Mernda, who is interested in a condensed milk company, was that I got an urgent appeal to go out and be interviewed by the gentleman who represents Nestle's Company. I had not before the honour of this gentleman's acquaintance, but I thought it only fair when a gentleman interested in the colonial industry made statements affecting Nestle's Company, that the representative of the latter should be heard. I rather discourage interviews with manufacturers, and I do not think I have seen more than two or three since the discussion on the Tariff began; but, under the circumstances, I felt it was only fair to hear what this gentleman had to say. What I liked about the speech of the honorable member for Mernda was that he frankly told lis he was connected with one of the condensed milk companies. So long as honorable members know that fact, it is a source of information to them to have the benefit of the experience of a gentleman who has been practically engaged in building up the industry. I must say that I agree with the honorable member for West Sydney that this is an industry which ought to flourish in Australia, for the reasons he has mentioned, and that it is a most legitimate industry for any protective policy to embrace. But we must not forget that there are other ' considerations. We must not forget, that this item represents a necessity of life in the vast spaces of Australia where the cow is never seen. We, in the crowded centres, get, I have no doubt, the best of milk every day all the year round ; but people in distant parts are unable to get any but condensed milk. Then, all over Australia, condensed milk is sometimes a necessary of infant life, which I suppose we are all anxious to conserve as of as much importance as even the interests of shareholders in condensed milk companies. One of the curses of modern civilization is that, with all our enlightenment, we have not sufficiently cared for the purity of the commodities which the infantile population consume. In that aspect I look on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale's</inline> work with the most cordial approval. There has, I think, been an immense amount of good done by that gentleman's labours in this connexion.. </para>

                        <para>- That is a question of quality ; there is no charm to the infants in the brand on the tin. We must really leave the fiscal question when an infant is struggling for its life. The main point is the quality of the article ; and how can I express any opinion as to the quality of the respective brands'? We can, however, all proceed on certain broad lines, where we cannot go far wrong. For instance, the honorable member for Mernda says that Nestle's brand commands a higher price than other brands by1½d. per lb. That simple fact is a very eloquent one, because, out in the bush, the mother's idea, and very proper idea, is to get the best, whether it' be English, Swiss, or Australian milk. That mothers are prepared to pay the. higher price for Nestle's is a fact which, in itself, seems to show that that is the best article. But I understand that, regarded as a food for children, the main point is the uniform quality of the milk - that that is the vital point in regard to condensed milk just as if is with regard to natural milk. If it can be obtained from the one cow, so much the better, because I understand that medical authorities regard uniformity of quality as a special virtue in infants' foods. If Nestle's milk is the best on the market, the chances are that the company possesses a trade secret which enables it to produce a specially good article, because . the elementary conditions of manufacture are not complex, and there cannot be much mystery about them. I am glad to hear from the representative of the company that it has established two factories in Queensland and is on the point of establishing one in New South Wales and another in Victoria. If we agree to a higher duty, we shall therefore have the comfort of knowing that we have given a big lift to Nestle's Company. It is coming, into Australia as a manufacturer. </para>

They will not' go an inch higher, because outside competition will prevent them from doing so. </para>

                        <para>- No. The honorable member may indulge in the pleasures of hope; but before his hopes are realized, tens of thousands of infants may die. I would rather see them survive to obtain the benefits of the improvements which, no doubt, it is intended to effect. The statement of the honorable member for Mernda was a gratifying one. The history of the establishment of the milk (preserving industry in Australia is the history of successful industries in all parts of the world, whether they have sprung up under protection or under free-trade. There has always been effort and struggle against prejudice. One of the worst things about the Australian people is that they often harbor an unpatriotic prejudice against local . manufacturers. Whatever one's fiscal policy may be, he has no right 'to have a prejudice of that kind. </para>

                        <para>- He has spoken from information received from actual consumers of the local article, which is entitled to be heard and' weighed. I do not think that "he laid down any absolute rule. He merely gave the statements of persons whose testimony he credits. I was glad to hear the remarks of the honorable member for Mernda. This is an industry which is natural to Australia, and is doing well here. In spite of the tremendous efforts of Nestle's Company, to which the honorable member made reference, twelve other companies have established themselves here, and are increasing their business. Personally, I have no opinion as to the relative merits of the various brands. I merely wish to point out that the former rate was id., and that the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission recommended its' continuance. Of course, their recommendation does not bind us; but in regard to a matter about the facts of which we are not quite clear, a recommendation of staunch protectionists, who examined witnesses at great length, and with much ability, should have weight with us. They recommended that the duties should not be increased on an article which is a necessary in parts of Australia which are the least comfortable to live in, and is often needful for the preservation of infant life. </para>

                    <para>. - The attitude of some manufacturers in regard to this duty is very surprising. In my opinion, the condensed milk made in Australia is equal, and in some cases superior, to the imported article. In the early history of the industry, factories which had turned out an excellent milk occasionally injured its reputation by being unable to keep their output at a high level of quality. Australian preserved milk often went bad, though sometimes imported condensed milk dogs this too. These things do not happen so frequently now. Milk condensed in this country should be superior to milk condensed abroad, and conveyed through the tropics in the warm holds of steamers. Both sections of the Tariff Commission have recommended the continuance of the old rate of duty, and some of the leading local makers have sent circulars to honorable members, intimating that they are satisfied with that rate, and opposed to an increase. </para>

The honorable member for Corio took exception to a letter read by the honorable . member for Grey because it was addressed from Sydney. Apparently he thinks that nothing coming from Sydney should receive attention. The letter which I am about to read was addressed from Melbourne.

                    <para>The output of condensed milk in Australia is steadily increasing, as the difficulties of manufacturers, due to climatic 'conditions, have been surmounted. In the  early  days of the establishment of this industry the progress was slow owing to these influences, and it is due to the fact that it is only recently that scientific research and experiments have overcome these difficulties, that the industry is now forging so rapidly ahead by leaps and bounds. The duty of id. per lb.  compensates  Australian manufacturers for the higher prices they have to pay for labour and for materials used in manufacture, and at the same time enables them to pay a price for milk to farmers, which is more remunerative to them than any other branch of the dairying industry. The request for the increased duty does not come from the manufacturers, who are satisfied and prosperous under the duty of id. per lb. In fact, not one of them submitted evidence before the Tariff Commission on the subject, thus showing that they were completely satisfied with the then existing state of the Tariff. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>That is very strong evidence that they were satisfied with the old rate. The manager of this company interviewed me, and expressed a desire to withdraw his request that the old duty should be retained. He further urged that an increased rate should be imposed. The reasons which he. advanced for his change of front were such as should not influence any honorable member. He abandoned all consideration of what was good for the industry or the people and simply endeavoured to induce me to vote in favour of what would be good for his particular concern. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that that is so. What was the proposal of this gentleman?. He urged that if for a time - owing to the imposition of an excessive duty - Nestle's Company could be shut off from the source of their supplies, and if they were not able to obtain a sufficient supply of local milk - as they would not for some years, until their arrangements had been completed - the continuity of their brand would be destroyed, and his own company would thus be able to get their own brand established in popular favour. That is a nice argument to advance'. Honorable members were practically invited by him to enter into a deliberate conspiracy in favour of one firm. I am sure that some of the milk manufacturers in Australia are too high-minded to adopt an attitude of that sort. If we were to allow a particular brand, which some persons prefer, to be absolutely excluded, in order that we might favour one firm, we should be guilty of a highly improper act. The same gentleman alleged that it would not be to the interests of Australia to allow Nestle's Company to become established here. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. He alleged that it would not be to the interests of Australia to allow the firm to become established here, because it would become a big monopoly, and would eventually secure control of the market, after which it would compel the consumers to pay higher prices. I asked him whether he expected me to swallow such a statement. I said, " If this firm does not establish itself here, and such an enormous duty is levied upon condensed milk, is it not very likely that the manufacturers will combine to take advantage of the premium which is offered to them to increase the price of that article?" </para>

Even in the interests of the condensed milk manufacturers themselves, I doubt whether such high" duties as those proposed are desirable. I think that the evidence is altogether in favour of the suggestion that an impost of id. per lb. is sufficient. </para>

                    <para>. - If there is one industry in the Commonwealth which is performing Australian work, it is the condensed milk industry. If with our enormous dairy herds we cannot produce sufficient milk to supply our own requirements, I do not think that it augurs well for the future. Of course, it has been said that the present supply of milk in the Commonwealth is scarcely sufficient. If that be so, I hold that we should do what we can to stimulate the dairying industry and to enable those who are engaged in it to enjoy a profitable future. Yesterday the honorable member for Corangamite stated that in the western district of Victoria the pig supply had failed simply because the growers could not obtain a sufficiency of skimmed milk. The condensed milk industry and the hog industry are thus seen to be inter-dependent, and the sugar industry might also be included. When the Tariff was under consideration in  1902  it was argued by the opponents of protection that the quality of Australian condensed milk was not equal to that of the imported article. But to-day we have heard not only from the honorable member for Mernda, but from the honorable member for North Svdney, that the secret process connected with the manufacture of this article- ' </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member stated that to-day the Australian manufacturers of condensed milk could turn out a good article, whereas formerly they could not. Consequently, the argument which was advanced in 1902 has no longer any force. As a matter of fact, the locally produced milk is in many cases superior to the imported. The reason is that in almost every State there is a Pure Foods Act in operation, and thus it is almost impossible for any manufacturer of foods to use other than the best ingredients. From the stand-point of the dairyman,  I  wish to point out that whereas the butter factories pay only 3½d. per gallon for milk, the condensed milk factories pay 5½d. per gallon. From the stand-point of the farmer, an industry that will enable him to get 2d. a gallon more for his milk than he could otherwise do is well worth preserving. </para>

I  wish to emphasize the point that it has been shown, beyond the possibility of doubt, that we can produce good preserved milk in Australia; that it is scandalous that we should have imported last year 10,000,000 lbs. of the commodity, and that, by fostering this industry, we shall do a great deal, not merely for the manufacturers, but for the dairymen and farmers throughout the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>.- I  am in favour of an increase of duty. This item relates to what is essentially one of 'the rural industries of Australia. It seems to me that we are always ready to grant an increased duty to any manufacturing industry carried on in our cities, but that when a proposal is made to protect a purely rural industry, the raw material of which is produced in the country, and the whole of the labour associated with it carried out there, there is a stampede on the part of some honorable members. This is an industry which deserves encouragement. The fact that we are annually importing over £200,000 worth of condensed milk, and that the whole of that mill: could be made here if the industry were encouraged, is sufficient to induce me to support the duty. Whilst I favour an increased duty, I would certainly prefer a duty of 1½d. as against British imports and of 2d. per ]b. on imports from other countries, to the duties proposed by the Government. Of £186,000 worth of imports of. this commodity introduced last year, £166,000 worth was the product of countries other than Great Britain, so that it will be recognised that under my proposition we should have a duty of 2d. per lb. practically against the whole world. </para>

                    <para>. - One of the chief considerations that appeal to me in connexion with this item, is the fact that at the present time an enormous quantity of preserved and condensed milk is imported into Australia. The prejudice against Australian products is a matter to which we should pay some attention. Foreign trusts or combines who wish to destroy a local industry never fail to make use of it. Even in the United States of America a foreign trust, which is fighting any local product, invariably resorts to the practice of decrying that local production. The anti- Australia spirit suits the book of the foreign trusts. I think that we ought to be a little more loyal to Australia's productions. I have used Australian preserved milk, and- have found it very good. The honorable member for North Sydney urged that if this duty were agreed to, a local trust could be formed. I agree with him that in connexion with every industry that we may build up, and more particularly in relation to such an industry as this, combines may be created. But I would remind honorable members that the formation of trusts in connexion with all these industries must sound the death knell of private enterprise. The Labour Party ha%'e been asked again and again how far they are prepared to go in the direction of nationalization, and, in reply, I would say that those who wish to see an industry nationalized as quickly as possible, could' not do better than form a combine in connexion with it. In such circumstances, we shall have no hesitation in asking the electors to assist us in making an industry a national co-operative undertaking for the benefit of the people. That being so, we do not fear the establishment of trusts'. The leader of the Opposition made a pathetic appeal to the Committee in regard to infants' foods urging that uniformity in feeding is absolutely essential to the good health of infants. God help the children who have to be reared on condensed milk, since it is a wholesale. mixture. In Nestle's milk, we may have possibly a combination of the milk of thousands of cows as well as of sheep and of goats. </para>

If he were a little more loyal to Australia he would fight for local enterprises. There is no uniformity in condensed milk. Every one knows that it comes from a mixture of the milk of many cows, and I hope that the Committee will not listen to the appeal made by the leader of the Opposition.. It has been said that Nestle's intend to commence operations in Australia. I certainly would not be one to shut out a foreign firm that desired to commence operations here. As soon as a firm from abroad sets up business in Australia, it becomes an Australian enterprise, and has my good wishes. Asa matter of fact, we are imposing this Tariff in order to encourage local competition ; but I think that a fair compromise as between the Government proposal, and the desire of some honorable members, would be to impose a duty of  2d.  per lb. on foreign imports, and of1½d. per lb. on imports from Great Britain.

                    <para>. - I am quite in accord with the proposition submitted by the honorable member for New England. We ought to be particularly careful about increasing the cost of tinned foods of any kind, because they are the main source of supply for miners and other people in the back country, who already have to pay an enhanced price owing to the cost of transport. We, who are more favorably situated, can buy fresh milk, and always prefer it to condensed. It cannot be pleaded that in this industry we have to compete with cheap labour in Europe, seeing that the average cost of keeping a cow in Australia is about  £2  per annum, whereas the average cost in countries, with which we enter into competition, is£5, and. at times reaches  £12  per head. It will be seen, therefore, that milk can be produced more . cheaply in Australia than in any other part of the world, except, perhaps, Argentina. The honorable member for West Sydney suggested a duty of1½d. per lb. all round, and I asked him what such a duty would amount to on whole milk. Jt is only fair, if we desire to give protection to this rural industry that we should know to what extent the milk producer will benefit by the protection. One gallon of whole milk will produce  3  lbs. of concentrated milk for the purpose of making condensed milk; and if we add  40  per cent, of sugar we have, when the process . is completed, say,  4  lbs. of condensed milk to one gallon of whole milk. Therefore, a duty of1½d. per lb. is equal to about  6d.  per gallon ; and  6d.  per gallon, I may say, is considered a very good price for- milk in many parts of Australia. I speak with some interest in this matter, seeing that there are four condensed milk factories in the Moreton constituency. I was sorry to hear some remarks as to the inferiority of the Australian commodity, particularly in view of the fact that those engaged in the industry in the Moreton district cannot supply the demand. If an order were given to-day  for a. case of condensed milk at the Cressbrook or Standard factories, it could not be fulfilled,  because  orders are booked up for some considerable time, and I think that a similar state of affairs prevails in the whole of the factories of the Commonwealth.  Some time ago it was found impossible to place the product of the Shoalhaven factory in the market. </para>

                        <para>- The Bacchus Marsh Company took up the factory ; and since then there has been no trouble whatever. We can produce as good condensed milk in Australia as in any part of the world ; and I am surprised to hear that some of our confectionery manufacturers prefer Nestle's milk. It has been urged by some who are interested in increasing this duty, that, for condensed milk a special kind of milk and a special kind of cow are required ; but that is all " tommy-rot." There is no branch of the dairying industry in. which tainted milk can be used to better advantage; and when I say " tainted " I do not mean impure milk. Those engaged in the industry know that sometimes the pastures taint the milk, but all the taint is removed by evaporation and pasteurization, and the milk can be turned into the condensed article without any fear of deleterious results. So far as the farmers are concerned, they are quite satisfied with a duty of i|d". per lb. </para>

                    <para>Do you think any standard should be fixed with regard to the composition of that? - I have examined 'some specimens of condensed milk containing, very little more fat than is in  uncondensed milk.  I certainly think that the quantity of fat which should be eliminated from milk before it is condensed ought to be determined. I think some samples of condensed milk that I have examined are monstrous ; it is very difficult to get convictions, though. </para>
                    <para>Have you examined any samples of condensed milk from abroad, or have all the condensed milks you have examined been manufactured in Ireland ? - Some we obtained from other sources-they were hot all Limerick and Cork condensed 'milks ; some were foreign. I have not very recently examined any. </para>

                    <para>Can you give any information with respect to condensed milk? - . . . There is one of the best-known condensed milks, the makers of which say on the labels that for the purpose of feeding children it should be diluted with from twelve to fourteen parts of water. Now, seeing that it never was concentrated more than three, down to one - not twelve or fourteen down to one - it means that the children who are served with that milk diluted to that extent, in accordance, with the directions of the manufacturers, are starved. </para>

                    <para>Would you kindly tell the Committee something about that Association? - That Association was started with a view of enlightening the public as to the exact value of machine-skimmed condensed milk. The members of the Condensed Milk Association are practically all the manufacturers of machine-skimmed condensed milk. Some of us manufacture whole cream condensed milk, but the bulk of it is machine-skimmed milk. (The  Chairman).  - In Europe? - Yes. </para>
                    <para>That would be Holland, Germany, and Ireland ? - Yes. </para>
                    <para>Those three countries? - Yes. Italy manufactures a small quantity of machine-skimmed condensed milk, but it is practically insignificant. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">Honorable members have challenged the statement that there is machine-skimmed condensed milk in use, but the evidence which I have read shows that in Great Britain there is an association for the defence of manufacturers of machine-skimmed condensed milk. Is it a fair thing to put such a production on the markets of the world, especially for use by infants ? Honorable members know that cream separators extract from the milk every vestige of the butter fat, so that milk skimmed by them is absolutely valueless as a food. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member knows the brands that are on this market I am not here to destroy or libel any industry; my object is to protect Australian industries. As they have been attacked-; I am showing the sort of competition to which they are subjected. I should welcome the opening of a Nestle's factory here, because Parliament can control all the manufacturing done in Australia. I understand that the company is losing its import trade, supplying now only 50 per cent., whereas formerly it supplied 75 per cent. ; but I do not understand honorable members who desire that manufacturing shall be done at the other end of the world rather than in Australia. If they have so much at heart the interests of the importers that they would like them to capture the Australian trade, why do they not go to Switzerland and France, and take up their residence there? We are pleased to see manufacturers establish themselves here, and welcome their competition, because it is beneficial to the consumers; whose interests I am as desirous to serve as is any other honorable member. </para>

Last week I bought a tin of each for the purposes of comparison, and found the imported milk thicker than the Australian milk, and possessing a cloudiness and strong flavour which is .absent from the latter. </para>

                        <para>-When the staunch protectionists in the Labour corner wished to make a presentation to the retiring leader of the party, the other night, they selected an imported article, and when I went to supper this morning, after having helped the Government to do business until long past midnight, the first thing that was poked under my nose was a bottle of imported pickles. If one goes where protectionists habitually resort, one finds that they use chiefly imported articles. As I have said, the Australian condensed milk seems to me better than the imported. The latter may keep a little longer, but the thickening of which I have spoken is, to my mind, a disadvantage, and a sign of deterioration. Still, an industry which is native to the soil, which has got over its initial difficulties, and is now producing a good article, ought to be able to stand, even if protected by the duty which is proposed by the honorable member for. Grey. I shall support a duty of i£d. on the general Tariff, and id. on the Tariff affecting the United Kingdom. </para>

                    <para>.- In view of the statements which have been made during the debate, I do not think that the Committee will regard the proposition as a generous one, or enthusiastically welcome it. The rate proposed in the first Tariff was 1½d., but Parliament reduced it to id., because that was something above the average rates of the States. It was stated at the time that a duty of 1½d. would be equivalent to 35 or 40 per cent, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> on the imported value of condensed milk, so that, assuming that values are about the same now, the rate now suggested is something like 50 per cent, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem. Prior to</inline> Federation the Victorian and Queensland rates were 2d.-; the South Australian rate,' id. ; the Tasmanian rate, 20 per cent; and the Western Australian rate, 15 per cent. ; while there was no duty in New South Wales. The average of these rates was less than id. Under the circumstances, I think we might, well make the rates i£d. and id. I was influenced in the decision to which' I came on the Kingston proposal, and will be influenced in this instance, not by pressure brought from outside, but by' the facts I have stated. On this occasion the - pressure brought to bear upon me has come rather from the local manufacturers than from importers. All the State Tariffs, with the exception of that of New South Wales, used to combine the principles of revenue and protection. I believe that a duty of i£d. per lb. upon condensed milk is equivalent to a protection of 35 or 40 per cent. Without urging that the locally produced article is not so good as the imported, I am sure that honorable members will recognise that the more worldwide the competition to which our manufactures are subjected in- respect of their quality, the better will be the guarantee to the consumer of their excellence. </para>

                    <para>. - I fail to understand why the Treasurer has departed from the recommendation of the Tariff Commission in regard to condensed milk. Both sections of that body were unanimous in recommending the imposition of a duty of id. per lb. upon this article, which was the old rate. As one who has travelled in the back portions of Queensland and Western Australia, I think that such an impost is quite sufficient. In the locality which I shall be visiting next January I shall be very lucky if I can purchase a tin of  Nestle's  milk for less than 3s. The persons who use condensed milk largely in Australia are the working miners and the residents of the interior. I ask honorable members where there are better pastures than those to be found in Australia? What, are the pastures in Switzerland and Denmark - from which' Nestle's. milk comes - as compared with our own? The dairy stock in those countries has to be housed for six or seven months in the year, whereas our stock  is  rarely housed. Indeed our dairy cows are rarely fed except when they are about to be milked. With all these conditions in our favour I say that if we cannot manufacture condensed milk cheaper than can the countries which I have indicated, we ought to be able to do so, especially in view of the natural protection which the industry enjoys. I favour the proposal of the honorable member for Grey to levy a duty of 1½d. per lb. upon condensed milk of foreign origin, and of id. per lb. upon the product of Great Britain. If that is not a sufficient measure of protection to extend to the industry it ought to be. In this connexion, we must recollect that the more we are subjected to competition the  more likely are we to improve our own productions. It is competition which will enable us to manufacture condensed milk of better quality than that of the imported article. I have tried most of the brands of Australian preserved milk, and I admit that they are very excellent. But some will not keep as well as does the imported milk. I have purchased cases of the locally produced article, the contents of which have been blown. Either it had not been concentrated sufficiently, or the defect was due to some secret in the process of manufacture which we have not yet mastered. That happened to me only last June. The milk arrived in the condition which I described from the merchant in Perth. We have to view this matter from various standpoints. We have to recollect that as yet we are not a self-contained people. But even if we were we should naturally desire to have everything of the best. Surely we ought not to tax this article to any greater extent, seeing that it already enjoys a natural protection of 50 per cent. The more I look into the question the more I see that there is no justification for the proposed increase. It is not the residents of the large centres who use concentrated milk, but the working miner and the man in the bush. Away back in Queensland - in the Maranoa district - the sheep-owners and cattle-raisers' use nothing but concentrated milk all the year round. In Western Australia, too, one can see loads of concentrated milk being carted to the interior for the miners by means of waggons, donkeys, mules, and camels. Personally, I should like to see both concentrated milk and butter manufactured in the country where the raw materials of which they are composed are produced. If the Treasurer, will consent to make the duty 1½d. per lb. against the outside world, and id. per lb. against the products of Great Britain, I shall support him. </para>

                        <para>- I  have seen bad imported tin fish, and I have also drunk Australian wine which ' nearly poisoned me. But because of these things, I am not prepared to say that all imported tinned fish is bad, -or that all Australian wine is bad. In the same way,  I  hold that all Australian condensed milk is not of the same quality as that to which the honorable member referred. I wish to point out to the honorable member for Swan that whilst the Anglo-Swiss Company were supplying "Melbourne with condensed milk at from 27s. to 29s. 6d. per case, its price in Fremantle was 31s. 3d. per case. This difference in price was due to the fact that there was competition in Melbourne, whereas in Fremantle there was none. If we have local competition, the imported article will be sold here for less than it would be otherwise.' Of course,  I  am aware that a number of our manufacturers have declared that they do not wish to see the old rate of duty increased. But many of them have since expressed their sorrow for having made that statement. The principal reason why they did not desire an increase of the duty was that they recognised that the result of its operation would be to subject them to more competition. All the talk about conserving the interests of the residents of the back-blocks is so much moonshine. I advocate the local production of all commodities that can be manufactured in Australia.  Prices will be kept at a normal level by local competition. I have only to say in conclusion that an increase in local production has tended, and always will tend, to decrease prices. </para>

It has been asserted by more than one honorable member that I am decrying Australian industries and productions. Nothing is further from my thoughts. I venture to say that not one of those who have attacked me have made greater sacrifices on behalf of their country than I have done, and that  no meaner device 'could be resorted to in order to injure a man politically than" is that of deliberately misinterpreting his statements.  I  simply said this morning that it is a peculiar fact - and if it be a fact nothing will induce me to change my, opinion with regard to it - that Nestlé's milk, after the tin has been opened, keeps better than does any other brand. Men who have used_ it in Western Australia as well as in other places, have so informed me. The reason for this  I'  cannot tell. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know whether that is so or not. It may be because the cows from which the milk is obtained are groomed, stalled, and' hand-fed during the winter months, or it may be due to climatic conditions. Some preserved milk made in New Zealand is said to be very good, and to keep better than does milk made in warmer climates. If that be so, surely it cannot be said that in mentioning the fact I am decrying an Australian industry. Here is the evidence of a witness who was examined before the Tariff Commission - </para>

I know of a man whose inf ant was supplied with milk from a cow that subsequently died from tubercle, and soon after the child died from the same complaint. In a herd of cattle there may be one or two cranky cows, and is it not much better that a child should be fed on a mixture of twenty cows' milk than on the milk of a cranky one? The honorable member for New England said that even goats' milk might sometimes be used in a preparation of condensed milk. As a matter of fact such a thing as tubercle in goats' milk has never been known. I have no desire to detain the Committee, but I felt it necessary to vindicate the position I have taken up. </para>

                    <para>. - In view of the statement made, by the honorable member for Hunter, I think that I ought to say a word or two on behalf of the Cressbrook Milk Factory. The honorable member has said that condensed milk cannot be made anywhere outside of Great Britain. </para>

I do not hold a brief for the Cressbrook Milk Factory. </para>
