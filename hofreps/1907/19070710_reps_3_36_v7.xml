                        <para>- I wish to ask the honorable gentleman a question in regard to the matter which I brought before the House last night. In the conditions of contract; signed by the then Postmaster-General, the honorable member for Coolgardie, dated 7th July, and published in the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Gazette</inline> of the 9th July, 1904, it is expressly required that tenderers shall state the nature of the refrigerating accommodation which they are prepared to provide, and penalties are arranged for in the event of the breach of any of the conditions relating to the provision of refrigerating accommodation. I ask the honorable gentleman why the present conditions are less liberal and less favorable to the producers of Australia than those sought to be imposed by the Postmaster-General of the Labour Administration. </para>

On the contrary, I said that I am desirous of having it printed here, but that a communication had been received from England asking whether additional copies shall be printed there, and stating the price for doing the work. That communication reached us this morning, or yesterday. No member of this Government desires that the printing should be done in England. The right honorable member is more likely to favour a proposal of that kind than are the members of this Administration. </para>

I do not suppose it is necessary at this stage to say that the State of New South Wales has a very strong desire that this question of the establishment within her territory of the .Federal Capital shall be brought to an early determination. </para>

Of course, sir, I withdraw that remark, but the honorable member who interjected is absolutely aware of certain steps which I took during the last Parliament in this connexion. He knows as well as does any honorable member that it was not my fault the question was not settled during that Parliament, and it is idle for him to pretend that he does not know. </para>

                            <para>- In New South Wales there exists a very strong feeling indeed that this matter should be finally determined as soon as possible. While there is a difference of opinion in that State as to where the Seat of Government should be located, the consensus of opinion is that the particular site which has so far received the approval of a majority of members of this Parliament is not one which is acceptable to the people in New South Wales. I do not say for a moment that statements to the effect that this Parliament was influenced by ulterior motives in the selection of that site have received any great credence in New South Wales. I do not think that the people of that State attribute to honorable members of this or the last Parliament any ulterior motives or <inline font-style="italic">mala fide</inline> intentions in the selection of </para>

                    <para class="block">Dalgety. But there is a feeling that the choice of that site does not do justice to New South Wales, and that in consequence of an agreement about which we have heard a good deal of late, an effort should be made to secure a site within a more reasonable- distance .of the centres of population in that State. Speaking personally, I think that an endeavour should be made to obtain a site which will fulfil all the requisite conditions for the Seat of Government of Australia much better than does Dalgety. I merely wish to say one word in regard to the general aspect of things. I absolutely fail to sympathize with those who believe that the establishment of a bush capital is not justified, and that we should hold the sittings of the Commonwealth Parliament in one or other of the big centres of population - at any rate for a considerable time to come. I wish to urge upon those who entertain that view* that, in my judgment, so long as the Commonwealth Parliament sits in one or other of these two great centres, so long will the legislation which it enacts be viewed with jaundiced eyes by the people of the other capital. There is a very grave danger indeed of friction arising, as it almost inevitably must, from the mere location in one centre or the other of one&#39;s interests and home, and this will be largely minimized if we get into neutral territory, and our legislation is studied upon its merits. That being so, I urge that no consideration of pounds, shillings, and pence should be allowed to weigh with honorable members as against broad national interests. Whether we remain in Melbourne or go to Sydney, or whether we establish a fresh capital upon prairie land, in my opinion the cost to the Commonwealth will not appreciably differ. I think I could conclusively demonstrate that fact, but I have not time to deal with that aspect of the matter to-day. My chief <inline font-style="italic">reason</inline> for moving the adjournment of the House is to draw attention first to the fact that the Treasurer has thought it necessary to assume the championship of one particular site. I do not object to the right honorable gentleman expressing his opinion upon the floor of the House, as other honorable members do, in respect to the claims of different portions of New South Wales, but I say that any report which he has to make upon this subject should be made to his colleagues. It is not a matter upon which practically a State paper should emanate from the Treasurer in favour of this or that particular site. </para>

I am informed that some members of the parliamentary party were driven out on a Sunday afternoon to inspect a portion of the Canberra site. I recollect the Attorney-General informing me in the train the .next morning that the site was a very pretty one. Had I seen it at the time I should never have voted for any other site. Unfortunately it was only about twelve months ago that I saw it, and was converted. I wish now to point to certain remarks of the Treasurer which are contained in his report, and which seem to me to call for comment. The first matter to which I would direct attention is his statement in connexion with the facilities for obtaining a water supply at Canberra. He says - </para>

                            <para>- They have evidence that the river has never been known to fail. Perhaps it would induce a more consecutive effort on my part if I were allowed to proceed on my own lines. I repeat, upon the authority of two of the best engineers in New South Wales, that the Cotter River alone is sufficient to supply the requirements of a city possessing a population of 250,000. An exactly similar catchment, though of larger extent, is to be found on the Gudgenby River. It has a capacity equal to that of the Cotter, and further a- field is the Queanbeyan River - the original supply proposed to be tapped for the Lake George site. There is also the Goodradigbee River. </para>

Further, the Treasurer is aware that it is quite a common thing to convey water a considerable distance to supply the wants of a city, but in this instance he has over-stated the distance which it would require to be brought. He has declared that a water supply for Canberra would need to be conveyed a distance of thirty miles, whereas the engineers say that it will only require to be brought a distance of twenty-five miles. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that it would cost nearly as much. In my view it would be more economical - if Dalgety were finally decided upon as the site for the Seat of Government - to obtain a pumping supply for that place. These circumstances show that the Treasurer has put the position of Canberra in an altogether unfavorable light as compared with Dalgety. The Treasurer goes on to speak of its accessibility from Melbourne and Sydney, and finding that the figures so far as existing railways are concerned are against him, since they show that Canberra is infinitely more accessible than is Dalgety from either Sydney or Melbourne, he refers to the possibilities of the future. We know what an optimist the right honorable gentleman is, and he seems to regard the projected railway from Bairnsdale to Cooma as being practically already constructed. According to the lowest estimate, an expenditure of over &#163;1,500,000 would be necessary on the construction of the line, but that is a mere bagatelle to the Treasurer. Although he has to admit that Canberra is now more accessible - by nearly 100 miles - than is Dalgety from either Melbourne or Sydney, he proceeds to state that when the railway from Bairnsdale to Cooma is constructed, Dalgety will be equi-distant from the two State capitals, and that the prospect will then be brilliant and glowing. We are told by him that in the matter of power supply Canberra is distinctly inferior to Dalgety. I am prepared to admit that in this respect there are greater possibilities attaching to Dalgety, but from the right honorable gentleman&#39;s report one would imagine that Canberra has no possibilities in this regard. What are the facts? Within 36 miles of the Canberra site, one of the greatest reservoirs in the world - the Barren Jack - is now in course of construction, and it is estimated by the engineers who have charge of the work that many thousands of horsepower will be perpetually running to waste there unless some means are devised to take advantage of it. </para>

A lot of the water would be used in connexion with irrigation, but provision for power schemes has already been made. Apart from this, however, I would point out that  9  miles below Canberra there is, on the Murrumbidgee at this point, a splendid site for a weir which, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Weedon,</inline> could be built sufficiently high to enable power to be developed for electric lighting and other purposes. The Commissioners made careful inquiries in regard to the flow of the Murrumbidgee in connexion with the proposed selection of Lake George as the site of the Federal Capital, and they reported that the flow at this point was equal to  69,600.000,006  gallons, or  307!  millions of tons of water per annum.

                            <para>- Under the heading of &#34; Water frontage for recreation, sport, and beauty - good approach and commanding view,&#34; the Treasurer states that Canberra is distinctly inferior to Dalgety- I am, perhaps, a poor judge of scenic effect, but I have no hesitation in saying that Canberra in this respect is infinitely superior to Dalgety. The Treasurer has done Canberra a serious injustice, because while he speaks of the hills in the vicinity being only  700  feet above the general level, he fails altogether to mention the most important fact that immediately behind the site, and visible from nearly every part of it, are the Murrumbidgee mountains, which rise thousands of feet above the general level, forming the most effective and striking background that I have seen in New South Wales. </para>

                        <para>In general suitability for the purposes of a Federal Capital City site, Canberra compares most favorably with any site yet suggested. The extent of gently undulating country suitable for building exceeds that of any of those other sites, while the low hills generally surrounding the city area, with the foot hills in the middle distance to the south, and the high peaks again in the far distance, forming the mountains of the southern watershed of the Murrumbidgee, give it an attraction as regards scenery unsurpassed by the others suggested. </para>

When I mentioned the magnificent background which the Murrumbidgee mountains offer to the Canberra site he promptly objected that  they  were 20 miles away, but in writing of Dalgety he mentions Mount Kosciusko as a background for that site although it is 40, not 20, miles distant. </para>

                            <para>- I have seen the summit of Mount Kosciusko without snow, although it sometimes remains there very late in the season. On the Murrumbidgee mountains the snow does not remain as late. The right honorable gentleman says that there is a great similarity between the fertility of the soil of Canberra and that of Dalgety. As one who, for a good many years, has taken a great interest in soils and in land questions generally, I do not hesitate to say that there is no possible comparison between the two. In the opinion of nearly every expert whom I have met, the soil immediately around Dalgety is poor. </para>

The plains of undulating country which lie beyond now present, and usually present, one of the finest sights, as a piece of country, that any person could find in New South Wales. For that reason st seems to  &#34; me that the Treasurer, probably with the best intentions in the world, has clone a serious injustice to the site which I have been advocating. </para>

                        <para>.- May I, as one who has not spoken on any specific motion relating to the Capital Site, draw honorable members&#39; attention to what I consider to be the expediency of having an amendment of the Constitution,, so as to eliminate the condition as. to the 100 miles limit from Sydney. I am sure that honorable members will, at all events, give me permission to draw their attention to the alleged expediency of such a change; and I shall say what I have to say as shortly as possible, and endeavour to support it by a reference in an article which appeared in the English press just before the adoption of the Constitution. We all remember the circumstances under which the limit of 100 miles was fixed as the nearest point to which the Federal Capital could be brought to the metropolis of New South Wales. That condition was made, I think, without much reason. It was decided at the Premiers&#39; Conference that the Federal Capital should be in New South Wales, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner, in order fo prevent the possibility of its being fixed in Sydney, moved that the limit of 100 miles should be stipulated. I never agreed with that condition, which I thought &#39;to be made without tiny other consideration than that arising from the jealousy there was at the time on the part of Victoria of the possibility of New South Wales having the capital. In this matter we, as a Commonwealth, have adopted the precedent set us by America. When this question was under consideration here in 1901, on the occasion of the Centennial Celebrations, there was almost a universal chorus of denunciation of Washington as the Seat of Government. It was pointed out that society there was largely composed of civil servants, politicians, and third-rate pressmen, with the addition of a large body of professional touts who were paid large salaries to importune members in favour of particular interests. It was also pointed out that almost every one of the special capitals created in the States of America, which had followed the example of the Federal Government, had been found to be a failure. The Seat of the United States Government was changed to Washington in i8o.r, and for thirty or forty years regularly, every year, there was a motion in </para>

                    <para>Congress in favour of members going back to some centre of population where an atmosphere, not altogether political, might be breathed by honorable members. The fact is that the compromise in regard to Washington was adopted, because some of the southern States had declined to join the Union. It was pointed out, when Hamilton asked that the southern States should consent to the debts incurred during the civil war being paid by the States per head of population, that some of the States had no debts, and that it would be inequitable to adopt his scheme. Then, on the occasion of the second great debate in 1789, Hamilton promised that if the southern States consented to his adjustment in regard to the debts, he would secure, or endeavour to secure, that the Federal Capital should be at some site on the Potomac, thus placing on record the first instance of log-rolling on any great public question. I shall not put the matter in my own words, but call the attention of honorable members to an article which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Saturday Review,</inline> of 1.9th May, 1900, just before the Commonwealth Constitution was finally adopted. I do not say that the article is perfectly accurate in its forecast as to what would occur under Federation, because it predicted that through the unification of the States there would at once be a unification of the debts and a saving of at least 1 per cent, in the interest, and we know the value of that conjecture. This is the reference to the Federal Capital - </para>

                        <para>The man must be fastidious indeed in his ambition who cannot find satisfaction in shaping the destinies of a &#34;continent. If the wider opportunities now offered to intellect and energy should draw into politics a class which has hitherto stood aloof, this Bill will have conferred no less a boon on the Empire than on Australia. For undoubtedly the degeneration which threatens, or has befallen, all democratic Governments to-day results from the absorption of power by the political machine and its manipulators. For this reason we regret that mutual jealousies have prevented the colonies from fixing on Sydney or Melbourne as the capital _pf the Federation. Such self-abnegation is perhaps more than could reasonably have been expected from colonial1 human nature, and yet it was so obviously the best thing to do for the future of the continent that we could almost have hoped that patriotism might have sufficiently stimulated magnanimity. As it is, the result must inevitably be that some obscure and inoffensive township which arouses no jealousies, but which awakes no enthusiasm, will become the seat of Government. It will1 probably exist for and by politicians only, and accordingly can hardly have many charms as a place of residence. We greatly fear that what is gained in the magnitude of the political issues will be lost to some extent in the locality where the game is played. In the United States, both Federal politics and those of individual States suffer from the fact that they have to be carried on as a rule in towns which have only come into existence <inline font-style="italic">ad hoc,</inline> and have no other claim to recognition either as centres of intellectual, social, or business life. How much of the interest taken by the best class of minds in this country in politics would evaporate if the political centre were to be transferred from London to some obscure provincial town ! It may be hoped that common sense may in time cause Australian political activity to gravitate towards some acknowledged centre of national life. </para>

                    <para class="block">Here is a point of view which honorable members ought to remember before they decide to establish the Seat of Government in some place sequestered from the healthy play of public opinion that is not purely political. It does us members good sometimes to come into intercourse with men not merely political, but who bring to bear commercial, financial, and social views generally, which we are not accustomed in this House to often hear brought to bear on the formation of opinions by honorable members. </para>

                        <para>. - I hardly desire to embark on this discussion at the present time. I may say, however, that although I have reported to the Government on almost all the sites that were recommended- by the Commissioners who examined them on behalf of the Commonwealth Government, I have never done so on my own motion. I happened to be Minister of Home Affairs when the sites were first reported on by the Commissioners, and it was my duty to visit the sites, and express an opinion for the information of my colleagues, that information being placed before honorable members afterwards. I do not know that any honorable member is under an obligation to take notice of any opinion I express on the Federal Capital Sites, because my reports contain nothing more than an expression of individual opinion, and I do not desire that they should. I have had some professional knowledge and experience which may qualify me to express an opinion on a matter of the sort, but that is by the way. I do not desire honorable members, or the people of the country, to be guided by any opinion of mine unless it commends itself to them. In regard to the present aspect of the matter, I was specially asked by the Premier of New South Wales to visit Canberra and report upon the site. I declined at first, because I thought that I ought not to undertake the task in view of my position in the Government, and the fact that the Federal Parliament had already expressed their opinion, behind which I thought I ought not to go. </para>

                                asked me to visit Canberra, and I presume intended that I should report upon it, otherwise my visit would have no object. If I take the trouble to inspect, am I not to give the people of the country and the Parliament the advantage of any information I have?

                            <para>- I was there one day, which is quite as long a time as was spent on other sites by honorable members, who now express themselves freely in regard to these questions, although in most cases they have no professional knowledge. I do not desire the leader of the Opposition to take any notice, of my views and opinions unless they commend themselves to him. I come from the far west of Australia, and no one would suggest for a moment that I have any personal interest in any of these sites. I do not suppose it is very likely that I shall ever sit in the Legislature when the seat of Government is in the new Capital - the chances are against that being  the case. It will be seen, therefore, that I have not what is vulgarly called &#34; any axe to grind.&#34; I am in this matter not the representative of the Government, but merely a private citizen. I am not going to advise in any other than a just way, not even to please the honorable member for&#34; East Sydney or the leader of the Labour Party. I cannot help it if the site in question does not commend itself to me as much as it does to some other honorable members. What is the honorable member for South Sydney driving at? If my report had been according to his way of thinking would he have said anything? Because I cannot make my views to his order, he would seem to think that I have some ulterior motive. </para>

                            <para>- I am not referring to the exploration of Perth, but to the Treasurer&#39;s magnificent exploits when exploring the desert country in the heart of Australia, which I hold to be worthy of the highest admiration, and such as will keep him in memory as one of the great figures in- Australian  history.  Whilst I do not admire my right honorable friend from the literary point of view, I admire his achievements- as, an explorer. Had the Premier of New South Wales known how far the Treasurer had committed himself to Dalgety, he would not have asked him to visit Canberra, because once the right honorable gentleman has formed an opinion, and expressed it two or three times,, no power on earth can cause him to alter it. He needs a little of my flexibility. For some time past the honorable member for South Sydney and myself have been in thorough accord in regard to the Federal Capital question, and he moved this adjournment motion with my full concurrence. I preferred that he should do so in order that not the slightest savour of party feeling should be imported into the debate. I thought it better that the leader of the Labour Party, who for the last twelve months has taken great interest in this matter, should bring it before the- House than that there should- be any ground for the suggestion that it was being brought forward as a party move by the Opposition. On the question of expense, I wish to say that the fixing of the Federal Capital should not involve any enormous outlay. The matter will be within our control, and not one penny can be spent without our full approval. There are two ways of beginning the founding of a capital. One is a most extravagant way, which would be utterly unjustifiable, while the other is moderate and prudent. The main point to which I direct attention is this : The Convention decided that the Federal Capital should not be placed in a great city. That was the reason for the special provision relating to the territory for the Seat, of Government. Much as I should like to see the Capital placed in Sydney&#39;, I know that the people of New South Wales could not be asked to give such valuable land for nothing. The people of Melbourne would not deal in that way with their property, because they are sensible men. Would it not be a gross injustice to Victoria if the Commonwealth were to take over the magnificent block of buildings in which we meet without honestly paying the State for it ? The arrangement was entered into by the then Premiers of the six States of Australia, and embodied in a formal minute, that the capital should be in New South Wales, and, on the faith of it, I engaged to put a Bill through the New South Wales Parliament providing for a second referendum. I fulfilled my part of the contract, putting the Bill through, and .loyally advocating the acceptance of the draft Constitution as amended. I do not make an idle appeal to honorable men when I ask this House to show a desire to fulfil the obligation, but for which Federation would not have come into existence. </para>

                        <para>It is considered that the fixing of the site of Capital is a question which might well be left to the Parliament to decide; but in view of the strong expression of opinion in relation to this matter in New South Wales, the Premiers have modified the clause, so that while the Capital cannot be fixed at Sydney, or in its neighbourhood, provision is made in the Constitution for its establishment in New South Wales at a reasonable distance from that city. </para>

                            <para>- That is a matter of opinion. I do not presume to dictate to any honorable member on this subject, but, as a representative of New South Wales, I am perhaps better able to judge of the feeling of the people of that State than are the representatives of other States, and I believe that I faithfully express it when I say that the people of New South Wales do not regard the selection of Dalgety as a compliance with the understanding. They would, however, regard the selection of Canberra as an honorable and fair discharge of the obligation entered into on behalf of the Federation by the six Premiers. It was absurd for the Treasurer to attempt to decide the claims of Canberra by one day&#39;s visit to the site, and to condemn it after so short an inspection. -I r, I&#93;--: have not time now to deal at length with the reports of the engineers who have examined the place, but I draw the attention of honorable members to the following passage from a report by the Chief Engineer for New South Wales : - </para>

Of course, the House cannot deal with this measure now, and I have referred to these details only by way of providing a counterpoise to the unfavorable minute of the Treasurer. I hope, however, that the whole question will be settled with as little delay as possible. 1 have already admitted that much of the delay which has occurred has not been the fault of the House, and .has been due to circumstances which I have detailed; but I hope honorable members will brush aside the struggle of the Montagues and the  Capulets  between the advocates of Bombala, Dalgety., Tooma, and Albury.

They do not like the Government, and they do not like the Opposition any better, and therefore they keep the milk in che cocoanuts. The only request I make to honorable members at the present time is that they will take this matter into their serious and early consideration, bearing in mind the terms of the understanding between the Premiers, in virtue of which I carried through the New South Wales Parliament a Bill enabling the second referendum to take place. I do not ask the House just now for its judgment upon Canberra, or any other site, but I do ask the Government to bring the matter before us as soon as possible. </para>

                    <para>M!r. MALONEY. - I wish to see a great experiment tried in connexion with a different form of land tenure from that with which we are most familiar. We have the advantage of the experience of the United States in connexion with the selection of its capital, and we know that if they had the opportunity the States forming that union would to-day approve of the land surrounding the Seat of Government being nationalized instead of being alienated in fee simple. Seventy years ago Washington was seen in imagination by one artistic man who was not appreciated in his day by the Americans, and who died of a broken heart. But those who have seen that magnificent city can appreciate the idea which he had in his mind when he designed it. Let us in Australia benefit by American experience, just as we have benefited in the freedom of our laws by the example which was set by the youngest daughter of the motherland when she separated from her on account of injustice. Had it not been for the action of America our laws would not be as free as they are to-day. Let us build a city which will be a glory to our race. If the people of the Commonwealth desire to have a voice in the selection of the Seat of Government, why not secure the passing of a law which will empower the Commonwealth to purchase even the city of Sydney if it chooses to do so, upon the valuation of the property owners themselves? </para>

                            <para>- The leader of the Opposition has sufficient common sense to recognise that there is more in my statement than he has &#34;given me credit for. I said why not empower the Commonwealth to purchase even the city of Sydney upon the valuation of the property owners themselves - the valuation upon which they are willing to pay rates and taxes. At first sight, my proposal might appear unjust to the State. But I am sure that the right honorable member, with his legal training, will agree that if a property owner is going to be taxed upon his valuation, he will make a fair valuation,, and not an absurd one. Under those circumstances the State would not be robbed, as Victoria is being robbed to-day, and has been robbed in the past. But &#34; a plague on both your houses.&#34; Let us settle this matter quickly, and .get to work and build a city of which Australia will be proud. </para>

Upon what ground does he make that appeal? Upon the strength of a piece of paper which he has discovered, and of which the people of Australia knew nothing whatever until after Dalgety had been selected by this Parliament- </para>

I am content to remark that it is a singular circumstance that most of those honorable members who have inspected Dalgety support its selection, whereas many of those who chide the Treasurer - who by the way is eminently fitted to express an opinion upon its merits - with having remained at Canberra only a day, have never seen it, and some honorable members who condemn Dalgety have never paid a visit there. They talk about the right of New South Wales to dictate to the Commonwealth. Surely we are old enough to realize that Sydney does not constitute New South Wales, and that New South Wales does not constitute Australia. The honorable member for South Sydney, however, despite all his cleverness, will not draw me off the track, and thus prevent me from quoting what he said in this connexion when he was Prime Minister. He declared - </para>

                            <para>- Those honorable members who are in favour of Dalgety do not care what New South Wales may da in this House, because she has already done her best. In the first Parliament, there were thirty-two representatives from New South Wales, thirty-one of whom voted against the selection of a site in the Eden-Monaro district, and only one in favour of it. They displayed a remarkable unanimity, and one has to be very generous to believe that it was the result of solid conviction, and not of dictation, by the Sydney press. In my opinion, an alteration of the Constitution (will be required before we can substitute any other site for that which we have already chosen. I am quite prepared to* meet the opponents of Dalgety at any time, What is the use of making frantic appeals which are based upon sympathy and pieces of paper that Ave have never seen - appeals by a gentleman who has previously, declared that this matter had been definitely settled ? I believe that the members of this Parliament are determined that New South Wales shall not be permitted to dictate to it in this connexion. Are we going to say that we will be content to substitute an inferior site for Dalgety simply because it is closer to Sydney? What does it matter to us whether it is closer to Sydney or not? We want to choose the best site for all Australia. This is an Australian matter- </para>

Similarly, Canberra is a very good site, but I maintain that in the opinion of honorable members who are prepared to judge impartially, it is not to be compared with Dalgety. What I fear is that if once this question be re-opened, as nearly every honorable member who has visited Tooma voted for it, and if any change is made, the result would probably be that the Tooma site would be chosen.&#34; I am opposed to the selection of Tooma, and consequently against any. effort being made by honorable members to re-open the question.

                            <para>- I have no desire at this stage to discuss the relative merits of the several suggested sites. I. simply point out that the Premier of New South Wales, urged on by some one - and we find the leader of the Opposition and the leader of the Labour Party in perfect accord as to the desirableness of Canberra - requested the Treasurer to inspect the Canberra site. The right honorable gentleman did so, but could not make a report to order, and now that he has set forth in cold type his honest conviction that Canberra is not a suitable or satisfactory site for the Capital, he is bitterly denounced. This is not a party question, and I suppose that the Minister of Trade and Customs does not indorse all that the leader of the Labour Party has said. All that I ask on behalf of Dalgety is fair play. It has been chosen as the site of the Capital, and although the most desperate efforts have been made to induce honorable members to reconsider their decision, not one of those who voted for that site has, to my knowledge, made a move in opposition to it. The people of Monaro scorn these attempts to secure Tooma as the site of the Capital, and I warn the leader of the Opposition that in backing up those who are seeking to reopen this question, if ever the Seat of Government Act is ripped up, and Dalgety struck out, Tooma will probably be selected, and the settlement of the question still longer deferred. Is the right honorable gentleman prepared to go back on the solemn statement made by him when Prime Minister that he would Le no party to any attempt to alter the decision of the Parliament in a way that might cause Melbourne to continue the Seat of Government for another twenty years? It is admitted by those who have no axe to grind, that Dalgety is an eligible site, and that being so, I urge honorable members to allow the decision of the last Parliament to remain undisturbed. It is useless for any honorable member to attempt to draw a red herring across the trail. Victoria has as much right as has any State to a means of access to the Federal Capital. The Premier of New South Wales, the other day took exception to the fact that we desire to .have means of access to the Capital from the Border of Victoria and the sea. Let me ask him - and I have- put many questions to him without securing a reply - whether it is the desire of his Government that, the Capital shall be walled in and the people of Victoria and other States shall only be able to enter the Capital by means of the gateway that New South Wales chooses to provide? Have the people of Australia no voice in the settlement of the question? Have not the people of New South Wales voiced their views by a majority of thirty - one to one, and should not the decision arrived at be adhered, to? Are honorable members opposite going to say that they cannot represent New South Wales? We have heard a lot of silly talk about the desirableness of submitting the question to a referendum in New South Wales. Surely honorable members will not hold that it would be fair to do anything of the kind? Party moves in Sydney are being bolstered up by such proposals, but the people of Monaro are prepared to accept the decision, not of any one State, but of this Parliament as representing the determination of the people of Australia on what is decidedly an Australian question. </para>

                        <para>.- I was under the impression that the cause for such heated remarks as those to which we have just listened disappeared some months ago. I am rather surprised at the warmth exhibited&#39; by the Postmaster-General in the defence of what, if it be a sound proposition, should require no such display. I have hitherto held that the best site beyond the 100-mile limit is Tooma, and I say, without hesitation, that if we had to consider this question as a purely Australian one, without any limitations such as are imposed by the Constitution, we should decide in favour of that site. The Postmaster-General asserted that nearly every honorable, member who had visited Welaregang voted for it, although they had  previously made up their minds to support the selection of other sites. If the House is going to make a fresh selection, without any consideration for the compact made by the Premiers of the several States, then I would urge that a far more eligible site than is Dalgety can be found. </para>

                            <para>- It is idle for the honorable gentleman to indulge in double-shuffling, and to talk in that way. We know that it is mere &#34; make believe &#34; on his part. The compact to which the leader of the Opposition has referred was for some time available to only a limited number of people in the Commonwealth, and in that respect a very great mistake was made. The practical obliteration of the record of that compact, which ought from the first to have been available for the guidance of this Parliament, is. the outstanding error made in connexion with this question. Had that document been made public from the first, I am satisfied that we should have settled this question four years ago. It would have been unnecessary to expend, as we have done, large sums in connexion with the inspection of sites more than 200 miles from Sydney. Much expenditure has been incurred in the making of surveys and the publishing of pictorial pamphlets with respect to various sites beyond the 200-mile limit, which, in view of that compact, should not be considered, and in this way there has been a wilful waste of public money. We are bound to have regard to the public welfare, and therefore the compact made after careful consideration by the States Premiers must be respected by the Parliament of the Commonwealth. I recognise that, as a representative of the people, I am bound to respect the compact, notwithstanding any conclusion I may have formed as the result of the inspection of the sites that have been submitted for our consideration. I propose to do so, but if a majority of honorable members are not prepared to consider it and indicate their intention to vote for a site beyond the 200-mile limit, I shall feel justified in voting for the site which I consider to be best adapted for what is to be the home of the Federal Parliament. We have to select a site, not to please <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers, Mr. Price,</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bent,</inline> but such as &#39;will be in every way suitable for a home for the Government of the indissoluble union of the Commonwealth. We must fight for the selection of a site that will do credit to our judgment in the days to come. I have carefully read the reports, and have made a personal inspection  of various suggested sites, and I can honestly say that, of those visited by honorable members during the last four or five years, none, with the exception of Canberra, compares favorably with that to which I have given my allegiance. As the leader of the Labour Party has shown by the report of the Chief Engineer of Public Works of New South Wales,- Canberra, which comes within the compact, possesses claims for consideration to which we must give some attention. We must give <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Weedon,</inline> the engineers who have presented a detailed report on the site, every credit for having put before us a clear, tangible statement. That being so,. 1 do not see in what way the argument of the Postmaster-General applies. That honorable gentleman is in the happy position of representing a constituency in which are situated the two sites likely to come immediately into conflict, though formerly  Canberra was not included in the district represented by him. I can sympathize with the Postmaster-General in his fear that some change of opinion may come over the House on this question, but I cannot agree with his contention that there must be an alteration of the Constitution before the name of any other eligible site can be substituted for Dalgety. </para>

                            <para>- It only shows the extremes to which a person may be driven to find an argument when no reasonable argument presents itself. The Treasurer seems to have taken up the position of reporter-general on the Capital sites. It is true he tells us that he does not desire us to take notice of his reports ; but I say, with all respect to him, that if he had written those reports as a private member, and not as a Minister, we should still have given to them that credence which is due to the capacity and knowledge he displayed as an explorer in days gone by. As it is, however, when he, a Minister, who is, and should be, part of the Administration, steps out to take sides on a question of this kind, he must expect his utterances to be regarded as those of a Minister of the Crown, and not as those pf John Forrest, </para>

                    <para class="block">M.P. The Treasurer deliberately published these reports, hoping that the public would notice them, and that they would have some influence in the interests of the electorate represented by his friend, the Postmaster-General. While I am sure that the Treasurer has the knowledge necessary to guide a man to a correct opinion on such questions as that of altitude, climate, water supply, and so forth, so essential to a Capital Site, I am not satisfied that he possesses the knowledge necessary to form a final conclusion on an all important question of the kind. However,  1  feel assured that the House is nearly tired of this eternal discussion on the Federal Capital Site question, and every member would welcome the arrival of the final stage, when we shall satisfy the people with a definite conclusion. There is every reason why we should come to a decision now, if practicable, and in my opinion it is practicable. &#39; The question really resolves itself into this: Are we going to abide by the compact or are we not? If we are going to abide by the compact, then we must look for the Capital Site on territory between 100 and zoo miles from Sydney. What sites are there between those two lines? My time allowance has expired, and I can only express the hope that an effort will be made to settle the question before we enter upon the discussion of the Tariff. </para>

                        <para>. - I am sure every honorable member in his heart deprecates the speech delivered a few minutes ago by the Postmaster-General. We all know that that honorable member has what is popularly called an &#34;inflammation&#34; on this subject. Whenever it comes up for discussion he allows himself to be thrown into a heated condition wholly unbecoming to a Minister, especially when delivering himself on a subject on which we all hope the mind of the House is thoroughly open at the present time. The honorable member for South Sydney gave no justification for the Postmaster-General&#39;s attitude, because he merely drew the attention of the House to the fact that a report of a semi-official character had been made by the honorable member for Swan, and that the report was not justified by the facts. The leader of the Labour Party, it seems to me, was perfectly justified in drawing the attention of the House to the fact that this semi-official opinion was one likely to mislead the House.

                    <para class="block">Postmaster-General appeared to me to be a studied attempt to prejudice a full House against the attitude of New South Wales on this question. The honorable member is in no way justified in saying that there- is any bitterness existing on the part of the people of New South Wales with regard to the postponement of the choice of the Capital Site. But every honorable member will recognise that if the Constitution had decided that the Capital Site was to be within the boundaries of Victoria, the Victorian people would have regarded seven years as a very long time for which to delay any definite step towards a choice. The Postmaster-General has spoken as though Dalgety had been chosen in a legal, constitutional way. The honorable member knows very well that the way in which this site was chosen was so illegal and unconstitutional that the Government have not the courage to take one single step towards acquisition, because they know very well that the High Court would be moved to restrain them, on the ground that the Act was <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline> It has been pointed out most clearly by two or three legal members that before we can choose a Capital Site the territory must either be granted by New South Wales or acquired by the Commonwealth. When it was pointed out that this House was not in a position to choose a Capital Site, the Prime Minister said: &#34; Well, if the Bill does not have the effect of giving us a site, it will at least indicate the direction in which we wish to have the site &#39;chosen.&#34; And that is all the action of this Parliament stands for; it is merely an indication that at that time there was a desire that Dalgety should be submitted to this Parliament and placed at the disposal of the Commonwealth by the New South Wales Government. I feel very! strongly against the Capital ever being fixed in any great city. It has been frequently stated in the House, and I have often heard it in private conversation with Victorians, that they would rather see the Federal Capital in Sydney than on what they call a &#34; bush &#34; site. The honorable and learned member for Angas has pointed out that so far as a site has been chosen, it is a bush site ; and that this result is entirely the work of the Victorian people, through their representative, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner. It was proposed that the Capital should be in New South Wales, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner, rather than have it fixed in Sydney, proposed to the Premier of New South Wales that the chosen site should be beyond 100 miles from Sydney. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. It was through <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner&#39;s intervention restricting the territory to an area not less than roo miles from Sydney, and although the present leader of the Opposition tried to get the limit reduced to seventy-five miles, the other Premiers would not consent. I am in favour&#34; of the Federal Capital being away from any of the large cities. Every honorable member who has been in this House during the last six years must have clearly recognised that the effect of the Seat of Government being in this city has given the State of Victoria an enormous advantage over the other States. Three or four years ago I submitted to the House a calculation which I had made, and which showed the effect on the voting power of this House. My calculation showed, and the divisions showed, that although New South Wales, by reason of her greater population, was entitled to a sixth more representation in this House, Victoria had enjoyed one-sixth more voting power than New South Wales. </para>

                            <para>- A great deal, because it shows that it is unfair to the other States to establish the Federal Seat of Government in the capital of a State. I do not care whether the city chosen were Sydney or Adelaide, the same unfairness would result to the other States. Another great advantage of having the Federal Capital in the country, would be that none of us would have anything to do but the work of Parliament. My firm belief, based on nearly seven years&#39; experience in this House, is that if the Capital of Australia were on neutral ground, and the members had not any other business to occupy them, they would begin work at ten o&#39;clock, im the morning, and probably the session&#34; would be finished in three months at most. We should be free from the influence of the local press, whether of Sydney or Melbourne, and I undertake to say that Parliament as a whole would be a freer Parliament on neutral ground than it can be in any State Capital. One word in regard to the attitude of New South Wales. I do not think the Victorian people quite realize how New South Wales regards the question. I have witnessed no bitterness on. the part of .the New South Wales people,, though I have observed considerable disappointment. And I am not surprised, because, as honorable members will recollect, about three years ago the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> newspaper deliberately advocated the election of a bunch of four senators from Victoria, on the ground that they had declared themselves in favour of an unlimited&#39; or indefinite postponement of the choice of a (Capital Site; and 80,000 people voted for those four. Then the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> actually had an article to this effect - &#34; It is true,&#34; it said, &#34; that under the Constitution the Capital Site is to be in New South Wales, but the Constitution does not say when the site is to be chosen, and, therefore, we are justified &#34; - and I use almost the newspaper&#39;s very words - &#34; in applying to this question the principle of the <inline font-style="italic">Merchant of Venice,</inline> and saying that you shall have your pound of flesh, although when you get it- is entirely another matter.&#34; When the two leading newspapers of this State take up that attitude, it is not surprising that the New South Wales people should begin to take a somewhat hopeless view of the question. I should like to say, in reply to the fervid remarks of the Postmaster-General, that, so far from the people of New South Wales feeling bitterly towards the people of Victoria in this matter, they are only suffering; grievous disappointment because of the lack of the true Federal spirit which should lead the representatives of Victoria and of all the States to readily fulfil the obligations laid upon them by the Constitution. </para>

                    <para>.- I oppose the motion, because I think that the  Chairman  of Committees, if we are to have such an officer, should be chosen at the beginning of each session. However well a member may fill this position, even if he does so as splendidly as you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> have done - and you are the best  Speaker  in whose presence I have spoken - the shorter his term of office the better. I do not hold with the election of a member of the House to either the position which you ornament or the Chairmanship of Committees, because thereby a political party loses votes, and a constituency is disfranchised at every division. Those who have held the Speakership in the Legislative Assembly of Victoria have had very sorry experiences. For instance, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Graham</inline> Berry was not again returned to political life after he had acted as <inline font-weight="bold">Speaker. Mr. Bent</inline> lost his seat and his deposit of &#163;50 when presenting himself for re-election after having filled that office. </para>

                        <para>- You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> have performed your duties in an exceptional manner, and have, therefore, no reason to fear for your seat. I am not speaking against you in any way. But the best ruled Parliament in the world, that which legislates for the country to which every politician looks as to the political schoolhouse of Europe - I. refer to Switzerland - is presided over by a  President  and a  Chairman  of Committees, both of whom are elected only for the session, while no  President  can hold office during two consecutive sessions. If a division is called for I shall vote against the motion, because I think it my duty to protest against the proposal to lengthen the term of office of the  Chairman  of Committees. The last occupant of the chair is a friend of mine, and a member of the party to which I belong. Therefore I am not animated by any personal feeling in this matter. I maintain that three years is too long a term, and although I have not seen what I complain of in this Parliament, I know that in other. Parliaments the competition for such a position has. led to the consulting of whisky bottles in private rooms on too many occasions. </para>

                <para>The object in view would be obtained By the striking out of the words &#34; each session.&#34; If the motion before the House be carried, we shall be able to get rid of the existing  Chairman  only by moving directly for his removal, whereas if the standing order were amended in the way I suggest, the appointment of some one else could be moved without the need for invidious action against the present occupant of the chair, or unpleasant references to the manner in which his duties had -been discharged. The intention of the Government seems to be merely to avoid the need for appointing a  Chairman  every session. I do not know that there is any objection to making the appointment every session ; but there is an objection on the score of policy to continually changing Chairmen, when there is no strong reason for such action. The principle I have endeavoured to follow from the beginning, and which will regulate my vote on the next motion, is that a member who has carried out the duty of  Chairman  of Committees fairly well should be retained in that position. </para>

I propose that the honorable member for Kennedy be appointed  Chairman,  because of his wide parliamentary experience. Before his election to this House he was a member of the Queensland Parliament. Ever since the inauguration of Federation he has been a temporary  Chairman  of Committees here, and last session filled the position of  Chairman.  I think that all those who saw him in that position will admit that he filled his office to the general satisfaction of honorable members. He was impartial, courteous to all, and anxious to advance the interests of honorable members in every way possible.  His  knowledge of the Standing Orders and of parliamentary customs is perhaps unrivalled, with the exception of your own, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> If honorable members again show him their confidence, I think that they will have every reason to regard his appointment with the greatest satisfaction. </para>

                    <para>.- I second the motion. This is not an occasion whereon the merits of the candidate for office need be extolled. As has been very properly said by the honorable member for Boothby, the honorable member for Kennedy has already fulfilled the duties of the  Chairman  of Committees with honour and credit to us and to himself, and with an ability and impartiality such as we hope his successors will emulate. It has been said that his knowledge of Standing Orders is unsurpassed by that of any one except yourself, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> But what  is  more important as a qualification for the occupant of this office  is  that he. should exhibit absolute impartiality regarding every party, interest and individual in the Chamber. I have the greatest confidence in recommending the honorable member for Kennedy as a gentleman who will deal faithfully and fairly with honorable members, and who will perform his duties with credit to the important post for which he is a candidate. </para>

                    <para>. - Perhaps I may be pardoned for saying a word or two upon this occasion. I desire to thank very heartily indeed those honorable members who were good enough to express their confidence in me by recording their votes in my favour. I am particularly pleased that I received the support of a number of honorable members who, by their votes, showed that they did not regard this matter from a party standpoint. In my opinion the election of the  Chairman  of Committees - an election to a position of great honour and dignity - should be entirely free from any partisan spirit, and it affords me the greatest possible pleasure to reflect that in the division which has just taken place I did not receive the undivided support of any particular party in this House. I thank honorable members very sincerely, and I need hardly assure the honorable member for Kennedy that if at any time my services can be of value to him, they are at his command. I feel certain that the traditions of this House and of the Mother of Parliaments, upon which our procedure is modelled, are perfectly safe in his hands, and that honorable members will have no cause to regret the step which has been taken to-day. </para>

                    <para>.- During the progress of this debate a good deal of criticism has been levelled by members of the direct Opposition against the Government and against the members of the Labour Party. Consequently I propose to offer a little criticism upon the position occupied by members of the Opposition. They have described the manner in which the Labour Party conducted the recent elections. I need hardly say that they have not had the temerity to confront us in this House with some of the absurd misrepresentations which were made to do duty during the late campaign. I propose to quote a few of their mis-statements, so that honorable members opposite may have an opportunity of substantiating them, and so that the party with which I am associated may be afforded an opportunity of replying. No such opportunity was afforded us during the late elections, except to a very limited extent. Upon the other hand, a statement had merely to be made by the leader of the Opposition in the privacy of his own chamber to insure its insertion in large type in. the daily papers of the following day, through whose medium it probably reached from 80,000 to 100,000 individuals. Corrections of these accusations made by the Labour Party reached only the handful of people who happened to be listening to the speakers at political meetings, because the daily press of Australia deliberately refused to give to our views the publicity which they gave to the utterances of our opponents. At the recent election we were assured by the leader of the Opposition that the supreme issue before the people was that of Socialism <inline font-style="italic">versus</inline> anti-Socialism. It is a notable circumstance that the right honorable member has not attempted to define either Socialism or anti-Socialism. He was content to put this airy issue before the electors, and I may add that in support of it a number of misstatements and fabrications were employed which did not reflect credit upon the .persons who used them. But, although the leader of the Opposition declared that the issue was one of Socialism <inline font-style="italic">versus</inline> anti-Socialism, when speaking at Toowoomba, a little time ago, he practically proclaimed&#39; himself a Socialist. He said - </para>

                <para class="block">Hi made that statement in 1901, and yet at the last election he declared himself an anti-Socialist. The charge was also levelled against the Labour Party that its members were a lot of atheists. I hold in. my hand a pamphlet which was printed by the Democratic Union, of which the right honorable member is  president,  in which the following passages occur: - </para>

                <para class="block">This pamphlet was broadcasted throughout Australia at the last elections in opposition tj the Labour Party. To my mind, it would be more honorable for the leader of the Opposition to make these- charges upon the. floor of the House where we have an opportunity of replying to them. I would further point out that in the first session of this Parliament the leader of the Opposition, who has charged other people with having introduced it, made some statements concerning the sectarian question. Upon the nth January of this year, in referring to the Labour Party, he said - </para>

                <para class="block">That is nothing short of a barefaced false hood. I contradicted it in the daily newspapers of Sydney, and have- lost no opportunity to deny the assertion that the Labour Party has recognised any religious body, either on the one side or the other. An honorable member occupying so exalted a position as is that of the leader of the Opposition ought not to make such statements merely for the purpose of securing votes. During the debate we have been told by the right honorable gentleman that the direct Opposition do not represent the capitalists of Australia. Let us test that assertion. At the general election the right honorable gentleman asserted that the issue was Socialism <inline font-style="italic">versus</inline> anti-Socialism, and that there were only two parties before the country. I find that the Employers&#39; Federation is reported&#39; in the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> of 15th April, 1905, to have carried this resolution - </para>

                <para class="block">If it be true, that there were only two parties before the country, can it be said that the Employers&#39; Federation supported the Labour Party? In such circumstances they must have supported the leader of the Opposition and his followers, who must&#39; be here to-day as representing the Employers&#39; Federation of Australia. Then again, the  president  of the Sydney Chamber of Commerce is reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> of 12th April, .1905, to have said - </para>

                </quote>
                <para class="block">Did not the Chambers of Commerce support the right honorable gentleman and his policy of anti- Socialism ? I say that they did, and that these capitalistic institutions are ranged behind the right honorable member and his party who are here to-day to do their bidding. It was also, asserted during the election campaign that the Labour Party desired to destroy the sanctity of the home and the marriage tie. I am aware that the leader of the Opposition, when pressed, repudiated the statement, but his followers gave voice to it all over the country. The honorable member &#39;for Lang during the course of the campaign said that the Labour Party were Socialists, that the Socialists were endeavouring to break up the marriage tie, and that consequently the Labour Party were doing so. Despite our statements, and the passing of resolutions at Labour Conferences, to the contrary, these deliberate falsehoods &#39;were spread broadcast over Australia with the sole object of side-tracking the electors, and preventing them from voting on the clear issue before them. I propose now to devote some attention to the  deputy  leader of the Opposition, the honorable member for Parramatta, who has been touring the country denouncing the caucus and the Socialism of the Labour Party. He has declared that the land tax proposals of our party mean confiscation, and has made various other charges against us. I do not know whether honorable members generally are aware that the  deputy  leader of the Opposition was first returned by the Labour Party to the Parliament of New South Wales; that he was taken by them from the coal mines of Lithgow, and sent into the State Parliament. Some of the planks upon which he was elected read as follows : - </para>

                        <para>- There is nothing to hide. I am endeavouring to show that the honorable member for Parramatta is a political turn-coat. I warn honorable members in the Opposition corner who have not yet .made up their minds to which  party they are going to attach themselves, that if they join with the honorable member for Parramatta, he will desert them the .moment he finds that by association with them his own interests are at stake. During the election campaign, the honorable member for Parramatta, as I have said, referred to the land tax proposals of the Labour Party as meaning confiscation. When he was first returned to the Parliament of New South Wales, he was a very strong supporter of land taxation, as &#34;I shall show by putting before honorable members quotations from speeches made by him and reported in the New South Wales <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> Speaking in the State Legislative Assembly on the financial statement, he is reported in , <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> volume 62, page 381.4, to have made the following statement : - </para>

                    <para>It has been asserted to-night that those  who  dare say a word concerning the operations of our fleet are disloyal to the Mother Country. I repudiate any such assertion. The honorable member who made so much of loyalty to-night was mistaking loyalty for servility. Those who rebel against all servility cannot, therefore, be called disloyal. . . . The limit of loyalty of any people must always be determined by a sense of obligation to one&#39;s own people. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>That last clause, referring to the &#34;limit of loyalty,&#34; fairly describes the attitude of the Labour Party to-day in relation to an Australian Navy. Those who call themselves anti- Socialists turn to the Labour Party and say - &#34; You are in favour of nationalizing monopolies ; and if you are in favour of nationalizing some things, you must be in &#39;favour of nationalizing all things.&#34; That is a most absurd argument, but I may turn it against the anti-Socialists, and say to them, &#34; If you are anti-Socialists, you must mean to convert all the undertakings which to-day are socialistic in Australia into undertakings conducted by private enterprise.&#34; The public debt of Australia is about &#163;236,000,000, and of that &#163;195,000,000 are invested in socialistic undertakings by the various States. Amongst these undertakings are railways and tramways, representing &#163;136,000,855 ; telegraphs and telephones, .&#163;3,750,000; water supply and sewerage, &#163;29,000,000; harbor and river works, &#163;17,000,000; defence, &#163;2,500,000; immigration, &#163;3,000,000; advances to settlers, &#163;508,000 ; land for settlement, &#163;745,000 ; and loans to local bodies, &#163;2,416,000; total, &#163;195,000,000. If those gentlemen who call themselves anti-Socialists are sincere they must contemplate overturning all this socialistic work and experiment carried out by the States Governments and handing the undertakings over to private enterprise. But we know quite well that they do not contemplate any steps of the kind, and that their anti-Socialism is only so much humbug. If from the public platform they were to tell the people of Australia that such was the meaning of their anti- Socialism, they would get very short shrift from the electors. Their argument can be aptly illustrated by a case, in which a doctor, summoned to attend a patient suffering from some physical infirmity, prescribed a bottle of medicine composed of. amongst other drugs. a few drops of chloroform. The medical man was of opinion that three or four drops of chloroform, in combination with the other materials, would afford a cure for the disease. </para>

                        <para>- No; the doctor thought that the combination would bring about certain desired effects. Now, according to the argument of the anti-Socialists, it might have been said in this case, that if three drops of chloroform were good, a whole bottle full would be better. The Labour Party, in laying down a remedy for the diseases of the body politic, have come to the conclusion that so many drops of Socialism will be good for the people. When a monopoly works injuriously to the general public, to the employes in the industry, and to producers of raw material, then the Labour Party contend that the time has arrived when the monopoly must be taken over and conducted by the people in the interests of all. But the anti-Socialists continue to advance the ridiculous argument that because the Labour Partypropose to administer two or three drops of Socialism, they intend to take over everything - to nationalize people&#39;s houses and have State kitchens, to nationalize the children, and, doing away with the marriage tie, have free selection of wives. These are the sort of statements made by the anti-Socialists on platforms throughout the Commonwealth on occasions when they are reported, while the speeches of the Labour Party are ignored by the press ; but they do not dare advance such arguments in this House, where they can be refuted. In the course of this debate the honorable member for Hindmarsh referred to a publication called the <inline font-style="italic">Patriot,</inline> issued by the Treasurer in Western Australia, and he told us that the issue which he had seen, that of the 22nd November, bore an intimation that it was registered as a newspaper for transmission through the post. Subsequent inquiries, however, showed that the paper had not been registered until 7th December, and that there had been no issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Patriot</inline> after 22nd November. This paper would pass through the post-office at the smaller rate fixed for registered newspapers ; and I am greatly disappointed that no statement or explanation has been given to us by the Treasurer. I hope the Postmaster-General will make some inquiries into the occurrence. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad to hear that from the Postmaster-General. I conducted a newspaper in New South Wales for four years, which was registered for transmission through the post. With that newspaper was a supplement, Which also bore an intimation that it was registered, but when I asked the postal authorities whether it could be sent at the lower rate, seeing that the newspaper itself was registered, I received the reply that the supplement could not, and that, by making an intimation to the effect that it could, I had rendered myself liable to prosecution. </para>

                        <para>- It was merely an electioneering placard, containing some of the greatest misrepresentations that could be made, and it could not by any stretch of the imagination be called a newspaper. However, I am glad to hear the Postmaster-General say that he will make inquiries, and deal with those, if there are any, who are responsible for the occurrence. What has been the result of the great electioneering campaign conducted by those who are called anti-Socialists ? They started out with the intention to abolish the three party system in this House - to reduce the number of parties to two - but the leader of the Opposition has only succeeded in creating an extra party, the members of which, so far as I can see, though returned on the anti-Socialist ticket, object to sit with him and his colleagues, and have taken their places in the corner. Then the honorable member for Fremantle was elected as an anti- Socialist, but in the very first speech he made in this House he declared himself in favour of State insurance as opposed to old-age pensions. There is also the fact that, while the leader of the Opposition says he is going to vote for the reduction of the Tariff, the  deputy  leader has signified that he is not going to offer any obstacle to the raising of the Tariff by the protectionists, because he recognises that there is a majority in the House in favour of protection. That is a pretty attitude ! * </para>

                <para class="block">What sort of party would the Labour Party be if every time they found a majority against them, they gave up the fight for their principles ? As soon, however, as the members of the Opposition find a majority against them they, because they cannot get on to the Treasury benches and enjoy the emoluments of office, turn their coat, and practically fall in with those who have previously been their opponents. Then what is the attitude of the honorable member for Dalley, who has interrupted me on several occasions? That honorable member has been a professed free-trader, but he now says, &#34; I am not going to be an out-and-out free-trader any longer; I shall vote protection so far as my electorate is concerned.&#34; And he soon gave us an earnest of his intentions in this House. These are the effects of the campaign of the leader of the Opposition ; a fourth party has been created, and his own party torn into shreds and patches. The leader of the Opposition has stated that he was told there were practically only two parties in the House on a division - one party for the Government and one against - but he said, &#34; What is the good of our challenging the Government when the Labour Party has come to a caucus decision to support the Government?&#34; That is a peculiar way for the right honorable gentleman to get out of his responsibility. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know where he got his information, but I do know that it is not correct. Every member of the Labour Party is free to vote in any way he likes upon the Address-in-Reply, and yet the members of the Opposition shelter themselves behind this creation of their own imagination. Why does the Opposition not test the feeling of the House? They know that if they did so, they would find themselves in a very ridiculous position. It would appear from the newspapers that there is a majority in the House in favour of anti-Socialism; but if the Opposition moved an amendment to the Address-in-Reply, or a no-confidence motion, they would soon find out how they stand. While the honorable member for Dalley is going to be a protectionist to a certain degree, and the  deputy  leader of the Opposition is not going to offer any resistance to the raising of the Tariff, the honorable member for Lang is determined to offer  every resistance, and will take every opportunity to reduce the Tariff. These are members of a party which a little while ago was banded together on the one sacred issue of free-trade. There has been so much ignorance displayed by the members of the Opposition as to the Labour Party&#39;s objective, platform and pledge, that I propose to now place on record what the platform and pledge are. &#39; They are as follow :  - </para>

                <para class="block">The  Chairman  of the Chamber of Manufactures here practically calls on us to provide for the running of State-owned cargo steamers, and thus supports a socialistic proposal. The next plank on the Labour Party&#39;s programme is the holding of a referendum on the Tariff question. When a proper Tariff has been framed we wish to hold a referendum so that the people may vote &#34; yes &#34; or &#34; no &#34; in regard to it, and the matter may be settled for a definite time. No one deprecates more the division of parties by the fiscal question than does the Labour Party, and no party is more ready to come to a fight with its opponents on a straight-out issue.  0.ur  next plank is the imposition of a progressive tax upon unimproved land values. I regret that no mention is made in the Speech of the intention to impose a land tax. Paragraph  9  speaks of the increase of immigration as not being commensurate with our needs or opportunities. Then paragraph 15 refers to the steps taken for the repatriation of Australians from South Africa, a socialistic step which has been indorsed by the Premiers of the States and by the Opposition. The fault I have to find with the Government is that they propose to encourage immigration, and thus increase the competition in our labour market, without trying to remedy the existing land monopoly. Any scheme of immigration which is independent of a proposal for putting an end to the land monopoly is absurd.

                        <para>- Although the honorable member is trying to cast ridicule upon the Labour Party, the party to which he belongs is copying our methods of organization. The Governor-General made reference to the Imperial Conference. The Prime Minister represented my views there when he advocated preferential trade and the establishment of a Secretariat. With regard to paragraph 4 of the speech, I shall assist the Government to my utmost in trying to make the Tariff effective upon the lines of the new protection, which considers the employes as well as the employers. In paragraph 6 of the speech is an indirect reference to old-age pensions. I am dissatisfied, because the Government have not made some definite proposal for the establishment of old-age pensions. The proposal has been dangled before the electors sufficiently long, and the time has arrived when it should be given effect to. The leader of the Opposition, speaking at the Town Hall, Sydney, about three years ago, ridiculed Federal old-age pensions. He said that the Labour Party were advocating the adoption of a Federal scheme of old-age pensions, and declared that it was cruel to hold out any such hope to the old people of Australia, seeing that it was impossible to give effect to it during the period of the operation of the Braddon section of the Constitution. I notice that the right honorable member is now advocating the establishment of a Federal old-age pension scheme, while favouring a continuation of the Braddon section. I do not know how he can reconcile his attitude of to-day with that which he adopted three years ago. Paragraph 7 of the GovernorGeneral&#39;s Speech deals with the proposed transfer of the Northern Territory. I have no desire to dwell at length upon that question now, but when the proposed transfer is under consideration, I shall have something to say upon it. Whilst the Government are attempting to encourage the productions of Australia, I hope that they will not fail to offer substantial encouragement to its tropical productions. If we were to offer inducements to white settlers to cultivate products which are indigenous to the Northern Territory^ </para>

                <para class="block">A statement like that, coming from an admitted authority upon the question in New South Wales, which I suppose is the most prosperous State in the Commonwealth today, does not provide very entertaining reading. This Parliament ought, I contend, to endeavour to bridge the gulf between :the great prosperity of the country and the poverty of the working classes. We ought to insure that the latter shall obtain some fair share of the prosperity which an all-wise Providence has bestowed upon us. I come now to the question of the Federal Capital. In my judgment, the greatest obstacle to the settlement of that question is the Premier of New South Wales, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.- Carruthers.</inline> He has adopted an extremely unfederal attitude for a considerable time past. Not only does he wish to upset the decision arrived at by this Parliament, but he desires to dictate the course of action which we shall follow in respect to the Northern Territory. Whilst a party of members of the Commonwealth Parliament were inspecting the Territory for themselves, with a view to acquiring a knowledge of local conditions and of its future, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers</inline> at a Conference of Premiers in Brisbane, was endeavouring to induce the other Premiers to adopt an attitude of open hostility to the Commonwealth taking over that Territory.  His  action under all the circumstances was most unjustifiable. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers,</inline> it will be recollected, was a member of the Federal Convention, and one who avowed himself a great Federalist. Yet he now proposes to take a referendum of the electors of New South Wales upon the question of whether that State shall secede from the Federation. In short, he minds everybody&#39;s business but his own. I am of opinion that by the time he answers all the questions relating to the land scandals in New South Wales, which will be put to him during the approaching general elections in that State, he will have had ample to explain. It would be a sorry matter  indeed if New South Wales had to depend upon <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers,</inline> to see that justice was done to her in Federal affairs. In connexion with the Federal Capital, it is interesting to note that during the last Parliament, the leader of the Opposition expressed himself as follows : - </para>

                    <para>.- As a new member, it is not my intention to occupy the time of the House at any great length. Most of the subjects enumerated in the Governor-General&#39;s Speech have been dealt with by some of the older and more prominent members of the House, and therefore I shall not weary it with a reiteration of the various planks embodied in the Vice-Regal utterance. I should like to preface my remarks by adding my testimony to that which has already been given by other honorable members to the splendid manner in which the Prime Minister represented Australia at the Imperial Conference. Whatever opinions we may entertain as to the concrete results of that Conference, we must all admire the way in which he represented the Commonwealth in the Councils of the Empire. It seems to me that he has lifted the prestige of the Commonwealth to a level with that of other nations of the world, and the value of his work cannot very well be measured by words. In the first place, I should like to touch upon the question of immigration. So far, that subject does not appear to have been dealt with very fully, although it is one of the most important, if not the most important, question of public policy with which we shall be called upon to deal in the near future. I regret that it does not occupy a more prominent position in the Government platform. It seems to me that whatever policy may be adopted by this House, it will be valueless unless we have the people within . the Commonwealth to give effect to it. At this early stage in our history, it seems to me that what we require more than anything else is a broad, bold, developmental policy. If we are going to initiate such a policy - and I hope that we shall, certainly several planks in the Ministerial platform indicate that the Government recognise the necessity for so doing - side by side with it we shall have to adopt an immigration scheme. During the past few months, I have had an opportunity of travelling through various parts of Australia, and my opinion is that nearly every branch of craft and industry within the Commonwealth is starving for want of more people and more labour. Within the agricultural areas of Victoria, there is .a desire for more labour and an inability to get it. In very many manufacturing industries the same want is felt. We have not sufficient labour in the Commonwealth to properly carry on the great industries which have been .already established. If it be our desire to establish additional industries, we must have .more labour in order .to develop those industries. If we look at the history of America, we find that the great secret qf her progress is that she has invited immigrants to enter her territory and assist in her development. I think that the Commonwealth Parliament .has been wiser than America in that it has passed an Immigration Restriction Act, which prevents the admission of &#34;undesirables.&#34; But we have made a mistake in refusing to allow the desirables to come in. Contemporaneously with the initiation of legislation in the direction of protection to native industries and the development of our various primary products, we need to secure a large influx of the desirable class in order that we may extend those industries by a supply of more labour. </para>

                        <para>- The point that I wish to make is that the Government should initiate a comprehensive scheme of assisted immigration. There is plenty of room for a desirable class of immigrants in nearly every branch of industry in the Commonwealth. I am- pleased to learn that it is the intention of the Government to submit Tariff resolutions at an early date. As a protectionist, I believe that we should frame an effective Tariff in order that we may develop to the full the national industries of Australia. We know that the Commonwealth is rich in natural resources. It possesses climates and soils which enable it to grow every product that it is possible to raise in any part of the world. In mineral resources we have yet to learn that we .are inferior to America. And yet we know that America, during the last 100 years, has increased its population at the rate of from 750,000 to 1,000,000 per annum, whilst we have remained practically stati&#39;onary. Our population should be increasing at the rate of 300,000 or 400,000 per annum. </para>

                        <para>- I think that by the use of proper machinery a classification could be conducted without trouble. In this connexion I am pleased to observe that it is the intention of the Government to appoint a High Commissioner in order that in the event of a comprehensive scheme being carried we may have in Great Britain the machinery for the_ selection of immigrants in such a way as to prevent Australia being flooded by an undesirable class. It  was  my privilege recently to visit the Northern Territory, but I shall not deal at length with the question of its transfer, since it must be discussed at a later stage. Without referring to the tentative agreement between the Commonwealth and South Australian Governments, except in so far as to express the opinion that some of its provisions require to be modified or amended, I may say that my impression of the Territory is that it is a white man&#39;s country, and that it has within it all the elements of a great development. I believe that it has great mineral and agricultural possibilities, and that in the course of time it will become one of the important States of Australia. We import every year &#163;6,000,000 or  &#163;7,000,000 worth of fibres and products of a tropical character, the whole of which, by the extension of reasonable Government assistance to settlers, could be grown within that territory. The general development of that part of the Commonwealth is, however, a matter of money, -and I was very pleased to observe that the honorable and learned member for Flinders last night gave special prominence to the necessity of settling the financial difficulties between the States and the Commonwealth in order that many great developmental schemes now pending might be carried out to the general well-being of the nation. A large expenditure is vitally necessary in connexion with the Northern Territory. It could hardly be expected that a newly-populated prosperous and civilized State could be added to the Union without a very considerable outlay, and the probability is that we shall have to spend something like  ^10,000,000  or  ^12,000,000  before we can lay even the foundation of anything like a prosperous settlement in the Northern Territory. We know that it has cost every State of the Union from  &#163;20,000,000  to  &#163;25,000,000  to lay down the foundations of proper settlement, and from that experience we can gather what will be our experience in connexion with the Territory. We have to find out, in the first instance, whether it can be populated and developed by white races. That is one of the elements necessary to making it a State, and having decided that it can be so populated and developed, it will be for the genius of the Commonwealth to devise a policy that will enable it to be properly improved.  There are many points in the Governor- General&#39;s Speech that might be touched upon in the course of this debate, but we know that every one of them will later on form the subject of discussion. In passing, however, I should like to refer to the trouble constantly arising in connexion with the selection of the site of the Federal Capital. It is unfortunate that the time of the House has to be wasted over a matter that, after all, does not make for any large development in the Government of Australia. As one of the electors of the Commonwealth, I was under the impression that the Capital Site question had been settled. I find now that there is a desire on the part of the Parliament to re-open it. </para>

The Constitution clearly gives us the right to choose an area in any part of New South Wales, as long as it is outside the prescribed limit of  100  miles from Sydney. However, I am not going to discuss in detail what is the true interpretation of section  125  of the Constitution. All I know is that the House in its wisdom, and after full discussion, has settled this question, and it seems to me that we should not reopen it without substantial reason being given. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. We have reached a stage at which we should undertake some of our very large schemes of development, such, for instance, as those for the expansion of our primary industries by means of bounties or other methods, the development of our manufacturing industries bv a proper system of protection, and the general development of our mineral resources.

                <para class="block">Continent shall be used for irrigation purposes. We have in Australia large areas over which there is but a limited rainfall. But nature has provided us with some of the finest rivers in the world, notable among which are the Murray, the Murrumbidgee, and the Darling. At present they are almost useless, because we are failing to take advantage of the splendid opportunities which offer to chain their waters for irrigation purposes. If we were sufficiently seized of the splendid possibilities that we are allowing daily to pass by we should not permit this question to remain  one hour longer in abeyance. Certain difficulties have arisen under the Constitution in respect to the control of these rivers, and the riparian rights attaching to them, and these are obstacles to our dealing with them. We have the control of the navigation, but the question of control, so far as irrigation is concerned, is not expressly dealt with in the Constitution. The absolute control of the waters of these rivers must, in the course of time, pass over to the Commonwealth, and it requires only the consent of the States to enable that change to take place. By vesting the Commonwealth Parliament with the riparian rights to the waters of these three large rivers, and placing their disposition under an InterState Commission, which is already provided for in the Constitution, the States would be enabled to carry out their large schemes of irrigation without being hampered by State jealousies, or the differences of opinion that have arisen in times gone by in reference to this all important question. I believe that for the great bulk of the future primary production of Australia we must look to irrigation schemes stimulated by the use of the waters of our rivers, and that is why I consider that the settlement of the riparian rights in respect of the principal rivers in the Commonwealth is one of the most important tasks with which we could be called upon to deal. It is a question that will certainly have to be determined in the near future, if we are going to make as much use of these waters as we ought, as an enlightened people, to do. We should be stimulated by the splendid success of irrigation in older countries, and notably in the United States of America and Egypt. I shall not further occupy the time of honorable members, although every, one of the subjects mentioned in the Governor- General&#39;s Speech are of vital interest to me. I may have more than the degree of optimism usually found in a new member, but I hope and believe that the House will settle down to the great foundational work of nation building, to the settlement of the financial relations of the States and the Commonwealth, and to the upbuilding of a great developmental policy for Australia, causing this nation to rank, as it deserves, among the foremost in the world. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to say a few words on the Address-in-Reply. First, although only a new member, I regret very much that the old, time-honoured custom of invoking the Divine blessing on our labours has been neglected by the Government of the day. The honorable member for South Sydney referred to the recent State elections in Queensland, and to the &#34;set back&#34; that what he termed the Conservative Party had there received. The Labour Party in that State went to the <inline font-style="italic">country as</inline> a party, and came back fifteen in number less than they set out. If the Labour Party call that progress, I am quite satisfied that that kind of progress shall continue for some time. </para>

                        <para>- In toe last State Parliament in Queensland the Labour Party numbered, I think, thirty -one or thirty-four, and they came back from the elections numbering eighteen or fourteen, as the case may be - I do not know the exact figures. However, the point is immaterial, except that I desire to disabuse the minds of honorable members of any idea that the Labour Party have made such rapid strides in Queensland since the last Federal election. As to the Imperial Conference, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> while in England, assumed an aggressive attitude which we all commend, and of which I for one am proud. , But, unfortunately for himself, and I think for the Commonwealth, he adopted quite a different attitude when he returned to Australia, and found himself, I suppose, to some extent in &#34; deep water.&#34; Some time ago I noticed in the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> a cartoon depicting the courage of the Prime Minister while in London, the honorable- gentleman being shown holding up a hoop on which was inscribed, &#34; Preferential Tariff,&#34; and at the same time pinching the lion&#39;s tail and saying, &#34;Jump, you beggar.&#34; Speaking still in a metaphorical way, I may say that when he came to Australia, and saw the Australian kangaroo, he pleaded with that animal not to jump - in other words, he retracted what he had said in London. It is hard to understand what the Prime Minister thought, or does now think, of the Imperial Conference.

                <para class="block">Paragraph  4  of  His  Excellency&#39;s Speech refers to the Tariff Commission. I am pleased to learn that the Commissioners have almost finished their labours, and that we shall shortly have before us a Bill dealing with the much-vexed question of the Tariff. I may state that I, was returned with a mandate from my electorate, to secure protection for Australian industries,, and so far as I can assist the Government in passing reasonable protective measures,. I shall be pleased to do so. The question of bounties is also referred to in the GovernorGeneral&#39;s Speech. I do not know that I am altogether fascinated with tha idea of giving bounties to encourage industries. We should give every industry the protection necessary to foster it, and if that be done, industries will spring up without the aid of bounties. In some instances bounties are necessary; but I can assure the House that I shall do my best to make sure that any bounties .granted, shall go to the producers. In the State of Queensland we have had some experience of bounties paid by the State Government for cotton growing; and in that State, as well as in the other States, a little assistance might be given in that way to this industry. But the State Government hedged the bounty round with the condition that about 5,000 bales must be produced in order to obtain the bounty, with the result that the cotton company got the money, whilst the growers did the work, the producer in that instance not receiving- the benefit intended. In Victoria some time ago, another example was afforded in connexion with: the- bonuses paid to encourage the export of. butter.. It was well known to those in the trade at the time that the butter producers of Victoria reaped .no immediate benefit, though they may have received some benefit in the market as the export trade was worked up. However, the export trade would probably have expanded under any circumstances, though, perhaps, with the bonus, it advanced more quickly. </para>

When this matter of the encouragement of industries was being referred to during this debate, an honorable member interjected, &#34;As we do in the case of sugar.&#34; It is a pity that the sugar industry could not have been developed without the assistance of a bounty; and my own opinion is that it could have been helped more effectively in another way. </para>

During the last five, years there has, roughly speaking, been ^1,500,000 collected in excise on sugar in the .State of Queensland, and there has, been paid, as bounty to the sugar growers, ,&#163;250,000. These figures are. not exact, but are within a thou. sand or two of the correct amount. I ask. honorable members, as common-sense business men, to say whether that state of affairs should be allowed to continue, or. whether the sugar industry should carry that burden for all time? Of course, it was not intended that the sugar industry should bear the burden for ever; but what I have described is the actual state of affairs ; and, further, the whole weight of the bounty falls on the States, producing sugar. </para>

                        <para>- The non-producing States are credited in the. inter-State adjustment of accounts with the excise duty on all the sugar that enters those States. Victorians or South- Australians, as the. case may be, claim that they are so patriotic  and so gracious towards the White Australia policy - to which I have no objection whatever - that they bear the cost; but I contend that the cost is thrown back on the sugar-producing States of Queensland and New South Wales, the growers in which have to pay the excise duty. </para>

                        <para>- I think the honorable member is wrong; however, we may pass from that matter. I have no desire to alter existing arrangements, but I am merely throwing out the suggestion that when a Bounty Bill, or any Bill to encourage the development of certain industries, is brought before the House, our object should be to see that the producers, or the working men, as the case may be, benefit as well as the men who invest their money in the industries. Paragraph 6 of  His  Excellency&#39;s Speech refers to the financial arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States. The honorable member for South Sydney, in speaking the other evening, apparently wished us to infer that it is &#34; like the impudence &#34; of the various States to ask that if there is -a surplus over the average amount received by them during the past five years, they shall receive three-fourths of that surplus. The States Governments have their obligations, and the States have their rights, which must be conserved ; and if there cannot be -some reliance placed upon the proportional return of revenue from the Federal Government, the States Premiers will be left in a state of uncertainty in regard to their finances. </para>

                        <para>- I am open to conviction as to the desirability of transferring the debts of the States to the Commonwealth. At present I cannot see that Queensland would benefit by that transfer, and until I am convinced that it would benefit I shall oppose the taking over of the debts by the Commonwealth. The federalization of the debts of the States will mean, in the end, the handing over to the Commonwealth of the control of their railways, and, if a section of the House had its way, of their land as well. Mention is made in the speech of the Governor-General of a Commonwealth old-age pensions system, about which there has been a good deal of talk. We all sympathize with the aged poor, and would like to make their declining years comfortable. I am with the honorable member for Barrier in thinking that it would be best to provide old-age pensions for all. The cost would probably be not so heavy as some persons believe. The two oldest and most populous States have already old-age pensions schemes. In Queensland there is an indigent poor allowance, which is a pauperizing thing, having  a  degrading effect on those who receive it. Unfortunately, the desire in all this talk about old-age pensions has been not so much to relieve distress as to make political capital. I would give no opportunity &#39;for political influence in this matter. In my opinion, every person, whether poor or not, should have the right to claim a pension on attaining the age of sixty-five years. There are many poor persons in my division who shrink from asking for an allowance from the State, because they feel that they may be regarded as paupers. Strangely enough, the two States governed by Labour representatives have not provided old-age pensions for their people. No doubt the establishment of a Commonwealth old-age pensions fund would relieve the authorities of the States of the burden of supporting their aged poor, and I think that an arrangement could be made which would suit all parties. I  am   keeping an open mind with regard to the proposal to transfer the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth, though at present I am opposed to the transfer because of the great responsibility which the administration of the Northern Territory, would place upon us, and the expense entailed in developing country which contains so vast an area of unfertile land. All 1 know of the Northern Territory is that Queensland is indebted to it for a pest which has cost us hundreds of thousands of pounds. I refer to the cattle tick, whose ravages have been so disastrous to that State Coming now to the proposals for a new mail contract, there is a lot that I shall leave unsaid, because other honorable members have forestalled me. They have handled the Government pretty severely in this matter. Prior to his departure for London, the Prime Minister, speaking at an Australian Natives&#39; Association meeting, said that we were federated, but unfortunately unfederal. If any one action of the Commonwealth Government has done more than another to create an unfederal  spirit in Queensland it has been that of not making Brisbane a port of call for the European mail boats. Before the Orient steamers were brought to Brisbane, we were suffering from the very high rates of freight, especially upon butter, imposed by a shipping ring. It may surprise honorable members to learn that we were paying f d. per lb. for having our butter carried to London by a line of steamers the directors of which were paying a shipping combine <inline font-style="italic">%d&#39;.</inline> per lb., or 33^ Per cent., for the right to visit Brisbane, the combine not sending steamers there. This fact opened my eyes to the possibility of reducing the freight on butter, and an agitation was started with that object in view. Not only had we to pay this high freight for butter, but the combine compelled the steamers which were bringing goods to Brisbane to tranship them at Sydney into the coastal steamers, and to travel from Sydney to Brisbane empty. </para>

                        <para>- It has been discontinued since the Orient steamers came to Brisbane. The contention that the Commonwealth Government, in contracting for the carriage of mails, should have regard to nothing else is, I think, opposed to common sense. The Government should use the promise o&#39;f a subsidy as a powerful lever for the protection of shippers against shipping combinations, by securing reasonable rates of freight for perishable products. Ministers profess a desire to protect the workers of Australia. There are thousands of men in the Commonwealth who work, not eight, but up to eighteen, hours a day on their farms and holdings in the effort to make a living. They require consideration as much as those who work at their trades for only eight hours a day. We should protect them from the imposition of high rates of freight on the produce they send to London. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that necessary. If I thought it wise, I would support it. Like the man referred to. by the honorable member for Cook, who was satisfied with three drops of chloroform, I am disposed to commence with a small dose. The Government, in contracting for a mail service, should stipulate for reasonable rates of freight, and impose conditions which will prevent the loss of produce by the fluctuation of temperature in the holds. It should also require the maintenance of a reasonable rate of speed. To comply with the conditions of a proper contract, large steamers must be used. Their consumption of coal will be considerable, and to make a profit they must carry large quantities of cargo. No cargo is more profitable than perishable produce, and if contractors could be assured of full cargoes for their refrigerating chambers, tenders would probably be made at a low rate of subsidy. Reference has been made to the fact that the Governments of the States were asked to participate in some scheme for the carriage of cargo.  I happened to be a delegate to one of the Conferences which was held upon this question,, and the scheme which was placed before that body was wrapped up in more mystery than was the mail contract itself. We could not obtain any information from the Government as to what the cargo service was to be, or as to where it was to start from and where it was to run to. As far as our State was concerned, wa simply told the Commonwealth Government that we would be quite satisfied if they arranged for a good mail service. At the time we hoped that they would be able to do so. In the light of subsequent events, however, it appears that, not only were they unable to arrange for a cargo service, but they were also unable to arrange for an improved mail service. By their action in connexion with the mail contract, they have upset the whole commerce&#39; of Australia, so far as the shipping industry is concerned. Not one of those connected with it knows the position which he occupies. We have had to make temporary contracts for shipping,, or be left out in the cold, and I venture to say that, during the next twelve months, it will be found that our shipments of butter will be very much disorganized, owing to the interruption caused by the Commonwealth Government to a line which has been serving us tolerably well, though perhaps not quite so well as we would have liked. However, this willo&#39;thewisp undertaking has been got out of the way, and I think that any business man will admit that it was doomed to failure from the beginning. Its history dates back some few years. In 1904, the Commonwealth Government converted a Commission, which had been appointed  by,  the Victorian Government, to inquire into certain rebates made by shipping companies, to various individuals, into a Federal body. I am referring to the famous Butter Commission. The Commonwealth Government converted that Commission into a Federal body with the object of widening the scope of its inquiry. Perhaps it is merely a coincidence that in the first place <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Croker</inline> was counsel for the Victorian Government, that afterwards he acted in a similar capacity for the Commonwealth Government, and that still a few months later he was appointed agent for Messrs. Laing and Sons. If there be anything connected with the shipping business which I abhor it is the granting of rebates, which are merely the means adopted to tie shippers to a particular line of steamers. The Commonwealth Government, after endeavouring to show the people that they were their friends, attempted to secure from the States a promise to support the mail contractors, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Croker</inline> made, an effort to obtain control of the butter freights of Australia. Had he been successful, the new line of steamers would undoubtedly have been built. The butter freights of Australia are a consideration to any shipping company, and if the Government permit any outside line of steamers to get hold of them independently of our mail service, a much larger subsidy will be demanded for carrying our mails than is demanded at the present time. I have no desire to advertise any line of steamers, but speaking from experience, I say that the Orient Steam Navigation Company have made the shipping facilities of Australia what they are to-day. That company came here in the face of great opposition, and those who have done business with them during the past twenty-five years know something of the service which they have rendered to Australia. I am pleased to notice that they have come to the assistance of the Government at the present time. At this stage I wish to intimate that I cannot support any Ministry which is so unfederal in its attitude as to exclude from the itinerary of the mail steamers such an important State as Queensland. If provision be not made in the new contract for the vessels to call at Brisbane, I claim that Queensland should be exempted from contributing her share of the mail subsidy. That is the feeling throughout the northern State in respect of this matter. Paragraph 14 of the GovernorGeneral&#39;s speech reads - </para>

                <para class="block">I do not think that Queensland desires to reverse the decision of this Parliament in that connexion. Certainly a few have agitated in that direction, but personally I do not advocate the retention of the kanakas. I am just as anxious to preserve Australia white as are most people, but we ought to recollect that the persons with whom we are dealing are human beings. I credit honorable members with entertaining humane feelings even towards blackfellows. Perhaps such cases have not been brought under the notice of the Government, but several instances of extreme hardship have come under my own observation in connexion with the deportation of the kanakas. I have actually seen children torn from their parents,, the latter being deported and the children being left behind. I say that the Government should see that the deportation of these people is carried out with as little hardship to the islanders as possible. Concerning the proposed amendment of the Electoral Act, I trust that the matter will be considered very carefully, and that some system of purging the rolls will be adopted. Honorable members know that it is the easiest thing in the world to get one&#39;s name placed upon the Commonwealth electoral roll. In my own constituency I know of several glaring cases of that description. One individual in particular had his name upon the roll for the same division no less than eleven times. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know. The electors seem to send in claims every time they are asked to do so, and upon each occasion their names are placed upon the roll. During the course of this debate something has been said in reference to what is known as the &#34; new &#34; protection. My idea is that we should endeavour to legislate for the whole community, and not for any section of it. I wish to be as broadminded as possible, and consequently I sa\ that, where all parties cannot be served, we should endeavour to serve the greatest number. Under the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act which was passed by the last Parliament the manufacturers of harvesters and farm implements in Queensland, who wish to apply for exemption from the payment of excise, are required to make their applications in Melbourne, either personally or by proxy. </para>

                        <para>- That consideration only makes the existing condition of affairs worse. I hold that &#39; these applications should be dealt with in Brisbane. Of course, this is more a matter of adminis&#39;tration than anything else,  and therefore I urge the Government to look into it with a view to seeing if Queensland applicants cannot have their cases determined in that State. If, instead of sending a representative over here, they employ a Melbourne solicitor, or his agent, they find that, as is only to be expected, they do not understand the business. Unnecessary expense has to be incurred in sending a man all the way to Melbourne to do what the law requires. In paragraph 13 of  His  Excellency&#39;s Speech, we have an intimation that the Government propose to introduce a Bill providing for the transfer of the control of coastal lights from the States to the Commonwealth. I should like to see these lights taken over as soon as possible. The matter is one on which I feel strongly, and I hope that the Bill to give effect to the declared intention of the Government will not impose om light-house keepers such restrictions as prevail in New South Wales. There a light-house keeper is not permitted to entertain a friend at night without receiving special permission from the Government, although, as a matter of fact, a certain deduction, by way of rent for the premises occupied by him, is made from his allowance. I propose now to refer to the Commerce Act passed in 1905, to which no reference was made in the Speech. That measure was passed by Parliament because of an impression that it was necessary to regulate the trade and commerce of Australia. Subsequently the Minister of Trade and Customs invited trade and official representatives from the various States to meet him in Sydney to assist in drawing up regulations under the Act. I had the honour to be the trade representative of Queensland at that conference. The Minister presented his ultimatum to the delegates and then went off to his electorate presumably to make his election sure. The trades representatives resented his conduct. </para>

                        <para>- I object to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Denham</inline> doing anything of the kind just as strongly as- I object to the Commonwealth Government officials grading butter. The system has not led to any improvement in the quality of our products, and particularly of the produce that is offered for sale on the local market. As a matter of fact, it has caused to be thrown on the Australian markets a lot of inferior butter that smart business people attempt to palm off on an unsuspecting public. The oversea customer escapes this inferior article, but the local man is neglected by the Government. I am very much in favour of the American system of &#34; eating what you can, and canning what you cannot.&#34; I object to the principle that we should export our very best products, and place our inferior ones on the local market. I come now to the question of weights. The Commonwealth Government have a peculiar conception of the meaning of the words, &#34; 56 lbs. net.&#34; Let me briefly state the difficulty experienced by Queensland traders in regard to this matter. When a box of butter is opened, it weighs, with the paper wrapper, 56&#189; lbs. The average weight of the paper is 3 ozs., although sometimes it is as much as a quarter of a pound. If the paper and butter in a box weigh 56&#189; lbs., the Commonwealth Government stamp the box with the words &#34; under 56 lbs.&#34; They do not indicate what is the extent of the shortage. Each box. so treated is exported with a Commonwealth stamp upon it to the effect that it contains less than 56 lbs. of butter, whereas, even if the paper weighs a quarter of a pound, it contains56&#188; lbs. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know. This action is taken by the Customs authorities under the Commerce Act regulations. As long as I have been connected with the buttery industry, it has been the trade custom in London to weigh a percentage of all the butter offered for sale there. Although the Department of Trade and Customs may stamp butter-boxes for export in the way I have indicated, the buyer in London does not take it for granted that the Government stamp correctly sets forth the weight. He weighs a percentage of the boxes for himself. </para>

                        <para>- The injury to the butter producers is that the Government place on every box a marik. that is incorrect. It is true that we have had to make rebates in respect of short weights due to shrinkage, but there has not been any attempt to defraud the London buyer. If the Minister thinks that the buyers at Home are poor simpletons who need protection, I would invite him to have one deal with them. That would be sufficient to satisfy him that they are as smart as are most of the Australian people. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that. The: point that I wish to make, however, is that we have an army of officers employed in placing incorrect stamps on butter-boxes, and causing a great deal of inconvenience to shippers without serving any useful purpose. I do not know what is the system in the other States; but in Queensland, butter for export is very often opened on the wharfs, and exposed to the heat as well as to the micro-organisms in the atmosphere, in order simply that a Commonwealth officer may be satisfied that each box contains56&#189;1bs. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. I have been interested, although not as a middleman, in the butter industry for something like twenty-five years. My present attitude is taken up at the request of the men who milk the cows and make the butter, so that the real producer has had a voice in the matter. It is useless to say that the measure is objected to only by the commission agents. That is not so, because the Act suits the commission agents admirably, seeing that it very often takes a fair amount of responsibility from his shoulders, and places it on the shoulders of others. I should like to touch lightly on the question of immigration, and to express my pleasure that the Government have at last decided to give some encouragement in this connexion. Of course, we are all desirous to see a good class of immigrants. We are trying to get rid of the kanaka, but we have made no attempt to get rid of the Chinaman. If there is one class of people I do not wish to associate with, or to have associating with us, it is &#34;the Chinese, and next to them, I suppose, the Japanese. But, as I said in reference to the kanakas, we must be humane and fair in our treatment. I do not know who is responsible for the occurrence to which I arn about to allude. _ It appears that in China there is a system of selecting wives which is hardly ever likely to be adopted in Australia, namely, a system of obtaining them for three months on trial, at the end of which they are sent away if they do not prove satisfactory. A certain Chinaman in the Commonwealth, who is reputed to be a respectable man, sent home for a wife, and the woman was allowed to land in Australia on paying a deposit of &#163;25. The Chinaman was quite willing to pay &#163;100 and keep his wife, or intended wife, but the Commonwealth Government, through some of the Departments, were not satisfied with the wife, and decided that she must return to China at the &#34;expiration of three months. I think the Minister of Trade and Customs had something to do with this matter, and, if it be not too much trouble to him, I should be glad to know whether he, or the Chinaman himself, is to choose the latter&#39;s wife. I am not anxious to encourage- the immigration of Chinese to Australia, but if we are going to object to them, we should object at once, and not admit them on paying a deposit of &#163;25, and afterwards insist on deportation. We know before they come that they are undesirable, and I ask the Minister of Trade and Customs if he is responsible for the state of affairs I have indicated to look into the matter, and see that no hardship is inflicted in this particular case. </para>

                    <para>.- It is certainly news to me that a Chinaman, or any other coloured person, can .enter Australia on paying a deposit. I understood that the Act was passed to absolutely prohibit the introduction of any more Chinese. If the Act allows a Chinaman or his wife to enter the Commonwealth on payment of &#163;100, the sooner the Act is amended to make it absolutely prohibitive the better. When a proposal to that effect is made, I trust we shall have the assistance of the new member for Moreton, who appears to be greatly opposed to the introduction of Chinamen. As to the Commerce Act and its operation, there have been found in this city of Melbourne a number of samples of silk containing at least 50 per cent, of tin. I am quite sure that the Minister of Trade arid Customs is now pleased at the action of the honorable member for Darling and myself, when we inserted an amendment in the Commerce Bill including apparel and boots and shoes and the materials from which they are made. This amendment enables us to catch those fraudulent importers who place on the market goods which are not what they purport to be. </para>

                        <para>- Unfortunately fraudulent manufacturers are under the State law, and cannot be touched by the Commonwealth Act. When the Bill was before the House an effort was made to introduce an amendment which would also include manufacturers who put into their goods materials calculated to deceive the public, but, as I say, that is a matter that rests with the States. If we have an opportunity to amend the Constitution, as I think it ought to be amended, so as to bring the whole of commerce and trade under the Commonwealth, the desired alteration in the law will no doubt be made. The honorable member who has just .resumed his seat has told us that manufactured goods which are too poor to export to Great Britain are sold to Australians; and if that be so, I hope the party of which he is a member will urge upon the Governments of the various States to take action in order that the people of the Commonwealth may not be subject to this unfair treatment. Yesterday afternoon, when the honorable member for Barrier was concluding his speech, the honorable member for Capricornia interjected satirically that what he had said would &#34; look well in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,&#34;</inline> thus conveying the idea that the conditions described did not prevail. There is no doubt that what the honorable member for Barrier said will read well in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> because it is the absolute truth. We all remember the statement of the paid agitator of the Employers&#39; Federation of Victoria, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walpole,</inline> who went about preaching that marriage is a luxury for the workers. Along  with that statement we have to consider the evidence given in the starch case in Melbourne, the evidence given in the case of the shop employes in Sydney, and in the case of the timber combine in Western Australia, where employer after employer enunciated the doctrine that workers have no right to get married. Honorable members opposite talk of the &#34; sanctity of home life,&#34; and prate about the &#34;marriage tie.&#34; What do they do when they advertise for a couple to work on their land? Every time the advertisement finishes up with the words &#34; no encumbrances.&#34; Under such a condition, I suppose. I would be absolutely debarred from applying for a job of the kind, as I happen to have children. The doctrine enunciated by the secretary of the Employers&#39; Federation has never been repudiated by honorable members in the corner, and the man is still in the employment of the organization. </para>

                        <para>- The  president  of the Employers&#39; Federation is here to take the part of the secretary, and I can say that, when I was in correspondence with the latter, he said that he has made the remark as a joke. Even the Methodist newspaper of Victoria - and no one will accuse that publication of having any sympathy with the Labour Party - declared that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walpole</inline> had no right to say anything of the kind either in joke or in earnest. A similar doctrine was enunciated in the Sydney Ferries case, and also by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith, I believe, in Western Australia, when the timber workers there were before&#39; the Arbitration Court. The solicitor for the workers said to one of the employers, &#34; You have not allowed for women,&#34; and the reply was, &#34;We do not employ any women.&#34; &#34;What if a man be married,&#34; asked the solicitor, and the witness said, &#34; I like to sec every one married.&#34; Then the solicitor asked, &#34; Do you think a man and his wife and family can live on 30s. a week &#34; To this the employer responded, &#34; We never take them into account.&#34; Of course, marriage is not taken into account. No doubt the remarks of the honorable member for Barrier will look well in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and, as soon as a few more of the workers learn what the other side really mean, there will be further statements that will read well, not only in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> but in outside publications. I am well aware that the Tariff will be one of the chief pieces of business during this Parliament. I shall take up the attitude I took up when the Tariff was last dealt with; that is, vote for the highest possible duty on every occasion. The Government Whip, when the Tariff was last dealt with, had no need to ask how my vote was going ; but I shall vote for the highest duties only on the condition that the workers get their share of the protection. I am very sorry the honorable member for Mernda is not here, and I wonder whether he would pay any of his employes full wages on a six months&#39; holiday. I have my doubts as to whether he would. I am pleased that I had a little to do with the formation of the Starch Workers&#39; Union, and to know that they are obtaining a little better wage than they did before. A clause, placed in the Victorian Factories Act by a gentleman who is a member of this House, or by the Government of which he was a member, is known as the &#34; reputable employers &#34; clause, and it would appear that there are no &#34;reputable employers&#34; in the starch trade, seeing that they could not fix a wage. It might, therefore, be concluded that the employers are all disreputable; and, though I would not say that they are, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Hood has said so. Instead of the <inline font-style="italic">Song of the Shirt,</inline> by Tom Hood, we have now got the &#34; Song of the Starch Workers,&#34; by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Hood. The evidence showed that these workers are truly sweated, and no doubt their case will be referred to when the Tariff is under discussion, . and when, I hope, they will receive consideration. But the new protection will have to be grafted on as much as possible. I know that in a number of instances it will be impossible to give effect to the new protection, &#34;but where it is possible I shall do my utmost to have effect given to it. I am delighted that the Minister has come to this way of thinking. </para>

                        <para>- Only as the result of action by two members of the Labour Party, the honorable member for Boothby and the honorable member for Wide Bay. The honorable member for Maranoa wished to know what was to be done to protect the workers, and the Government Whip asked, &#34; Will you force the Massey-Harris Company to protect its workers,&#34; showing that his education had not proceeded as far as it has to-day. The records of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> prove that the protection given to those employed in the sugar industry is due to the efforts of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> another member of the Labour Party, who, when it was proposed to give a rebate for sugar grown bv while labour, moved the insertion of the condition that, white labour should be employed under fair conditions or the growers should not receive the rebate. A similar motion was made by a Labour representative in. regard to the spirit duties, and again in connexion with the harvester duties. The amendment moved in the last-named case was withdrawn at the request of the Minister to allow him to bring down a proposal of his own. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that it is likely that they will be required to do so. I trust that, in any proposal that is made, the Government will see that fair conditions are given to the workers. I do not think that 22s. 6d. or 25s. a week and keep, the wage paid in the sugar industry,, is a sufficiently high one for the workers in an industry which is protected by a duty of nearly 50 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- The Colonial Sugar Refining. Company takes most of it. That company is backed up by every member in the Opposition corner. Would the honorable member vote for a proposal to nationalize the sugar industry ? I have my doubts about it.. With regard to old-age pensions, it has been said that the members for New South Wales and Victoria need riot bother very much about the matter, as the old people of their States are already provided for; but I, for one, am anxious that the aged poor of other States shall also receive consideration. I trust that the Government will do something in this matter, and not treat the statement in the Governor-General &#39;.s Speech merely as a placard showing their good intentions. The honorable member for Hindmarsh spoke the other day of the tactics employed by Government candidates in Western Australia in regard to the issue of a newspaper called the <inline font-style="italic">Patriot.</inline> I have a copy of the Victorian issue of the same journal, with a picture of the Prime Minister on the title page, whereas the. Western Australian issue had a picture of the Treasurer. I regret that the Prime Minister cannot be present to-night, but that shall not deter me from criticising the Government which he leads. The last two or three pages of the Victorian <inline font-style="italic">Patriot</inline> are devoted to- an eulogy of the work of the- Deakin Administration, and to what&#39; they call an exposure of the Labour Party&#39;s - &#34; baseless claims,&#34; and of the risks which the country will run if it suffers that party to come into power. Some of the paragraphs in the Victorian <inline font-style="italic">Patriot</inline> do not appear in the Western Australian issue, because in Western Australia the Government were supporting free-traders; while here they had to be whole-hog protectionists, lest the Labour candidates should, go further than they. This is one of the paragraphs to which. I refer - </para>

                        Members of the Labour Party are so constantly making incorrect statements as to the work of that party, that it has become absolutely necessary to set out the real facts. By way of preliminary, let it be remembered that the House of Representatives consists of 75 members. No Federal proposition can become law unless this House approves of it. In the first Parliament the House was divided as follows : - Protectionists and supporters of the Ministry, 33 ; free-traders and supporters of the Opposition, 23 ; Labour members, 16 ; the  Speaker,  1 ; total, 75. Clearly 33 members could do touch more than 16; but it is equally clear that unless the 33 Ministerialists amalgamated with, or obtained the support of, some other party they could not carry anything. The same condition. necessarily obtained with respect to either the Free-traders or the Labour Party.

                <para class="block">The statements in this newspaper were brought up to date so far as the Acts passed by the Ministry were concerned. Why then was not correct information given in regard to the numerical strength of parties at the time the <inline font-style="italic">Patriot</inline> was issued? The Labour Party in the last Parliament numbered twenty-five, and now numbers twenty-six, and we hope that it will be larger in the next Parliament. But probably if this Ministry is in office at the next elections it will keep on using the figures  applying  to the first Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; but surely such conduct is nut honest. The Labour Party numbered more than the Ministerial Party last Parliament, and why have not the Ministerialists the manliness to admit it? We have been asked why we do not get rid of the Government, if we so much object to it? As the honorable member for Hindmarsh has said, while we dislike the present Ministry, we hate the Opposition still more. We think that we should get less from them, because they are less democratic. A number of honorable members contend that the Tariff should be got out of the way so that the Labour Party may be attacked, and put in its proper place as the Opposition. I do not mind how soon that comes about. We shall then have a clear line of cleavage &#39;between parties. If the Labour Party had never entered this House; apparently the only thing for parties to quarrel about would be the possession of the Treasury benches, and we should have had continual combinations to displace the existing Government, as in the earlier political history of Victoria and the other States.

                    <para>It will thus be seen that no party by itself carried anything in the Federal Parliament, notwithstanding the repeated assertions of the Labour Party to the contrary. The next point of interest, therefore, is : &#34; Who initiated the measures that were passed, and for which such great credit has been taken by the party to which attention is called.&#34; The answer is that every single measure was promulgated, introduced, and carried on the initiative of the Liberal Protectionist Party, and not one Of them was suggested or approved on the motion of the Labour Party. </para>

                <para class="block">That is absolutely false. The minimum wage provision in the Public Service Act was carried on the motion of a member of the Labour Party, and, as I have shown, the new protection was initiated in the same way. When the Australian Industries Preservation Bill, or the Anti-Trust Bill, as it was better known, was before us, an amendment providing that the workers should receive something like fair conditions was moved by the Labour member for Perth. Where then is the truth of the statement that the Government have done everything and the Labour Party nothing? </para>

                        <para>- Yes, and no doubt when the honorable member speaks he will point out where they are. Perhaps he will be able to say what particular colour they are. The article to which I was referring declares that not one measure owes its enactment to the efforts of the Labour Party. That statement is absolutely false. This paper is not registered for transmission through the post, but I believe that many of these newspapers passed through the post. Almost every- honorable member who was opposed by a Ministerialist would know whether they were circulated. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. In a letter which I had occasion to write to the press of this city during the recent campaign I pointed out that the Labour Party were bearing the brunt of the fight against the free-trade reactionaries in New South Wales. The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> was careful to eliminate that statement, because it did not accord with its own book. But everybody is aware that within a radius of 100 miles of Sydney not a Ministerial candidate offered himself. </para>

                        <para>- I wish now to say a word or two upon the hostility of the Victorian press to the Labour Party. It is well known that both the free-trade and protectionist organs of this city are opposed to us. The <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> while supporting Ministerialists in some cases, advocated the candidature of honorable members who occupy seats in the Opposition corner. After the Ministry had selected their candidates for the Senate, that journal urged the claims&#34; of only one of them and of two others who had been selected by the <inline font-style="italic">Argus.</inline> It has frequently been asserted that the Labour Party is losing strength. In answer to that charge, I would point out that, in Victoria, the leading Labour candidate for the Senate polled 131,500 votes, as against 116,000 polled by the leading  Ministeralist.  I quite understand that some honorable members will say that that was due to the fact that the Labour candidate received a certain sectarian support. But if he did so, the Ministerial candidate was upon precisely the same ticket. Our candidate polled 16,000 votes more than did his opponent&#39;, although he did not have the advantage of having his claims advocated by the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> and at least half the papers of the State. Our second candidate polled 131,071 votes, as against 87,000 registered on behalf of the Ministerialist, and our third candidate polled 83,000 votes, as against 37,000 recorded for the lowest Ministerial candidate. What, then, becomes of the jibe that the Labour Party is going back? I desire now to show the absolutely unfair attitude which was taken up by the press of Victoria towards the Labour candidates. I have here a diagram showing the quantity of space which was given to reports of my own speeches by the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper, and that  which was devoted to those delivered by my opponent. The latter received five columns, whereas I received approximately a quarter of a column. I object to a newspaper which professes to be fair adopting such tactics. Further, it is well known to every one who has contested an election that when a candidate advertises a meeting it is the custom for the newspaper in which the advertisement appears, to notify at the  foot of the election notices that the meeting is to be held. I have in my possession copies of the whole of the electioneering advertisements which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> upon two dates, and from these it will be seen that every candidate, with the exception of myself, was given the benefit of the notification to which I have referred. To single me out for such unfair treatment is playing it very low down. </para>

                        <para>- Both morning newspapers were opposed to me, but I happened to be contesting a small electorate, and consequently I was able to get round it, and overtake some of the misstatements which had been made by my opponents. I hold in my hand a sectarian &#34;dodger&#34; which was issued during the late election, and which I had intended to read to the House. However, I do not propose to do so now. It was issued by a certain sectarian organization in this city with a view to damaging my candidature. Not only so, but it was actually distributed at the church doors upon a Sunday. A copy of it was given to my wife upon leaving that building. </para>

                        <para>- It was playing it lower down than I shall ever play it to obtain a seat in this Parliament. What would be said of the Labour Party if it dared to attend the churches and distribute its literature? Further, I happened to be a member of this particular church, and I know that the authors of this &#34; dodger &#34; actually asked for permission to place it in the pews of the building. Rather than resort to such discreditable tactics, I would prefer to retire from public life. In the&#39; division of Balaclava, it will be recollected, a dispute arose as to who should be selected as the Conservative candidate. It is a singular circumstance that, whilst our opponents were telling the workers in my electorate and in the division of Batman that they were to be divided upon the question of religion, the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of the 5th of December last should have suggested that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nicholas</inline> Fitzgerald, M.L.C., <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mccutcheon,</inline> M.L.A., and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. N.</inline> Levi, ex- M.L.C., should be appointed arbitrators to settle the dispute. Now, it is well known thai- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fitzgerald</inline> is a co-religionist of Archbishop Carr, and, I believe, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCutcheon</inline> is a member of the Methodist Church.

Nevertheless, a report of three-quarters of a column appeared concerning the meeting which was not held, but not a line was published in reference to the meeting which was held. </para>

                        <para>- Is he? I suppose that is why he selected a member sitting in the Opposition corner to attend to the interests of his constituency while he is absent. When one of the witnesses in the starch case to whom I have referred was under cross-examination regarding the value of certain articles, she was asked, &#34; How much was the cloak which you are wearing.&#34;  Her  reply was, &#34; It is not mine; I borrowed it.&#34; I suppose that some of the raiment in which certain individuals are attired has been stolen from the workers. We have been assured on previous occasions that honorable members have no right to refer -to Tasmania ia..connexion with the need for factory legislation. The honorable member for Franklin has repeatedly declared that everything was as it should be in the State which he represents. But I learn from the report of the Commission which has been inquiring into these matters, that in the brick kilns of Tasmania the men work from seventy-seven to ninety-one hours per week, and that the wages of females employed in the clothing factories range from  10s.  to us. per week. In one instance, the girls were taken on as learners, and during the first six months were required to work for nothing. Yet the honorable member for Capricornia yesterday had the effrontery to contemptuously sneer at certain remarks emanating from this side of the Chamber by saying that they would read well in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> They will read well in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> because they are true. The existing state of things cannot, continue very much longer. I venture to think that in a very little time the Labour Party will be in a &#39;majority not only in this House, but in every State throughout the Commonwealth. In the coffee palaces of Tasmania, girls are receiving from 8s. to 15s. per week, kitchenmen from 14s. to 20s., and second cooks 20s. Similarly, clerks are in receipt of from 10s. to 12s. per week. In every branch of industry in that State the prevailing rate of wages has been proved to be too low. There is not a State in the union in which we cannot find many industries in which the workers are underpaid. We know that even in the division of Capricornia the operatives in the cane fields are only to receive 22s. 6d. per week under the contracts which the Colonial Sugar Refining Company wish them to sign. </para>

                        <para>- I should like to see some honorable members opposite trying to live on such a wage. Some of them spend more in a single &#34; shout&#34; than they are prepared to pay to many of their workers for a full week&#39;s wage. Another matter to which I desire to refer is the cry raised so often and repeated again and again, notwithstanding repeated denials and resolutions carried by labour conferences, that the Labour Party is not sound on the question of &#39;the marriage tie. It is said also that if we had our way we would destroy the sanctity of religion. Can it be said that we have ever ignored the sanctity of the Sabbath, as some of our opponents have done, by distributing electioneering bills at the doors of churches ? That has been done by my opponents in the electorate which I represent. Recently a very interesting case, arising out of <inline font-style="italic">st</inline> dispute in connexion with the election for Balaclava, was tried in the Victorian courts, when evidence was given that paid* agitators were employed by the Australian Women&#39;s National League. I may sa&#62;&#62; in passing, that one of these women some weeks ago was fined &#163;5, with &#163;5 costs, for breaking the electoral law at Geelong. At. the trial of the case to which I have referred, one of these paid organizers stated in evidence that&#39; she was receiving &#163;30 or &#163;40 a month from the league. </para>

                        <para>- I think that some of them received far more than they were worth. Those who paid the money did not receive good value, so far as the political return was concerned. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chomley</inline> also gave evidence that he received .&#163;40- a month for organizing work done by him, on behalf of the Citizens&#39; League. I should like to know whether the expenses of these organizations have been included in the electoral accounts submitted by any candidate at the last general election. If the provisions of the Electoral Act in regard to the expenses of candidates are to be broken in this way by organizers - if we are to have at work organizers such- as those who have been operating in the electorate of Echuca recently - the law will become a dead letter. We must have an amendment of the Act so as to absolutely prohibit organizations from spending money in advertising candidates. I have before me three advertisements - taken from the Age, the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Herald,</inline> respectively, and published under the heading of &#34; Election Notices &#34; during the last election campaign. The Act provides that no election notice shall be published unless it contains the name and address of the person authorizing it ; but as a matter of fact, not one of these advertisements gives the name and address of the person responsible for it. I should like to know what action the Electoral Department intends to take in order to compel these newspapers to give the names ,of the persons who sent in these advertisements for publication. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hewison,</inline> who claimed that he was one of the founders of the Women&#39;sNational League, said, in the course of a . speech delivered at Brighton, during the election campaign - </para>

But then the league got an organizer who changed the whole tone of the league&#39;s political work, and instead of arguing against Socialism on industrial and economic grounds it was made an assertion by the league  against the Labour Party that they sought to Upset the marriage tie and religion. He contended at the time, with emphasis, that the Labour Party&#39;s platform did not necessarily involve that conclusion, and his opinion was endorsed by leading writers. At a meeting of the league he said the making of that assertion against the Labour Party was a mistake, and that it was impolitic. Frankly, he told the league that the allegation was extreme, and that, if it were persisted in, no matter how strong the league&#39;s other arguments were against the Labour Party, the league  would  not be so successful against the party as it might be otherwise. After that statement, he was asked to see Janet Lady Clarke. She said &#34; We think this a good  move,  this cry, and we think we ought to stick to it. - </para>

                        <para>- She is the  President  of the Australian Women&#39;s National League. The vice-president was recently fined <inline font-style="italic">-&#163;5</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline> costs for a breach of &#39;the Electoral Act. All the offenders in this respect have not yet been caught, but at the next general election we hope to obtain evidence against others. I have always advocated the extension of the franchise to women, and have no objection to <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Clarke,</inline> or any other woman, exercising Tier right to vote; but, to my mind, a woman lowers her sex when she takes up the attitude that it is unnecessary to consider the truth of an assertion; and that the only consideration is whether or not the making of it is a good move. Those who have been responsible for this cry against the Labour Party know that there is not a particle of truth in it. It has been admitted by the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> that the home life of the Labour Party is just as good as is the home life of any of the Opposition. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that it is. At many of my &#34; election meetings I certainly did not put it so mildly. What I did say was that if some of the statements that I had heard were true, I could not say that the home life of many of our opponents was as good as our own. And yet these honorable members have the audacity to lecture us on the question of morals, and to say that our party believes in the breaking-down of the marriage tie ! I did not intend to speak at such length, and I shall conclude by expressing the hope that when we deal with the Tariff we shall see that every one connected with our industries - the workers engaged in them and those who consume that which they produce - receive a fair deal. I hope also that we shall sq amend the Electoral <inline font-style="italic">rAct</inline> as to prevent &#39;the issue of papers such as have been circulated in Victoria and in other States, advocating the claims of certain candidates. These publications cannot be described as newspapers, and yet the cost of issuing them does not appear in the accounts of any candidate. I trust that we shall. likewise prohibit the introduction of paid organizers in the conduct of elections, and prevent the publication of pamphlets by the Employers&#39; Federation and others.  a3  a matter of fact, the Employers&#39; Federation distributed twenty or thirty different leaflets in my electorate. Men were sent to my meetings to distribute them, and I told my friends to secure as many as they could, for it was good business to do so. I trust they will make an effort to distribute more. We sadly need education, but the education which the workers will receive in the near future will be such as to place them on a higher plane than they have ever previously occupied. </para>

                    <para>.- It was not my  intention to take part in this debate, and I have to apologize for addressing the House without making any preparation. But when I saw this morning that the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> was making another attempt to dragoon honorable members - to stop their mouths, declaring that there ought to be no opportunity for us to speak to a motion  for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply - I determined to speak. I recognise that it is the province of the press to comment upon the political opinions of honorable members in such manner as is thought necessary in the public interest. I have always expected, and trust that I shall always be subject to criticism; but it is idle to say that one of the most important privileges that we possess should be curtailed. I do not advocate any abuse of that privilege, but the suggestion that our right in this respect should be curtailed is against reason, and I am sure will be resented by most honorable members.- So far as I am aware, the procedure of the House affords honorable members no other equal opportunity to canvass the work cf a Ministry during recess, nor do I know of any other opportunity open to honorable members to place before Ministers their views with respect to the various subjects for legislation outlined in the Governor-General&#39;s Speech. We have had during this debate several most illuminating speeches. For instance, the honorable member for Barrier enlightened, not only the House, but the whole community, as to the attitude of the Labour Party towards the Ministry. The honor able member for Yarra, who has just resumed his seat, has also thrown a light on the present situation. If the debate has served no other object, it has at least been informative in the sense that it has enabled the House to ascertain what are the relations existing between that strong party in the Ministerial corner and the occupants of the Treasury benches. I have been returned to this House with an anxious desire to secure the passing of such legislation as is designed to serve the best interests of the community. I decline to admit that my honorable friends of the Labour Party have the right to arrogate to themselves the exclusive privilege of conserving the workers&#39; interests. </para>

                        <para>- If so, we are a caucus without a distinctive leader or pledge, and with only the one common desire - though we do not claim that that is our exclusive privilege - to do what we believe right in the interests of the whole community without exception. My great grievance against the Labour Party is that they work for an exclusive class ; and I repeat that they are not justified in arrogating to themselves the whole desire and the power to see that class benefited. I should like to say a word or two about the present position, which has been criticised so  strongly  by those who have already spoken, and will, no doubt, be referred to in terms quite as  strong  by others to follow. Surely my honorable friends in the Ministry must see  the humiliating position in which they are placed at the present time by adverse criticism. </para>

                        <para>- Some honorable members fatten under it. I have no authority to speak in a collective capacity on behalf of the honorable members who immediately surround me, but I think I am justified in saying for the whole of them that they are here to support even the Labour Party if the latter bring forward measures for the common good. I have repeatedly said that I do not care who occupy the Treasury benches, so long as solid, and just, and equitable legislation is introduced, and soundly administered. I hope the time is not far distant when there will be a distinct cleavage between those honorable members who are free, and those who are not free - between- those under a distinct and definite pledge, from which they cannot depart, and those who have the right to exercise individual judgment in the discussion of the measures introduced. </para>

                        <para>- I am pledged to my constituents, but I am subject to no caucus rule. As to the Prime Minister, I say with all sincerity of him, as my personal friend, that it is to be deeply regretted that so distinguished and able a man should be at the present time laid aside. It is the desire of every one of us that he should take a  sufficiently  long rest to enable him to come back completely restored to health, and also, I think, that there should be no effort or attempt at any action during his absence which would remove his Government. Once or twice an opinion has been expressed which I do not share, that the Prime Minister on his visit to Great Britain did not accomplish all he desired, and an effort has been made to underrate the work he did. It is true that he did not bring about what was the ostensible object of his visit, namely, preferential trade. We were told the other day, in an able address, that the Prime Minister had gone to England and taken up an attitude against the will of the whole of the people at Home, who had declared strongly against preferential trade. I hope, however, that eventually a satisfactory arrangement will be made by which we may secure preference within the Empire - a preference which, I think, could be scientifically adjusted. No doubt preferential trade will mean sacrifice on the part of both Great Britain and Australia - there must be mutual concessions. Notwithstanding, the startling figures we have heard, showing the enormous prosperity of Great Britain, and notwithstanding the fact that British trade exceeds the trade of the three great nations of France, Germany and the United States of America, these latter are making proportionately gigantic strides, and we must be prepared to meet the situation. . Under the circumstances, therefore, I hope that a just arrangement for preferential trade within the Empire may be brought about. In my opinion, the Prime Minister, during his visit to England, raised the status of Australia. He occupied a high platform, and his great eloquence provided a valuable advertisement for this country. The position and conditions of Australia secured a prominent consideration which they had never before received in quarters which he was able, by his eloquence, to approach and attack ; and, if there were no other result, he, assisted by the Minister of Trade and Customs in that gentleman&#39;s own  way, succeeded in raising our status in the opinion of the people at Home. The Minister of Trade and Customs, with that marvellous faculty of his, secured a position in the </para>

I desire to say that I am utterly opposed to the proposals of the Government in relation to the transfer of the Northern Territory; and I take this opportunity to make my position clear. In my opinion, the only way in which we can deal effectually with this question is to establish a new tropical State, including the whole of the northern area. I cannot suppose that it would be possible for the Commonwealth Ministry to administer this large Territory with satisfactory results. And now, as one of the members of the Navigation Commission, I wish to protest against the proposal made in the Senate to introduce at once a Navigation Bill. Other members of the Navigation Commission occupy seats in both Houses; and I contend that the contemplated action is an insult to us. The Commission had a Bill remitted to it, and with the concurrence of the Minister, after a report had been made, it was held over until the Conference in London had dealt, with the matter. This Navigation Bill, ought to be remitted to the Royal Commission, which has not yet been dissolved. </para>

                        <para>- Turning to another matter, it seems to me that the Government should seriously consider its position, in view of the humiliating criticism of the Labour Party. It is not for me to say what Ministers should do, but the leader of the Opposition has, in the most generous way, and of settled purpose, offered to stand aside, and, indeed, to leave public life, if the proper Constitutional arrangement of parties can thereby be secured. With regard to the mail contract, the Ministry was very adroit in cancelling it before meeting Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister was enlightened in London as to the machinations of the syndicate. We, on this side, said that we regarded the terms of the contract as excellent if they could be secured. But we did not think that they would be secured, and our convictions have, unfortunately, been verified. I have read the conditions of tender for the new contract, and I am afraid that another mistake is about to be made. What is &#163;50,000 or &#163;100,000 to capitalists who have the command of immense sums of money, and are able to give orders to ship builders? A clear distinction should be drawn between tenderers who possess large fleets, or have a large amount of capital invested in shipping, and mere speculative builders such as the syndicate concerned in the cancelled contract. I admit that it is difficult to make a distinction, but it should be made, though the Government has done nothing in that direction. In conclusion, I would, say that, in my opinion, honorable members should not forego their right to comment on the programme, policy, and administration of the Government, and the debate on the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply is the only opportunity for effectual criticism of that kind. </para>

                <para class="block">I am a free-trader, not through force of circumstances, but from conviction. I cannot see how protection will benefit the workers, particularly those of Western Queensland. Everything they eat, drink, wear, and use is imported, and what they produce has to be exported for sale in the markets of the world at whatever price it will bring. Therefore, I hope that the Government, whatever its proposals, will not overlook: the necessity of making conditions equitable. No doubt the decision of the constituencies has been for protection. The honorable member for Yarra has told us that he would vote for the enforcement of prohibitive duties. I would gladly do so too, because that would bring- about direct taxation, which is one of the planks of the Labour Party. But what would the States then do for revenue? Some honorable members-have told me that the Tariff could? be both prohibitive and revenue producing, and when I questioned one of them on the subject, he said that he would impose prohibitive duties in regard to articles which could be manufactured in Australia, and revenue duties on articles which we are forced to import. The Minister of Trade and Customs recently stated that we should&#34; make everything we require in Australia, and export the surplus. Does he think that ships will come here empty, in order to take away our exports? And does he propose to build a ring fence around Australia, and make us absolutely self-contained ? </para>

I am ready to give protection to the workers, but I shall fight, if necessary, for twelve months at a stretch against any proposal to tax articles which cannot be manufactured within the Commonwealth. I shall not sacrifice my principles because they are opposed to those of the majority. I come from a fighting stock. The Labour Party has had to fight its way up from the very bottom against adverse circumstances. No doubt this fighting has put us in fair trim to do the work of the Opposition. The leader of the Opposition says that he is willing to sacrifice himself in order to bring about constitutional government, when there will be only two parties in the House, one for the masses, and the other for the classes. The sooner that comes about the better I shall be pleased.&#39; I should be glad to go into Opposition to-morrow, and would do so but for the fact that, like <inline font-style="italic">a.</inline> good democrat, I have to obey the will of the majority. </para>

                <para>Some such promise as this has been made to every Parliament since Federation was inaugurated. When the leader of the Opposition was in power a Commission was appointed to inquire into the old-age pensions question. The present Postmaster-General was its  chairman.  That Commission visited and took evidence in each of the States, and reported that a Commonwealth old-age pension system was necessary, and should be provided as soon as possible. But the Cabinet of which the honorable gentleman is a member has done nothing to give effect to that report. If the Treasurer had his way, the providing of old-age pensions would be made impossible for ten years after 19 10, because he wishes, in effect, to extend the operation of the Braddon provision by a .decade. Why has the Government put old-age pensions on its programme? In my opinion, the reference in the Governor-General&#39;s Speech is merely a shop-window decoration, and Ministers have no intention of carrying this promise into effect. Why does not the Postmaster-General say candidly and plainly that the Government cannot provide for a Commonwealth old-age pension system? I am ashamed to have to continually tell my constituents, while nothing is being done to bring it into existence, that I am in favour of a Commonwealth old-age pension system. The old people of my constituency look to me to do something for them, because the Queensland Government gives married couples who have reached the age of sixty or sixty-five, and are incapacitated, only 7s. 6d. per week. How can two persons live on such an allowance? It is pauperizing and degrading to treat people in that way. This Parliament has affirmed the system of old-age pensions. Even the most conservative members of the first Commonwealth Parliament affirmed that the adoption of a Federal system of old-age pensions was imperative. Yet we are as far off the realization of any such scheme as we ever were. The Government can find money for the purpose of sending a High Commissioner to England - thus greasing the fat sow - or for the purpose of taking over the Northern Territory from South Australia, but they cannot provide funds for old-age pensions. In passing, I wish to say that if I were offered the whole of the Northern Territory for nothing I would say &#34;Keep it, I do not want it.&#34; Upon one occasion I travelled overland from Longreach to Oodnadatta, and I may tell honorable members that the solitude very nearly drove my two companions and myself mad. There was not a bird to chirrup in the bush, there was not a fish in the water, and in nine cases out of every ten the water was so salt as to be undrinkable. Every night that we camped the solitude made us wish that we were back in civilization. No vote of mine will ever be recorded in favour of taking over that Territory. Need I remind honorable members that Camooweal, in Queensland, is within sixteen miles of the South Australian border, and that there are pastoral stations in and around it. If the Territory were such good country as is reported, would not the squatters of Queensland have crossed the border long ago? Yet in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of this morning I read an article strongly recommending small settlers to go to the Territory and&#39; engage in &#34;mixed&#34; farming. I do not know what is meant by &#34;mixed&#34; farming, but I do say that the farmer who goes there- will become &#34; mixed &#34; very quickly. The Speech of the Governor-General states - </para>

                <para class="block">I wish to ask the Minister of Defence whether anything has yet been done to prevent officers who have been sent abroad to obtain instruction at the expense of the Commonwealth - particularly to Canada and India - from accepting more lucrative positions under other Governments? After we have expended a large sum of money to render officers efficient, it frequently happens that they quit the Commonwealth service. I have in my mind one officer in particular who was sent to the old country. I refer to Lieutenant Innes. He passed through his period of training there, and was returning by way of Canada. The Canadian authorities saw that he was a smart officer, and accordingly offered him a better position. He at once&#39; sent in his resignation and accepted the offer of the Canadian authorities. As a result we not only lost his valuable services, but also the money which we had expended upon his training. Something should be done to prevent a repetition of that sort of thing. I recognise that it is a wise step for the Commonwealth to send officers to be trained abroad, particularly in India, where they have to perform frontier service, which is almost equivalent to active service, and where they naturally become thoroughly efficient. I commend the Government for proposing to increase the number of officers to be sent abroad for instructional purposes. But I do not think it is officers who are near the age of retirement who should be selected for this training; they should be young men who have displayed marked ability. With regard to the proposed establishment of a factory for the production of munitions of war and small arms, I wish to say that ever since the Federation was established the same promise has been made. I. wish to know from the Minister whether he is still shuffling. -Only the other day I directed his attention to a paragraph in the newspapers stating that Brigadier-General Gordon was coming from New South Wales to give him valuable information as to the establishment of such a factory. But I learned from an interview which the Minister has since had with a representative of the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> that he does not propose to take any. notice of the information imparted to him by the Commandant of New South Wales until certain officers return from the mother country. </para>

                <para>Mi. PAGE. - I now come to the question of the mail contract. I do not flatter myself that I am a business man, but I know how to make a &#34; quid &#34; when I see one lying about. From the very first day that this contract was made I was led to exclaim, : What is the meaning of this?&#34; Having, had some experience in Queensland, of that  smellful  business known as company promoting, I saw that the trail of the company promoter was .over it all. Consequently I was led to ask myself, &#34; How  much  are these fellows to get out of it?&#34; Everything has turned out just as I predicted. The contract has been nothing more nor less than a big company swindle, and the Government are to blame for not having recognised it long ago. Only yesterday the honorable member for Barrier during the course of his speech was prompted to inquire,. &#34; What would have happened if the Labour Party had been in power, and had made, such a muddle?&#34; I know what would have happened. We should have had the Treasurer going from one end of the Commonwealth to the other and bellowing like a. bull, &#34; These are the business men who cannot even run a mail contract.&#34; What I maintain is that if we are going to make a contract wholly and solely for the carrying of mails, honorable members ought to assist the Queensland representatives in securing justice for that State. Queensland happens to be the :State that is most inconveniently situated when the vessels come  to Australia <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Fremantle and Adelaide. The consequence is that Brisbane is left out altogether, so far as the provision of refrigerating space is concerned ; and refrigerating space on the mail steamers is as important to the industrial life of this country to-day as is the carriage of letters to its business life. I maintain therefore that in any contract made by the Federal Government provision should be made for refrigerating space, and that a share of that space should be reserved for the northern State. There is no reason why Queensland should be  compelled to pay &#163;26,000 over and above her share of the subsidy  -&#163;i6,ooo -  in order to induce mail steamers to call at Brisbane. When the time comes for the acceptance of tenders, I therefore hope that not only the Victorian members will be with us in seeing that we get our due, but that the New South Wales members also will assist us. Otherwise, I shall consider that Queensland is shamefully treated. Paragraph 16 of the Governor-General&#39;s Speech reads as follows : - </para>

                    <para>I am happy to state that the last year was one of great prosperity throughout the Commonwealth.

                <para>Now I want to ask honorable members in all sincerity - why do we want to interfere with the Tariff at all, and to increase the taxation of the masses of the people when such words as those are put into the Governor-General&#39;s mouth? Victoria was never in such a prosperous condition as she has been during the last twelve months. Why do not honorable members let well alone? We were fold before the last general election that Victorian industries were starving, and that her manufacturers and workers were crying out for relief through the Tariff. The present Government was returned to power, and since then we have been informed that the industries which were starving have been placed on a firm and solid basis. What need is there to interfere with the Tariff when the industries of the country are in such a flourishing condition? My own opinion is that the Government does not want to go on with Tariff revision at all. Another little matter to which I wish to refer relates to Socialism. Honorable members opposite need not be afraid. I will give them what I have to say in small doses, so that they can swallow it easily. A little while ago there was published in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> a report of a speech delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swinburne</inline> at a farmers&#39; conference. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swinburne</inline> made use of the following observation: - </para>

                    <para>The farmer was a great Socialist, and demanded that the Government should be socialistic so far as he was concerned. . . . They were compelled, at the farmers&#39; instance, to inquire into new crops and seeds, secure new markets, take a hand in arranging freights for transport, and make good roads. It was astonishing to see to what extent the Government had to take part in the organization and the union of farmers. Organization was almost focussed in the Government. </para>

If that is the only thing they have to say in regard to Socialism, then we can stand that every time. All I ask them to do is to give us a square deal.

                        <para>- I was there on official business. But joking aside, I am satisfied that our party is strong enough to stand that sort of criticism,, and that instead of doing us any harm, it will do us good. I hope that when the Tariff is brought forward, some of the free-trade members will not funk, but will show the same solid front when they see an attempt made to impose upon the masses duties which are unfair and unjust, as was shown here on a former occasion. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not propose to speak at any length, but as an old member of the State Parliament, and a new member of this House, I could not allow the debate to close without expressing some of the opinions I hold in regard to the matters referred to in the Governor-General&#39;s Speech and other matters which are not contained therein. I agree with other speakers that the </para>

                <para class="block">Address-in-Reply is a parliamentary form which ought to commend itself to every one concerned. In the first place, it affords an opportunity to every member of a new House to become acquainted with his peers. It also affords an opportunity to an honorable member to confirm his platform utterances. And it is an opportunity which has been availed of freely for passing liberal criticism on a Government which I think was entitled to receive that criticism. The honorable member for Maranoa alluded to paragraph 16 of the GovernorGeneral&#39;s Speech. I expected that he would touch upon the financial question, but he did not. A Treasurer who bases his estimates on years of plenty will in all probability have to take a pull when the plenteous time has passed away. I, as a business man, feel that, however great our nation is going to be, however plentiful money is to-day, the time will inevitably come when the word &#34;caution&#34; will have to be written, and we shall have to go slowly. What are the proposals which are in the air? I do not think that in any of the debates during the last six years the members of this House have questioned the financial position. It was never anticipated, I think, that the House would attempt to trench upon the privileges of the States in their financial arrangements. It was never contemplated, in my opinion, that the House, at any rate during the first ten years of its existence, should exceed the annual expenditure which, under considerable difficulties, was agreed upon at the Federal Convention. But what do we find? From the returns presented to the last Parliament, we find that the expenditure has increased from _&#163;3, 900,000 to ,&#163;5,020,000. I venture to say that when the Treasurer brings down his Estimates they will show a still further increase. I ask honorable members to recognise what, is in the air. First there is a proposal to take over the Northern Territory. The honorable member for Brisbane out the case well the other night when he pointed out that it would involve an expenditure of about &#163;11,000,000. Next there is a proposal to establish a Capital in the bush. How many more millions will that involve ? Then we have a proposal to construct a transcontinental railway, and a number of other proposals are in the air. I am afraid that unless the people take a pull during the term of this Parliament - and in mv opinion it will have to be taken - then when the year 19.10 comes round, a serious position will have been readied. We shall have trenched upon the 75 per cent. of the Customs and Excise revenue, and what will became of the State revenues and the State requirements? It is true that we represent the Federal citizen, but it must be remembered that we also represent the State citizen, that he, at any rate, is represented by the State Parliament, and that it is not retrenching. The Commonwealth took over three Departments from the States, and one would have expected that there would have been a determination on their part to retrench, but to-day - dealing with Victoria only - the expenditure reaches something like &#163;8,500,000. That is altogether too much. It was never contemplated that a great expenditure should go on &#39; under the State Government in addition to that under the Commonwealth Government. It was never intended that the Commonwealth should authorize expenditure to the extent which it has done. Some honorable members have spoken about direct taxation. In my opinion, we do not want direct taxation. There ought to be no necessity for its imposition. Our population is limited, and a system which would bring in more people would be acceptable to everybody. I desire to say a few words regarding the Naval Agreement. I understood that, when the Prime Minister and the Minister of Trade and Customs went to London to attend the Imperial Conference, they carried no authority to pledge this country to anything, and yet I find that the Naval Agreement is to be broken. For what purpose? </para>

                        <para>- No; I believe that if the electors were appealed to they would say at once that a better agreement - I am not going to deal with the amount of the subsidy, which, perhaps, is too little - could not be made. At any rate, Great Britain has never shown a desire to hurt those with whom she has been associated. In all her transactions with a beaten foe she has always shown that magnanimity for which our nation is proverbial ; and if she has shown that same magnanimity to us as regards the slight charge she has made for defending us, then all honour to her. I believe that if the matter is debated in the House - and, no doubt, it will be - there will be an overwhelming majority in favour of the Naval Agreement. What are we getting for our subsidy? I think that we are getting even more than the honorable member for Wentworth said, when he put the case very clearly in a morning newspaper some time ago. We have the protection, not only of the Australian Squadron, but of the British Fleet on the China station, and it is from that quarter that it is said we may expect trouble. In my opinion, however, we are not likely to have any trouble. It is nonsense to talk about this country building up a Navy, but even if we attempted to do so we should need some (protection in the meantime. I suppose that honorable members are aware that the building of a high-class cruiser must involve a very large expenditure of time and money. The cost of such a vessel would be something Like&#163;1,500,000, and its construction would occupy from two and a half to three years. It is idle for us to play at being a nation. I have no doubt that some system by which we could protect our coasts and assist the British Navy in time of trouble would be acceptable and proper ; but how many ships can we build ? What money have we available for such a purpose? There is a very old song that used to be sung by Britishers - </para>

                        <para>- That is so. We all were delighted with the reception given by the people of Great Britain to our representatives at the Imperial Conference. The outstanding feature of that Conference was the loyalty evidenced by General Botha to the British flag, and even if the gathering had no other result, the great sentiment of loyalty which permeated it would fully justify it. There are many other matters with which I should like to deal, but I take it that other opportunities for their discussion must necessarily occur. I do not wish at this late hour to inflict a lengthy speech upon the House. I thank honorable members for their kindly attention to the few words I have said, and sincerely hope that however we may differ on political questions, that <inline font-style="italic">camaraderie</inline> which is one of the best features of a Parliament will be evidenced, not only by myself and my <inline font-style="italic">confreres</inline> on this side, but by honorable members generally. </para>
