As his reply was very unsatisfactory, I repeat my question. I ask if he can say definitely whether Brisbane is to be a port of call ? </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member seems to forget that we have to consider other matters besides that to which he has drawn attention, and as no contract can be made until there is agreement as to every detail, no information can be given about any proposed condition until all have been settled. The honorable member, as a business man, must realize that we have no other course than to decline to give information until the agreement is complete. If I could, without impairing the interests of the Commonwealth, I would do so. </para>

The rates of duties upon manufactured products will, to some extent, depend on whether there is a duty on raw material. I suggest to the Minister that the matter might be considered. </para>

In any case, the same amount of time will be occupied. If I have the Bill ready, as I think I shall, it will probably be introduced before we commence the consideration of Division VI. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to say a few words in connexion with the unsatisfactory administration of the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act.. Some time ago I supplied the Minister of Trade and Customs with definite information concerning certain firms who were evading the law. The existing condition of things is causing the greatest dissatisfaction amongst employers and employes in South Australia. They feel dissatisfied with the action of myself and my colleagues, because they imagine that we are not discharging our duty in seeing that the law is administered. I do not wish to be a party to any legislation which is not to be made operative. We ought not to be always "fooling" the workers. </para>

                            <para>- But that apparently is what has been done in regard to the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act. A long time ago I told the Minister that the firm of Messrs. Brebner and Keefe are not obeying the law, and that they had informed their employés that they did not intend to obey it. They are working their employés fifty-six hours a week, and yet not a single step has been taken to enable this House, and the public, to ascertain whether or not the Act itself is defective. Only the other day I credited Messrs. Hawke and Company, of Kapunda, with having faithfully observed the law, but I am now in possession of information to the effect that they are doing nothing of the kind. From the answers which I have received from time to time, it is evident that the Government imagine that they have no power to proceed against firms who have been exempted from the payment of Excise. But I would point out that they are only exempted conditionally upon their carrying out the terms of the award of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. Those terms were agreed to by both the employers and employés, and firms which fail to comply with them render themselves liable for the payment of Excise. It seems to me to be simplicity itself for the Minister to deal with such firms. If an excessive duty is levied upon any article which is imported the importer has no option but to pay that duty under protest. Why has not a similar provision been applied to those manufacturers of agricultural machinery who are disobeying the law? </para>

                            <para>- The standard is fixed by the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> O'Connor has declared that, provided manufacturers adhere to the terms of his award, they are to be exempted from the payment of Excise. But those terms have not been observed by quite a number of firms in South Australia, and yet no real effort has been made by the Government to ascertain whether or not the revenue of the country is being protected. Surely it is easy for the Minister to say to Messrs. Bagshaw and Sons, or Messrs. Hawke and Company, or Messrs. May and Company, " We are going to charge you Excise on the agricultural implements which you have manufactured." It would then be for those firms to say, "We are not liable to pay any Excise." The Department would then be in a position to see that the revenue was protected. If the employers supplied false information to the Department the employes would be able to come forward and tell the Department that it had been misled. It is due to the House, to the manufacturers of agricultural machinery throughout the Commonwealth, and to their employes, that they should know whether the Department intends to carry out the provisions of the Act so that all may be placed on an equal footing. If I were an employer, I certainly should not continue to pay fair wages if my competitor across the street were permitted to pay unfair wages, and to take away my trade. I am surprised that the Minister of Trade and. Customs should for so long have continued to furnish such evasive answers. If he is not prepared to administer the law, I am ready to go to the length of seeing that he is displaced by some person who will. </para>

                        <para>.- I desire to direct attention to a matter which is nothing more nor less than a public scandal. As the House has been sitting so late in discussing the Tariff, I naturally felt a certain amount of compunction in bringing it forward upon the motion for adjournment, as otherwise I should have done, and the matter to which I refer could scarcely come within the scope of the question. The subject to which I invite the attention of the Government is the unconscionable sweating which is being carried on in the Cairns post-office. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. I wish to know why this state of things is permitted to continue. In the first place, however, I should like to ascertain who is responsible for the erection of these post-offices. I am aware that after the necessary money has been voted for their erection, the work passes to the control of the Department of Home Affairs, which is charged with the task of preparing plans and erecting the buildings. But in many cases these post-offices when erected are totally inadequate for the purposes for which they are constructed. The Cairns post-office, which was only recently erected at a considerable outlay, has already been found to be too small for the work which it has to perform, with the result that the old building has had to be utilized in order to provide additional accommodation. A few days ago I showed the Postmaster-General a telegram from Irvinebank, in my own electorate, where an office which has only just been opened is already too small for the requirements of the public. As a matter of fact, the accommodation which it provides is less than that which was provided by the old building. In the Cairns post-office, the sweating which is carried on is a disgrace to the Department. There are only eight men employed there, and they have to handle a very large quantity of mail matter. In this connexion, I cannot do better than quote an extract from a local newspaper, which, after referring to some complaints which have been made in this House concerning the General Post Office, Sydney, says - </para>

                        <para>As a matter of fact, though the Sydney figures seem big at first glance, they work out at much less than do the hours of the employés at the local office, who, in a fortnight, put in from 14 to 17 hours' overtime, for which they get time off - and have to get it when they can, but not necessarily when they want it. As a general average, there are about 30 tons of mails inward and outward, passing through the Cairns office each week, numbering about 1,450 bags and parcels. One has to see the condition of the office on mail nights - and especially up till the last week, in the old building - to realize the work entailed. Much of the mail is, of course, made up of bulky parcels, but thousands of letters and papers go to make up the balance, and which have to be sorted and sifted and packed in the right box, bag, or pigeon-hole, And this work is being done with a staff of eight at the most, after drawing on all available employés in the office...... As an instance of the extra strain which is occasionally put upon the local staff, the occasional clashing of the southern and western mails may be cited, as occurred on Tuesday last. The Kuranda arrived late, and the western mail arrived in on top of it, the eight men on the mail staff, between the hours of  6  o'clock on Tuesday evening, and 3 a.m. on Wednesday, had to deal with a mail of 262 bags and parcels. This, of course, is not a weekly experience, but it is an occurrence by no means rare. In the Telegraph Branch, also, the officers are asked to perform tasks and put in hours which are far in excess of those in other portions of the State. </para>

                    <para class="block">In corroboration of that statement, I might cite figures from the annual report of the Cairns Chamber of Commerce, which says that the cash receipts of the local post-office for the year ended 31st December, 1906, were£107,772 19s. 8d., and the cash payments £58,491 13s.10d. The total cash transactions in 1906 were£166,264 13s. 6d., as against £120,916 18s. for 1905. The letters received from other offices numbered 1,014,036, and the newspapers 1, 006, 200. The letters despatched to other offices totalled 1,120,517, the. mails despatched to 20,984, and the mails received to 29,314. These figures go to show that the press reports have not exaggerated the quantity of mail matter which has to be dealt with in the Cairns post-office. I ask the Postmaster-General to take this matter into consideration. This is the first occasion on which I have voiced in the House a grievance of this nature, and I have taken this step because there is some one beyond the Minister whose ear I wish to reach. I recently brought under the notice of the Postmaster-General another matter in connexion with which he could not do that which he desired, because of the position of an officer who has a great deal to do with the Public Service. </para>

                            <para>- I am not prepared to go so far as to so describe the officer in question, but it is undeniable that the sweating which is taking place in the Postal Department throughout the Commonwealth is not the fault of its officers. The Department is now a paying concern, and therefore one cannot speak too strongly of the sweating which is taking place in connexion with it. I do not know what spirit animates the present Administrator, but his immediate predecessor proposed to confer on a section of the community a boon at the expense of the employes in his own Department. There has been in the Department for some years a system of sweating in operation, and if this boon is to be conferred it will be at the expense of  those who ought not to be asked to bear the burden. I refer to the introduction of penny postage. </para>

                        <para>.- The honorable member for Hindmarsh has drawn attention to a matter so serious that I am surprised that it has not received more attention on the part of honorable members. He asserted that the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act had practically been set aside. When we voted for that measure it was understood that it would be put in operation wherever those to whom it applied failed to observe fair conditions of labour. If the law is faulty the sooner we amend it the better. Within a short period the Government propose to introduce a similar Bill in respect of certain industries as to which increased protective duties have been, or are, to be granted, and it is just as well- that we should know at once whether the trouble in regard to the agricultural machinery trade is due to faulty legislation or to the failure of the Minister to put the law into operation. The honorable member for Hindmarsh intimated that if the law were effective, and the Minister were not prepared to carry it out, he would be ready to turn out the Government. The honorable member invariably states his case in a temperate manner, and if the position is as serious as he has represented it to be, there is only one course open to us. I am surprised that the leader of the Labour Party has not taken action. I should have liked to see him submit a motion of censure against the Government. When the honorable member for Hindmarsh said that we ought not to be always fooling the workers, I interjected that we had no right to fool them at all. We ought 'not to fool any section <inline font-style="italic">e</inline> of the community, and if the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act was intended to be a mere sop, and will not enable us to carry out the object that we have in view, the sooner we amend it the better. If, on the other hand, it is effective, then the Minister of Trade and Customs should lose no time in putting it into operation. A similar complaint has been made . in another place, in regard to the administration of the Excise Tariff (Spirits) Act, and I should like to have an explanation from the Minister, who, I trust, will give his serious attention to the matter. There is another grievance which I desire to voice, and which I have already . brought under the notice of the Postmaster-General. It appears that the postal authorities have recently issued a new regulation regarding the postage upon packets. Under the old regulation circulars or other correspondence enclosed in envelopes partly opened at both ends were carried at a reduced rate. That regulation, however, has been repealed, and the reduced rate now applies only to parcels one end of which is completely open. Very little publicity has been given to this alteration, with the result that many people, ignorant of the change, are complying with the old regulation, and the persons to whom they write are being subjected to surcharges. One of my constituents had to pay a surcharge of 8d. in one case, and 6d. in another, although the old regulation had been observed. He is a keen business man, but he was not aware of the new regulation. Within the next few weeks thousands of Christmas cards will be passing through the post, and in the absence of greater publicity being given to the new regulation many people will be penalized. I hope that the Postmaster-General will make it clear that those who obey the old regulation will not be surcharged or penalized in any way, and that on the other hand if the new regulation is to remain iri force he will promise that the utmost publicity shall be given to it. </para>

                        <para>. - I think that the Ministry will admit that I have never harassed them in regard to the policy of the new protection. But I am one of those who entered the House on the wave of that policy, and unless I am able to show my constituents that the statements which I made on the public platform with regard to it were absolutely sincere and had some foundation in fact my position must necessarily be weakened. If the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act is ineffective the Minister should at once inform the House of that fact, and afford it an early opportunity to pass amending legislation. If there be some doubt as to its efficacy then it would be well to have a test case which would put the matter at' rest. The Minister  by his inaction is jeopardizing the passing of the Tariff. Many of us have assured the public that by means of the new protection the workers and the people generally will be afforded an opportunity to participate in the benefits which the new Tariff will confer upon various industries. Is it not idle to tell the worker that the new protection will benefit him if the Government are not prepared to put it into operation? I do not suggest that they are not doing their duty, but if the dissatisfaction with regard to the administration of the harvester legislation is not speedily removed they will experience great difficulty in securing the imposition of higher duties on items shortly to be dealt with. The Protectionist Party, as well as members of the Labour Party, have been returned pledged to the policy of the new protection, and we desire to see it speedily carried into effect. If nothing is to be done then some of us may have to seriously consider our position, and I suppose that the Government, under the circumstances, will have to do likewise. I believe that in this industry there is as much capital invested, and as many workers employed, as in most of the manufactures carried on in Australia; and if legislation is to break down in its application in this connexion, what may we not have to face when the whole of the protected industries of the Commonwealth are concerned? The Government will have to assure honorable members and the public that something will be done to bring the present legislation into operation, or that more effective legislation will be introduced ; otherwise Ministers can only admit that the new protection cannot be carried into operation. The honorable member for Herbert has ventilated a grievance in connexion with the administration of the Post and Telegraph Department in Queensland ; but complaints are not confined to that State. The mass of the people believe that the Postmaster-General has the supervision of the whole of the administration, and he is blamed for what has been described in most of the States as the present state of chaos. If the Postmaster-General is not to blame, then it is just as well that the public should know whether some other official, or the law, can be held responsible. </para>

                            <para>- I am not complaining of the fact that the new Deputy Postmaster-General for Victoria has been brought from Queensland, and it is unfair to suggest that I am making any such complaint. What I am pointing out is that in the whole of the service in Victoria, the Public Service Commissioner was unable to find one man fit for the position, and that an officer has been brought from Queensland, where the administration of the Department is admittedly as chaotic as in Victoria. </para>

                            <para>- I have heard similar complaints made in regard to all the other States ; and the public are entitled to know where the fault lies and how it may be remedied. I shall not dwell on this question any longer ; but I think I am perfectly justified in placing the facts before the Committee. However,I have a grievance against the Defence Department. We have been told time and again that one great essential to defence is to teach our men to shoot ; and I may say that in the Commonwealth Public Service there are a number of officers who have qualified themselves in this connexion. Members of the Public Service in Victoria were very successful in competitions in Queensland, and also when pitted against the British team in New </para>

                        <para>.- I think that the Postmaster- General might look a little, more into one or two matters to which attention has from time to time been called. I am not making any complaint, but, personally, as the representative of a district from which complaints have " come, I should be glad if one or two comparatively small matters engaged a little more attention than they have received hitherto. In South) Australia a good deal of dissatisfaction exists because of the non-supply of telegraph messengers. There is a rule of the Department, I believe, that unless so much revenue is received at an office, the outlay of £25 a year for a messenger is not regarded as justifiable. At the same time, there is a feeling amongst the public that the old system of employing messengers is far more encouraging to business than one which is really parsimony and not economy. There are also complaints in regard to excessive -work thrown on the postmasters in some of the towns in South Australia. I do not desire to specify any particular town, but it is urged that too much work is expected for a comparatively small salary; and I know that the Postmaster-General will look into the matter and do what he can to dispel the discontent. In regard to the new protection, I really think it would be better for the Government, now that they intend to re cast the whole system - to establish a new and . extensive inquisitorial machine - to test their powers to pass such' legislation. I speak . as one sympathetic with the object in view. The honorable member for Melbourne Ports mentioned the anxiety of protectionists to take steps in this connexion, but the honorable member forgets that free-traders, feeling that protection has not accomplished what was predicted of it, are also anxious to see that the workers share in the benefits of any duties that may be imposed. I may say that the first time a provision found its way on to the statute-book, protecting the labourer, it was at my instance, in the case of the Australian Industries Preservation Act. There is a provision in that Act that it shall not apply to any industry in which the conditions of labour are not fair. That amendment, I may say, was the Government gloss on the amendment which I tabled, and which they at first opposed, but, finding the House favorable, finally adopted,- and fathered before the country. Under that provision the Commonweal'th can refuse to stop imports unless the conditions of labour in the local industry are fair and reasonable; and, in this, of course, we have absolute jurisdiction, seeing that imports only are affected. </para>

If the provision be impracticable, why the hypocritical pretence by the Prime Minister at Ballarat, when he referred to the wonderful stroke of business on the part of the Government in including it in the Act? I do not wish to be tempted into a discussion of whether the provision be operative or not; but the fact remains that the Commonwealth has the power to refuse to stop imports if the conditions of labour in the local industry are not fair and reasonable. </para>

                            <para>- The Postmaster-General is impugning his own legislation, and, perhaps, I have a higher respect for the time of the House than he has. The honorable gentleman seeks to tempt me, as if I were an untried member, into a useless discussion as to the possible effect or fairness of the provision. The new protection is engaging the attention of the Courts, and we are apparently throwing on the Judiciary a task which it may be unable to accomplish fairly, in the view of all those interested. The Ministry now propose to bring in a Bill to appoint a permanent Board, armed with extraordinary inquisitorial powers, whose operations may be going on for years, and it is as well that we should test our right to place such legislation on the statute-book. I do not wish to offer an opinion on the subject. There are <inline font-style="italic">dicta</inline> of American judges which throw great doubt on our right to pass this legislation. As our Acts expressly profess to exercise powers of industrial legislation, under the guise of imposing Excise provisions, it seems to me that their constitutionality is more than a little doubtful. If, after all the trouble thrown on the Bench, and the incidental heartburnings to which the proceedings must give rise, we impose a very burdensome Tariff, and it is found that our legislation is all bad, the position will be deplorable. I therefore ask the Ministry to act on the suggestion of the honorable member for Hindmarsh, to test the constitutionality of our legislation by requiring some person who has not applied to the  President  of the Arbitration Court to pay Excise from the beginning of this year. If it is found that we cannot do justice to labour under these provisions, it will be incumbent on Ministers to seek for other means. The matter is important, and the sooner it is dealt with the better. </para>

                        <para>. - I am loth to delay the consideration of the Tariff, but I have a few words to say on the Excise question. I have sympathized with Ministers in their desire that employers should be given sufficient time to accommodate themselves to the new conditions imposed by the Excise Acts; but the question now arises whether they are not getting too much consideration, so that the Acts are becoming a dead letter, and what should have been an object-lesson to us in the preparation of new legislation has failed to have that effect.  The  Acts in question were experimental, and admittedly somewhat difficult to administer ; their constitutionality we need not argue now. </para>

                            <para>- It is useless to accentuate the difficulties, and apparently nothing is being done to overcome them. Before we proceed to new legislation of this nature, or even with the Tariff, we should know what are the defects of the Acts which we have passed; whether they are administrative and preventible, or such as we cannot deal with. I do not wish to be always hammering away at the Government in connexion with this matter, but Ministers should use as much energy as possible, and it is questionable whether they have clone all that the Acts allow. In my opinion they have not. I drew attention, a month or two back, to the fact that in October last the time allowed to the distillers to comply with labour conditions would expire. It has been stated that the Government had given the distillers twelve months' grace; but that was really given to them by the Act. </para>

The whole blame does not lie with the present Minister of Trade and Customs. When the Treasurer occupied that position, I drew his attention to the fact that the Act would come into operation on the 12th October, and asked that the necessary information should be collected beforehand. I .understand that that information is now being collected. </para>

                        <para>.- It is only natural that .grave dissatisfaction should 'be expressed on this subject. Over twelve months ago the Government wheedled Parliament into imposing high protective duties for the benefit of manufacturers who are now persecuting their employes, making their lives a burden, and ruining them by law expenses. If it takes twelve months to apply an Excise Act to a few manufacturers of harvesters, how long will it take to apply the new protection to all the manufacturing interests of Austra-`Iia? In every item of the Tariff, manufacturers are getting increases which the Committee would not grant if they knew that the Excise law would be inoperative. Did not honorable members hope that the employes would also benefit? Yet, after more than ' a year has elapsed, the Government has not . attempted to give effect to Acts passed to secure that in. the case of certain industries. Is this inaction due to defects in the law, or to want of grit on the part of Ministers ? It may be very well to say that the present Minister of Trade and Customs is not to blame, but Ministers as a whole are at fault, because they have done nothing, and nothing will be done until the House bestirs itself, and demands that action be taken." </para>

                            <para>- It is twelve months since the Act was passed, and yet no serious attempt has been made by the Government to administer it. I have no hesitation in saying that a large number of honorable members have supported the imposition of high Tariff duties in the expectation that the workers will obtain some benefit from their operation under the scheme of new protection which is to be introduced. But, judging by what has already, taken place in connexion with the administration of the Excise Tariff Agricultural Machinery Act, they are doomed to disappointment. I warn honorable members not to allow the Tariff to be transmitted from this Chamber in sections until the Bill relating to the new protection has been disposed of. Otherwise they will be at the mercy of the Government. Anybody who read the reply of the Treasurer to the deputation which waited upon him yesterday in reference to the collection of Excise under the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act will agree with me that it was a thoroughly "yes-no" reply. It consisted mainly of a plea that the manufacturers must not be harassed. </para>

                            <para>- Numerous high duties have been agreed to by honorable members in the belief that the new protection scheme will benefit not only the manufacturers but the workers and the consumers. I do not wonder that the protectionist members of the House - and particularly, of the Labour Party - are becoming anxious about this matter, because when the Tariff has been disposed of - if the new protection proposals of the Government are not satisfactory - they will be perfectly helpless. There is another matter to which I desire to direct attention. I refer to the way in which the Commonwealth public servants of South Australia have been treated. Upon a number of previous occasions I have dealt with this question. When the draft Constitution was under consideration in the Federal Convention it was clearly laid down that all existing and accruing, rights would be preserved to transferred officers. But what are the facts ? As a result of the reclassification scheme - and I should not have mentioned this matter but that the officers affected cannot obtain any satisfaction from the . Public Service Commissioner - 100 postmasters in South Australia have had their salaries reduced by amounts ranging from ^5 to <inline font-style="italic">?150</inline> per annum. Any attempt to secure redress of these grievances is flouted by the Public Service Commissioner, and if an officer dares to approach a member of Parliament he is threatened with the penalty that attaches to a breach of internal discipline. I wish to quote a few passages from the speeches delivered by members of the Federal Convention with a view to show how our public servants have been misled in this connexion. Undoubtedly it was the intention of the framers of our Constitution that all existing and accruing rights should be preserved to our public servants. In speaking at the Adelaide Convention when clause 83 - which is now section 84 - of the Constitution was under consideration, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gordon</inline> said - </para>

                        <para>Two points arise out of this. Is it the intention of the draftsman to make compulsory service under the Federal Parliament, whether the officers like it or not? The second point is more important. In the sixth line of the clause, it says, " and every such officer shall be entitled to receive from the State any gratuity, pension, or retiring allowance, payable under the law of the State, on abolition of, his office," so that if a man only happens to be twenty-one years of age, and is transferred to the Federal authorities, he is to receive from the State the full compensation he is entitled to receive on the abolition of his office, although for the rest of his life, he may be employed by the Federal authority. </para>

If this is not done, there will be a manifest injustice to a very great number of citizens in Victoria, and, without imputing selfishness or want of patriotism to civil servants of Australia, I have no hesitation in saying that we shall be inducing a large number of citizens to vote against Federation in defence of their own rights and their living, and in defence of justice.

                    <para class="block">Accordingly a provision was inserted in the Constitution which declares that all existing and accruing rights are preserved to transferred officers. But, as a matter of fact, experience has, shown that quite the reverse is the case. I have already referred to the fact that, under the classification, a large number of officers suffered a reduction of salary, ranging from ?5 to?150 per annum. About ninety officers have been deprived of increments, ranging from ?10 to ?30 per annum, to which they were entitled under the State law.

Officers in the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth classes, under the same Act, were entitled to an annual increase of ?10, the only condition being that -  in no case shall any annual increase be granted except upon satisfactory proof of the industry and general good conduct of the officer. </para>

                    <para>I do not know whether it is generally known that officers transferred from the South Australian Public Service have been deprived of all these increments. I have on other occasions referred to the discontent prevailing in the Public Service of the Commonwealth, and it is no exaggeration to say that, from one end of the service to the other, the utmost dissatisfaction prevails. Officers consider that they were misled by the speeches delivered by members of the Convention when clause 84 of the Constitution was under consideration. Another grievance is that not the slightest attention has been paid to the provisions of the South Australian Civil Service Act in regard to the retirement of officers who have reached the age of 65 years. Under that Act - </para>

                    <para class="block">In many cases officers transferred from the South Australian to the Commonwealth service, on reaching the retiring age, have been summarily dismissed, and have not received the advantage of the six months' notice to which they were entitled. I know of competent letter carriers, mail-cart drivers, and others who were thus turned adrift, although they were capable of rendering for many years good service to the Department. Under the State law, they would have been allowed to remain in the service, but they have been unable to obtain any satisfaction from the Commissioner. He is a law unto himself, and interprets the Constitution as seems to him best. Notwithstanding that many eminent counsel, including <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Josiah</inline> Symon, are emphatically of opinion that, under section 84 of the Constitution, the rights and accruing rights of officers at the time of transfer must be observed, nothing has been done. It may be asked, " Why do not these men go to law "? My answer to such a question would be that the law is a very expensive luxury, and that the cost of conducting a suit against the Commonwealth would be very great. The speeches delivered by some of the present occupants of the High Court Bench when, as members of the Federal Convention, they were discussing clause 84 of the Constitution, should satisfy honorable members that the men to whom I refer have been done a very grave injustice. Under the South Australian law, a public servant, after a certain period of service, is entitled to eight months' leave. The Public Service Commissioner of the Commonwealth, however, has placed an entirely new construction upon that provision in so far as it relates to transferred officers, and practically disregards it. I would also point out that almost every conceivable duty is piled upon officers in the Postal Department. They are made clerks of courts and Customs officers in country districts, electoral registrars, and  deputy  returning officers, and they have, in addition, to carry out the work of Savings Banks agencies. Under the State law of South Australia they received special remuneration for these additional duties; but as officers of the Commonwealth they do not. The only exception is in the case of a man who is appointed a  deputy  returning officer ; he is granted  £2 2s.  for discharging the duties of that office. Can any one deny that these public servants have not every reason to be dissatisfied, seeing that, apart altogether from the additional duties that are being piled upon them, they have been called upon to make great sacrifices for the Commonwealth? I am sure that no honorable member desires to see any member of the Public Service deprived of his rights. The rights accruing to transferred officers when the Department was taken over by the Commonwealth certainly ought to be preserved. The recruits, of course, come under the new law, but why should men who, under the State legislation at the time of their transfer, were entitled to receive increments of  £10  and  £15  per annum, be deprived of those increases? And why, I ask, should a vigorous old man be turned adrift when he is capable of doing his work, and is even more reliable in some cases than are younger members of the service ? </para>

                            <para>- I knew a man who, as a boy, served in the office of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Todd, one of the oldest officers in the Postal Department of South Australia. After his transfer to the Commonwealth his salary was reduced, and he took the matter so much to heart that he died soon afterwards. I think that the Prime Minister should take action. A month ago it was shown in this House that there was much dissatisfaction in the Department in New South Wales, and officers in the Department in South Australia, in the statement of their case, from which I have made quotations, clearly prove that they have a strong claim for consideration. Nevertheless, they can obtain no satisfaction from the Commissioner, and if they appeal to a member of this Parliament to assist them, they are held to have committed a breach of the regulations, and to be deserving of punishment. The matter ought to be looked into. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that, so far as this matter is concerned, an amendment of the Act is necessary. The wording of section  84  of the Constitution was followed in the Public Service Act in order that the rights of transferred officers should be preserved; but the Public Service Commissioner has so interpreted the law that they are not being recognised. The only alternative open to these men is to resort to law, but when a man is turned adrift, with perhaps only a few pounds by him, he does not feel much disposed to engage in costly litigation. I trust that the Ministry will take action with a view of remedying these grievances. If they do not, I shall bring the matter forward again and again until redress is obtained. </para>

                        <para>. - Prior to the close of the last financial year, steps were taken to secure the. appointment of  1,000  additional officers in the Postal Department of the Commonwealth. It was recognised that at least that number was required. But as I have already stated, the Treasurer was of opinion that we were passing through abnormal times, and that it was unnecessary to appoint such a large number of permanent hands. He has, however, made provision on the Estimates for  600  more employes, and has promised to provide for all the temporary hands that may be required to tide us over the interim. </para>

                            <para>- I am not seeking to do so. I am merely stating a fact, the responsibility for which was taken by the Treasurer when he delivered his Budget statement. The Treasurer has to say what amounts he will place on the Estimates; and he evidently had the support of honorable members when he said that, in his opinion, these were abnormal times, and that to provide for the full number of permanent hands, who could not be removed, would be unwise at this particular juncture. </para>

                            <para>- That is what we think ; but the Treasurer is responsible to Parliament for the expenditure. This is not a new matter. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner, prior to his very last financial statement, reduced the expenditure of this Department by £50,000. As I say, this is not by any means a new matter ; but it illustrates the extreme difficulties there are in administering a Department of the kind. On the one hand, there is the Treasurer reviewing the proposals, and, on the other, the Public Service Commissioner, who regulates the number of employes ; and then, in addition, the public works are carried out by the Department of Home Affairs. No one knows the difficulties of the position better than does the honorable member for Parramatta; but I think that he, and honorable members generally, will give me credit for doing my best to meet the extraordinary demand. I have already issued instructions that, after the 1st January next, all post-offices are to close at  6  o'clock. That will relieve very considerably the sweating that is complained about. </para>

I will say, in another form, that if the honorable member were fully aware of the facts, he would know that in Western Australia, at any rate, there would be no inconvenience to the public. The present is one of those regulations which impose a great hardship on employés without any corresponding benefit to the public. </para>

This shows the unwisdom of introducing a subject of this kind into an important discussion like that on the Tariff. Some regulation has been broken, though no new regulation has been made; and good reasons can be given for the surcharge to which the honorable member referred. </para>

                            <para>- If we desire people to live in the country, they must be given postal and other facilities. The new regulation, if carried out, will cause a hue and cry from the Gulf of Carpentaria to Cape Leuwin ; and I advise the Minister to reconsider the matter.  <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. HUGHES</inline> (West Sydney) [4.26].- A grievance which I laid before honorable members on the last occasion of this kind remains unsettled, namely, the nonpayment by the Postal Department of moneys properly due to persons under contracts for certain works. I now understand that the claimants ought not to have applied to the Postal Department, but to the Department of Home Affairs ; and this appears to me to be a very interesting way, of evading responsibilities, though not one to commend itself to any business man. If the firm of David Jones and Company, or Foy and Gibson, had to refer an account from the mantle department to the department of stockings and underclothing, there would not be a delay of ten or fifteen weeks in the settlement ; and there ought not to be any such delay in the case of Government accounts. It reflects great discredit on a great Department when, time after time, men have to ask for money they have- honorably earned. As to the undermanning in the Department, there has been as yet- no1 marked improvement in Sydney. No doubt the Postmaster-General has his hands full ; but I do press on him the necessity of doing something. The aim of the Department is not merely to save money, but also to spend money properly by doing good service to the community ; and I hope the honorable gentleman will see his way clear to make such appointments as are necessary. </para>

                        <para>. - The Postmaster-General, in the latter part of his remarks, said that the new regulation in regard to closing at  6  o'clock will not apply to those post-offices where the mails arrive after that hour. It that be so, then the first statement of the Postmaster-General, that the regulation will apply to all offices, must be wrong. This is a point on which we ought to be quite clear. In country districts and mining towns, evening is the only time when the bulk of the people can attend to their postal business ; and the new regulation will prove a great hardship. There is no doubt that many of the post-offices could be closed during the day for hours, but in the evening it is highly necessary that they should be open for business. </para>

                        <para>. - I should not have taken part in this discussion but for the extraordinary statement of the Postmaster-General, who, I think, would be very well advised if he reconsidered his decision. Post-offices exist for the convenience of the public - to give the maximum and not the minimum amount of convenience. At the same time, we do not desire to see our public servants worked unduly long hours or sweated. The postal authorities tried to meet the difficulty by arranging for the employment of additional hands; but on the refusal of the Treasurer to make available a sufficient sum to provide for them, the Postmaster-General is meeting the case by giving instructions that, from the 1st January next, all post-offices shall be closed at  6  p.m. But why stop at  6  p.m. ? Why not close at 4 p.m., or even, earlier, and thus effect a greater saving? If the honorable member thinks that the public convenience would be served by keeping the post-offices open only until  6  p.m., he will find that the public takes a different view. In country districts mails often arrive late in the evening, and unless provision is made for their distribution on arrival, the local community is greatly inconvenienced. </para>

                            <para>- That is an important qualification; but I think that the Postmaster-General will find that the arrangement will not effect any very great saving. Should the Postmaster-General close all post-offices promptly at  6  o'clock, he will soon find a hornet's nest about his ears. I trust that the honorable gentleman will not discontinue his efforts to put a stop to sweating, but that, before he reduces the hours for which the post-offices are open to the public, he will give the greatest consideration to the matter, so that inconvenience may not be caused. He should aim at giving the public the maximum amount of convenience, at the same time setting his face against sweating of any kind. </para>

                        <para>.- To my mind, it was the intention of Parliament, in passing the Excise Acts, that applications for exemption should be made as cheap as possible to the applicant. The Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act provides that it -  shall not apply to goods manufactured by any person in any part of the Commonwealth under conditions as to the remuneration of labour which - </para>

                    <para class="block">Later on we received an intimation that the holding of the Court had been postponed until the 23rd September.I attended on that day, and learned that it was again postponed until either the  7  th or 10th October - I am. not sure which. Personally I am not much concerned in this matter, although I have been watching the case from the 3rd September until the present time, and do not know yet when the application will be heard ; but it seems to me monstrous that applicants in Queensland should be asked to enter an appearance in Melbourne, and be subjected to these extraordinary delays. Employers, , of course, will not suffer as much as employes, should the workers attempt to oppose any application. I am not complaining of the action of the Court officials, who, I think, have tried to facilitate matters as far as they can ; but I think that, in the interests of fair play, provision should be made for the hearing of these cases in Queensland. </para>

I remember an instance, which occurred in New South Wales, when, after the starting of the western mail train had, for the convenience of the travelling public, been put back an hour, the Department closed the mail an hour earlier than it had previously been closed. The honorable member for Calare, myself, and others, had a big fight before the authorities would alter that arrangement. This is a country question. Take Brewarrina and Bourke as an illustration. These places enjoy only a tri-weekly train service. The train arrives at Brewarrina at  7.5  p.m., and the residents are obliged to obtain delivery of their letters after that hour, and to reply to them the same evening. Otherwise a loss of several days would be involved, and that would be a very serious matter to business people. In the case of Bourke, coaches run from that town to the Queensland border to connect with the mail service of that State. They arrive at the Bourke post-office after the ordinary hour of closing, and local residents are obliged to obtain delivery of their correspondence the same evening, and to reply to it forthwith, otherwise a fortnight's delay would result. At these towns the postal officials have not complained of the existing arrangement. They are content to work in with the public. Any attempt to close the offices earlier than is now done would necessitate a new arrangement being made in regard to the arrival and departure of the coaches, quite apart from the question of the delivery of the letters. Of course, in the cities, where the correspondence is delivered by letter-carriers, the position is altogether different. I am quite prepared to support the Postmaster-General in any attempt to enforce reasonable hours being granted to employes, but special arrangements must certainly be made in country districts. </para>

                        <para>. - Regarding the statements of the honorable members for Hindmarsh, Dalley and Boothby, I think it will be recognised, when the- circumstances of the case are made known, that no charge of negligence can be laid at the door of the Customs Department. On the contrary, every effort has been made to give effect to the principle which is known as the new protection. Of course it is very easy for honorable members to inquire, " Why does not the Department collect the Excise ?" Let us take the case of the distillers as an illustration. The honorable member for Boothby has stated that, some time ago, he warned my predecessor that the twelve months' grace which the distillers were allowed under the Excise Tariff (Spirits) Act would soon expire, and that consequently he ought to take time by the forelock, so that he would be ready to enforce the collection of the Excise upon the very day that the measure became operative. But what does the Act say ? - </para>

                    <para>The Act is dated 12th October, 1906, and consequently the distillers were not obliged to pay a fair and reasonable rate of wages until 1 2th October of the present year. Where then would have been the use of taking time by the forelock, as was suggested by the honorable member for Boothby? The honorable member for Perth also inquired, " Why does not the Department collect the Excise?" Surely we are not to penalize any section of the community without first ascertaining whether they are liable to any penalty for an infringement of the law? When we are satisfied that the distillers are not paying fair and reasonable wages, we may, upon a joint resolution of both Houses, impose the additional Excise. </para>

                            <para>- Does the honorable member suggest that we should submit such a resolution until we have reasonable ground for believing that the distillers are not paying fair wages? Undoubtedly the proper course for the Department to pursue is first to ascertain what wages are being paid. Then if it is satisfied that reasonable wages are not being paid, I shall be in a position to bring the matter before the House. I repeat that the Act only came into operation on the 12th October last. What has been done since? We have already asked the distillers to supply us with sworn declarations as to the wages they are paying. I gave them till the 1 st inst. to supply the Collectors of Customs in the different States with this information, and I have asked the collectors to let me have that information within seven days. </para>

                            <para>- It is part of the Government policy to see that good wages are paid by manufacturers. But we are not prepared to hound any section of the community or to practice oppression. We shall see that all those concerned observe the law, otherwise nobody will be readier than I shall to compel them to pay the Excise. The honorable member for Macquarie has asked me a question in reference to the Excise upon agricultural implements. We all know what the law is in that respect. It provides that if the manufacturers do not pay their employes fair wages they are liable to pay an Excise. The Act in question became operative at the beginning of the present year. Now it is rather a large order to ascertain throughout Australia what wages are being paid in all the shops and foundries where agricultural implements are being manufactured. As a matter of fact they are being manufactured in some very small shops, which employ only a few hands. The principle which the Act seeks to enforce is an entirely new one, and honorable members can easily understand that we have not the perfect machinery for giving effect to it that exists in the Customs House so far as the importation of goods are concerned. Some honorable members have asked " Why does not the Minister collect the Excise under the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act and under the Excise Tariff (Spirits) Act in the same way that the Department collects Customs duties"? But I would point out that in the latter case we have only to say to the importer " You must pay up or you will not get your goods." The Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act reads - </para>

                    <para>Consequently it is clear that the Excise has to be paid or the manufacturer has to prove that he is paying proper wages. How is he to prove that? He may establish the fact to the satisfaction of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. In connexion with this matter I claim that the Government have adopted the proper course. It seems to me that we ought not to enforce the payment of the Excise until we have given the manufacturers of agricultural implements an opportunity of showing that they are paying reasonable wages. </para>

                            <para>- They have to make application to the Court. This law applies to agricultural machinery makers scattered over a great continent, and unfortunately we have not at hand all the machinery that we require. But we pressed these manufacturers to apply for certificates, intimating that unless they obtained them we should demand the payment of Excise. That, I think, was a proper course to take. </para>

                        <para>There are over fifty applications by Victorian agricultural implement manufacturers for declarations under the Excise Tariff Act of 1906 set down for hearing next week in Melbourne. I understand from the Registrar of the Industrial Arbitration Court that a Board under the Victorian Factories and Shops Act is now settling the rates of wages in the agricultural implement makers' trade, and that they will have the scale of wages completed in about two months. It would be very much to the advantage of masters and men that the declarations asked for, if made, should be made on the basis of the scale of wages settled by the Board. I am, therefore, disposed to postpone all the applications until after the Wages Board scale has been issued. Before doing so, however, I would be glad if you could give the assurance that the Government will take no action to enforce the provisions of the Act against any manufacturer who has applied to the  President  of the Arbitration Court under the Act until his application has been finally disposed of. </para>

                            <para>-I have made a demand for the payment of Excise as from 1st January last, when the Act came into operation, and the question at issue is whether they are liable to pay from that date, or from 6th June last, when they obtained an exemption. They have offered to pay Excise from the latter date. I think the honorable member for Hindmarsh will recognise that the Department is trying, as far as possible, to deal with all these cases. The honorable member for Hindmarsh also made a complaint in regard to a manufacturer named Bagshaw. But I point out that that gentleman's firm has got an exemption, and surely the honorable member does not hold the Department responsible under those circumstances. It is the business of the Department to see that proper conditions are observed; and I cannot believe that the honorable member really means what he says when he accuses the Department of having made no effort in that direction. In connexion with this particular case, on hearing the complaint made by the honorable member, I sent an officer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bagshaw,</inline> who made the following sworn declaration - </para>

                            <para>- According to this sworn declaration, the conditions of the exemption are being complied with. I must say that the honorable member for Hindmarsh makes his complaints in a reasonable way, though some of his charges are very general and indefinite. However, we have had three cases before us. In one case, I demanded Excise, and the only question at issue is whether the manufacturers will pay, as I contend they should, from January last; in the next case, the officer who was sent to inquire found that a great number of the men are being paid more than the statutory amount ; and, in the third case, we have the sworn statement which I have just read, showing that the award means an increased expenditure of£1,500 per annum. No reasonable man could expect the Department to do more than has been done. In obedience - not in obedience, but in deference to the representation of the honorable member for Hindmarsh- </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable member for Parramatta made representations to me with as much earnestness as that exhibited by the honorable member for Hindmarsh, I should, though the facts might appear to be against him, feel it my duty to make further inquiry. I have instructed an officer to make careful investigation so that we may know whether these manufacturers are evading the law. If they are evading the law, then it will be a pleasure to me - as I know it will be a pleasure to honorable members to help me - to see that reasonable wages and conditions are observed. But we must not penalize men until we have some proof. I may say that these inquiries are a labour of love with many of the officers, who recognise that a great principle is involved; but, at the same time, we must not hound down or oppress anybody. There will be great difficulty in working out some of the details of the system. </para>

                            <para>-I doubt that very much. It is a good thing to have these matters threshed out here, because we are thus enabled to find the weak links in the chain. The Treasurer and the Attorney-General are preparing a Bill with a view of cutting out those weak links, and perfecting the legislation on this subject. Whatever power is given to me under the law I shall certainly use. It is against public opinion, and the desire of this Parliament, that manufacturers should continue to enjoy benefits of legislation relating to bounties and duties, while they do not observe reasonable conditions in relation to their workmen. As far as possible, we shall endeavour to prevent such manufacturers evading the law. I think, however, that the honorable member for Hindmarsh must admit that there is nothing in his charges, the making of which I put down to his zeal. All I ask is that honorable members shall not generalize. Of course, it is rather a hard matter to introduce men's names into such a discussion. At the same time, there ought to be no false delicacy in dealing with a matter of this description. Workmen naturally feel that if they give information they may be penalized ; and, of course, this represents a difficulty which has to be overcome. The honorable member for Hindmarsh contends that the men in the factories referred to have been classified on the wrong basis; but I shall be glad to know how he would propose to better the position. There is no doubt that the kernel of the question was touched by the interjection of the honorable member for South Sydney;  and, possibly, legislation will get rid of the difficulties to which reference has been made. I invite honorable members who know of cases to give particulars, so that investigation may be made. But it is not desired that there shall be an army of inspectors running about the country; and, therefore, we are "going slow " in order that the new law may not become so obnoxious as to cause any delay in its coming into full operation. Let us be warned by our mistakes in legislation in the past, and I can promise honorable members that any information or suggestion that they may make will be carefully considered. At the same time, I feel it to be my duty to stand up for men who are placed in the position of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bagshaw;</inline> there must be fair play all round. I am assured by my colleague that he is almost ready with the legislation to get over the troubles referred to; and I think I have proved up to the hilt that everything possible has been done by the Department. </para>

                        <para>.- The Minister of Trade and Customs, in the latter portion of his remarks, touched the kernel of the case when he said that it was the award which appeared to be wrong, and which was causing the trouble. In my opinion, the award, in allowing the employer to be the judge of what men are slow or of average capacity, places him in a position to take advantage of all legislation in the shape of bounties or duties, and to leave his employes just as they were before any. such legislation was passed. </para>

                            <para>- I am not going to comment on the action of the Judge. What I desire to point out is that a mistake has been made - I care not by whom - and it is the duty of the Government to introduce an amending measure. It appears to me unfair and iniquitous to allow an employer to be a judge of the capacity of any particular man in his employment. What right has the employer to be the judge in such a matter any more than has the employe himself ? </para>

                            <para>- There should be an independent judge. If the honorable member and myself were to go to law, would it be reasonable that either of us should be the judge in our own case? Of course, I do not say that the independent judge should decide in each case individually, but only collectively, according to the rules always observed in the employment of men generally. Beyond deciding what is a minimum wage, I do not think we ought to go - that is, a minimum wage based on the cost of living and what is necessary to keep a man in the average comforts of life, according to our standard of living. It would be impossible for a Court to decide as to the capacity of particular men. In any case, I say that a mistake has been made, and that it is necessary to amend the law. This is the first instalment of the new protection, and if the second is like the first- </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I am coming to that. The total importations in  1903  were valued at  £70,946,  and in  1906  at only  £53,506.  Rugs are made in Australia, but not to the same extent as blankets and other woollen goods. There has been a considerable increase in the importation of rugs, because of the prosperity of this country during recent years. As most of the rugs imported come from the United Kingdom, the duty will affect chiefly British manufacturers. According to the information with which I have been supplied, the importations of rugs, rugging, and lap dusters from the United Kingdom last year were valued at  £43, 784,  from New Zealand at  £3,032,  and from all other countries at  £7,426  - a total of  £54,242,  of which  £46,816  came from within the Empire. In  1903  the importations were valued at  £27,098.  Blankets and blanketing are now being extensively manufactured in nearly all the States, the conditions here being naturally favorable to the industry, as Australia is an immense producer of wool, which is grown almost at the doors of the factories. The industry is native to the country, and would have existed without any protection. </para>

                        <para>- It shows that there is certainly no need for a high duty in this case. It has generally been argued by protectionists that import duties are necessary to protect our manufacturers from the competition of other countries, where men work longer hours, and are not so well paid as our workmen.. Duties are always asked for, in the first instance, on the fallacious plea of enabling industries to start, and that, being once started, they will be able to take care of themselves. </para>

                        <para>- It is the view put forward by the Treasurer, and others who first preached these poisonous doctrines . in New South Wales. I would point out that this is an industry which is indigenous to the Commonwealth. The wool is grown at our doors - there is no expense of importation - and the value of the finished product is chiefly the value of the raw material. In comparison with the machinery which is used in the industry, only a very small amount of labour is employed. Only a few days ago I was conducted through one of the Victorian woollen mills, and I could not fail to be struck with the enormous amount of work which is performed by machinery. Only about half-a-dozen boys and girls were employed in the room where the spinning machines were at work. Even in the finishing processes very few men are employed. Of course the hygienic conditions which obtain in the establishment to which I refer are all that can be desired. If honorable members will take the trouble to peruse the report of the B section of the Tariff Commission, they will see that the conclusion at which its members arrived is altogether unfavorable to the imposition of any higher duty than  15 per  cent. The report is a most exhaustive one, and bears evidence of having received very careful consideration. Certainly it compares more than favorable with the report of the A section of the Commission, which slurs over the principal points that the free-trade section emphasize. I have no desire to impute intentional unfairness to the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission ; but I do say that its report betrays evidence of strong fiscal bias. In speaking of blankets And woollen piece goods, the B section of the Commission say -  </para>

                    <para>In the Chairman's report, the " reasons assigned for increased duties" are re-iterated at the end of a summary of evidence, in which these reasons have already been emphasized to the fullest possible extent. The objections to increased duties, however, which should in natural sequence follow the former, and which as a matter of 'fact were tendered in rebuttal, are very briefly and imperfectly summarized in the introduction. The effect of this is undoubtedly to minimize the weight and value of the evidence against increased duties. We therefore find ourselves once more under the regrettable necessity of preparing practically a fresh report, in which we supply the matter lacking in that signed by our colleagues. </para>

                <para class="block">I ask honorable members to read the report . of the free-trade section of the Tariff Commission, with a view to ascertaining whether there is any justification whatever for increasing the duty of  15  per cent, which was levied under the old Tariff. That section of the Commission recommend the imposition of a duty of  10  per cent, upon flannels and of  15  per cent, upon other woollens. From reading their report, I know that they were satisfied that in making that recommendation they were extending ample protection' to our local manufacturers. The whole of the disabilities under which the manufacturers, themselves alleged that they were labouring did not represent a difference between the cost of production of more than  12  per cent. In speaking of the woollen industry before Federation, the B section of the Tariff Commission say - </para>

                    <para>The Victorian witnesses were positive in their assertion that the woollen manufacturers of that State could not carry on without higher duties. They had enjoyed for the greater part of their pie-Federation experience a higher duty than the present Commonwealth Tariff. But it was also admitted that the history of the trade during that period " had not been particularly encouraging," most of the mills having had to be re- constructed at one time or another, while some had gone out of existence. - (Grainger, Q. 10460.) </para>
                    <para>The latter misfortunes had occurred under a high State Tariff. At that time, however, the industry had been carried on "without that dash which now characterizes it." - (Grainger, Q. 10720-2.) </para>
                    <para>It was further admitted that the result of the inquiry of the Victorian Tariff Commission of 1895 had been a reduction of the duty, and the object of that - declared the witness - "was to give us (the manufacturers) notice that in process of time we should have no duty at all." - (Grainger, Q.10714-5.) </para>
                    <para>A witness produced extracts from the published statistics of Victoria, which showed that the high duties in this State had absolutely failed to increase employment in the woollen mills. - (Hirsch, Q. 12858.) </para>

                <para class="block">As a matter of fact, it was contended by a great many witnesses that the effect of the operation of high duties in Victoria had been to greatly discourage the woollen industry. In passing, I may mention that in New South Wales the industry had been carried on successfully without the aid of any protective duty. I propose now to quote some figures showing the duty upon woollens, and the number of hands employed in the industry in Victoria during specified years. I find that' in  1878  there was a duty of  11  per cent, upon these goods, and that the number of hands employed was  736.  In  1881  the duty was  16 <inline font-style="italic">\</inline> per cent., and the number of hands employed was  776.  It will be seen, therefore, that the number of operatives did not increase proportionately to the increase of duty. In  1886  the duty operative was <inline font-style="italic">22</inline> per cent., and the number of hands employed was only  780.  In  1887  the duty was still  22  per cent., and the number of hands had declined to  704.  In  1888,  with the duty unchanged, the number of hands employed was  784.  In  1889  the duty was  33  per cent., and the hands employed numbered  841.  In  1890  and  1891  the same rate was still operative, and the number of hands employed was  810  and  791  respectively. From  1892  to  1895  the duty levied was  44  per cent., and yet the number of hands employed declined from  791  in  1891  to  690  'in  1895.  In  1899  the duty ranged from  i6|  to  271  per cent, and the hands employed numbered  917.  In  1903  the duty imposed was  16  J per cent., and the number of hands employed was  1,013.  It will thus be seen that as the duties were lowered, the number of hands employed in the industry increased, and <inline font-style="italic">vice versa.</inline> These figures clearly demonstrate that the effect of high duties was to discourage the industry. It cannot be urged by honorable members that in the years I have quoted special circumstances militated against the normal conditions. The report continues - </para>

                    <para>This witness also referred to an investigation made by what is generally known as the Sweating Board of Victoria - a Committee of the Legislative Assembly, which some years ago investigated the condition of the sweated industries. The report of this body distinctly  states that the evidence submitted was largely to the effect that, owing to the high duty on woollens, the clothing industry had materially suffered. </para>

                    <para>The woollen manufacturing industry of New South Wales had existed previous to Federation practically with no protection, and, though it gave employment to fewer hands and less capital than that of Victoria, it appears to have got along much better. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>We have evidence that since Federation a high condition of prosperity has obtained in the woollen industry; that the mills have been running full time; that orders have been given which they have not been able to fulfil, and that these have accumulated to such an extent as to necessitate considerable importations. It cannot be expected that those who are unable to obtain supplies from local manufacturers should refuse to import goods to enable them to carry on their business. In connexion with this aspect of the matter, we have, at page 14 r, the statement that a witness named Grainger -  was asked if the position of the woollen industry was correctly represented in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ord's</inline> report for 1003, as follows : - " I have again to report that the woollen trade industry has been exceptionally busy during the whole of the past year, an average of 300 workers having been constantly employed in one of the mills. In my last "report I mentioned that additional machinery had been ordered from England. A complete set of carding, combing, spinning, and winding plant has been added during the year, together with new machinery, throughout the various departments of the mill, and the business is extending to the other States, clearly showing that there is an increasing demand for woollens of colonial manufacture." The witness admitted that this extract correctly represented the position. - (Grainger, Q. 10762.) The witness, when asked what 'dividends his company paid, attempted to mislead the Commission bv stating that it worked out at per cent, on the total subscribed capital of ^'60,000. The balance-sheets of the company, with which the witness was confronted by a Commissioner, showed that the capital of the .company was ^30,000, upon which 15 per cent, dividends had been paid for several years. </para>
                <para class="block">It will thus be seen that one interested manufacturer went so far in his desire to obtain the imposition of an exorbitant duty as a further protection to his industry as to endeavour to throw dust in the eyes of the Commissioners. </para>

Shoddy is at all times objectionable, but it is produced locally as well as imported. The whole of our manufacturers are not entirely guiltless of its production.

                        <para>- There is no evidence to that effect j the evidence is all the other way. Out of ten samples submitted from New South Wales, four were pure wool, while of thirty-six samples of Victorian flannels, only two were all wool. It will bt: observed that in the case of the Victorian flannels it does not say that the two samples were of pure wool, so that it may have been wool of the most inferior quality. Furthermore, it was stated that the use of cotton as a mixture with wool is confined to Victoria. In 1903- the total  importation into the Commonwealth of raw cotton amounted to 464,964 lbs., of which 417,609 lbs. came direct to Victoria, and 176,453 lbs. were transferred to that State from other States. It will be seen that practically the whole of this raw cotton came to Victoria, and, according to the <inline font-style="italic">Victorian Year-Book</inline> for 1903, the mills of the State in 1899 used 154,388 lbs., which had increased by 1903 to 368,749 !bs. All these figures bear out the statement that the use of cotton in the production of woollen goods in Australia is confined to Victoria. There is much more of great interest in the report, though it is too lengthy for me to quote. I think I have said sufficient to show that if shoddy materials are imported, similar materials are made in Victoria under the stimulus of a highly protective Tariff. The alleged disabilities under which manufacturers labour in Victoria are dealt with in a striking' paragraph in the report. On page 150 we are told- </para>

                    <para>The total disability of the Australian woollen manufacturer compared with his British competitor, is, therefore, on these findings, not more than 2 per cent, on equipment and 10 per cent, in labour, or a total of 12 per cent, .on the value of the product. </para>
                    <para>As against this the British manufacturer who competes in Australia pays 15 per cent, duty and from 7£ to 12^ per cent, charges, or a minimum total of 22^ per cent, on his goods, and this without taking into consideration an average increase in the cost of Australian wool, delivered at the mill in England, of 16J per cent. </para>

                <para>The evidence given before the Tariff Commission clearly shows that there is really not a farthing of duty required - that the charges to which manufacturers outside Australia are subjected amount to a great deal more than is necessary to give ample natural protection to. the local manufacturer. </para>

                        <para>- It is not a. reflection made by me, but it is a direct charge contained in the report of the free-trade section of the Commission, who felt it necessary under the circumstances to re-state the case, and submit a complete separate report, so that Parliament might not be misled. Without a doubt, this industry was successfully carried on in New South Wales, and could be carried on to-day, without a duty; and I do not know that the manufacturers of that State are asking for any more protection. I feel certain that some of the New South Wales manufacturers do not desire more protection; and I am still more certain that the Tasmanian manufacturers do not. </para>

                <para class="block">This probably accounts for the substitution of flannels and blankets for tweed and worsted in many of the local mills. The same substitution is affirmed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Grainger,</inline> a witness, who said that it largely took place between the years 1899 and 1 901, under the Victorian Tariff. With regard to the industry itself, there is evidence throughout the whole of the Commonwealth - and I have made personal inquiries from people connected with the trade - that the mills are running to their full capacity, and are really choked with orders. It is significant that a number of the mills are refusing orders, and in some cases absolutely ignoring them. In this connexion, the following Melbourne newspaper extract may be of interest - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>A large Melbourne firm wrote to a Hobart manufacturer with whom it had previously done no business, asking to be supplied with a quantity of flannel. Under ordinary circumstances a manufacturer would only be too anxious to seize the chance of doing new business, particularly as it was made dear to him that the firm paid cash for goods supplied. He replied that he was so full of orders from his regular customers that he could " not accept any new business." The same Melbourne firm wrote to another Hobart manufacturer asking for goods, and received no reply. </para>
                    <para>The manufacturers know that we pay cash, and that it is good business, yet they are in this extraordinary position that they are unable to pick up several thousands of pounds waiting for them here. What the total arrears to all distributing houses is I do not know, but, judging by the quantity of stuff due to us, it must represent an enormous sum. This is the beginning of the light summer trade, and supplies show a tremendous shortage. We are at the mercy of the Australian manufacturers. The goods are popular, and I must say of excellent quality. When the tariff increased the duty "from 15 to 30 per cent. I had to cable countermanding an order placed in England, because we would have lost seriously on it. This rnakes us all the more dependent on the Australian manufacturers. Of course, the inevitable ultimate result of the stoppage of importations and the under-production and increasing demand finally will be a rise in price. </para>

                        <para>- The argument that an unreasoning public prefers the imported to the locally manufactured article ca&gt;nnot be used in this case, it being admitted that the latter is of high quality, and that the warehousemen would be willing to take it to the exclusion of the former, if they could get enough of it; but, not being able to do so, have, in order to keep faith with their customers, to obtain additional, supplies elsewhere. There is no justification for any duty at all in connexion with the articles comprised in this item, which we manufacture to such' an extent that we cannot keep up with the demand. But for the futility of making the proposal in an assembly like this, I would move to strike out the duty altogether. As I have no hope of carrying such an amendment, I intend to move to reduce the duty on the general Tariff from 30 to 20 per cent., a protection which will be 8 per cent, more than the disabilities asserted by the most rabid manufacturers, surely a sufficient margin. Later, I intend to move to reduce the duty against the United Kingdom to 15 .per cent., which is the old rate. Seeing that we are giving our manufacturers the advantage of these high duties, tinder  which they will have practically a monopoly of the local market, we should make sure that the articles which' they sell to the public shall be what they are represented to be. Therefore, all locally made goods should be compulsorily labelled or marked with a trade description which would enable the public to know exactly what they were buying. This might well be made a feature of the new protection to which honorable members opposite are so fond of referring. I think that the arguments which I have adduced, the evidence which I have quoted, and the facts which I have brought forward, prove conclusively that it is unnecessary to increase the duty.

                    <para>.- There is one way in which we can help Australian woollen manufacturers very much better than by imposing an inordinately high duty upon woollen goods. There can be no doubt that some of the difficulties experienced by our woollen mills have been due to the fact that they have not supplied the public with a pure article. The evidence given before the Tariff Commission, and the analyses of various samples which were submitted to that body, show that unless steps are taken to compel our woollen manufacturers to use pure wool instead of wool with an inordinately high percentage of cotton, our mills will never be a success. Personally I should like to compel them to mark upon every article that they turn out its exact constituents. We can deal with the imported article under the provisions of the Commerce Act. But if we are going to extend a higher measure of protection to our woollen manufacturers and to compel them to pay reasonable wages to their employés, it is our duty to protect the individual who is producing an honest article as against the manufacturer of shoddy. Only the other day I visited the largest mill-owner in Tasmania, and had a conversation with him in reference to the duty on woollens. He informed me that he was quite prepared to continue operations under the old rate so long as we. compelled every manufacturer to disclose the quantity of wool contained in each article that he produces. He declared that if steps were not taken to enforce the use of pure wool, he would either have to lower the standard of the article which he produces, or to cease business altogether. We know from the testimony of the manufacturers themselves  that some mills have practically ruined their businesses by reason of the fact that they have produced an. inferior article. </para>

When the Commerce Bill was under consideration in this House, it was pointed out that whilst it empowered the Government to deal with imported goods, it gave them no power to deal with articles that were manufactured in Australia. It was then urged that the proper time to consider this question would be when the Tariff was under review. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I am merely pointing out that whilst we have power under the Commerce Act to deal with imported goods, we have no power at the present time to protect the honest manufacturer against his dishonest rival, who is engaged in foisting an inferior article upon the public. I am convinced that by adopting some such provision as I have suggested we should do more to encourage the woollen industry than we can accomplish by means of an inordinately high duty. </para>

                    <para>.- In regard to the quality of goods manufactured in Australia, it is only reasonable to suppose that the States Governments will do their duty in the way of compelling the contents of manufactured articles to be disclosed. The Commonwealth would experience great difficulty in dealing with local, manufacturers, whereas the States would be confronted with no such difficulty. It has been pointed out that there is a legitimate demand for an article which is composed of cotton and wool. But if we are going to compel manufacturers to produce only woollen goods - if that is the suggestion of the honorable member for Franklin- </para>

                        <para>- That is a matter which may safely be left to the States. I wish the Treasurer to give the Committee some information which would justify us in imposing a duty of 30 per cent. upon blankets. I have rendered the Government very consistent support upon this Tariff, but I find that the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission recommend that blankets should be dutiable at 25 per cent. Even that rate, they declare, is a higher one than the manufacturers themselves have asked for. I think that honorable members are entitled to some information as to the reasons why the Government propose an addition of 5 per cent. to the rate recommended by the A section of the Tariff Commission. From conversation with representatives of several big firms a little time ago, I learned that the Victorian woollen mills are unable to supply the local demand for blankets. Under such circumstances it is extraordinary that we should be asked to support the imposition of a duty of 30 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot exhibit any great enthusiasm on behalf of mills which will not launch out when business is awaiting them. I suppose that the real truth of the matter is that their owners are not prepared to invest more capital in the enterprise. If that be so, why should we come to their aid? The prejudice which formerly existed against Australian goods is, I am happy to say, rapidly disappearing. Indeed, the public now purchase a great quantity of goods of Australian manufacture under the impression that they have been imported. The report of the Tariff Commission does not justify the imposition of a duty of 30 per cent. upon blankets. I should like the Treasurer to supply us with some information as to why that rate of duty is proposed, especially in view of the fact that at the present time our own mills are unable to supply the local demand. </para>

                    <para>. - The whole position may be briefly explained. As the item stands in the schedule, the Government propose a duty of 30 per cent., but when we reach the second column I intend to propose that the duty on imports from Great Britain be 25 per cent. The value of the imports of blankets in 1906 was £53,506, and of that total £51,000 worth came from Great Britain. It will thus be seen that a preference of 5 per cent. to imports from Great Britain will practically mean a general duty of  25  per cent., since nearly the whole of our imports of blankets come from the United  Kingdom. I agree with the contention of the honorable member for Darling, and will practically meet it by the amendment I have just indicated. </para>

                        <para>- Surely if we give local manufacturers nearly the whole of the home market, we shall find in our midst people ready to invest their capital in an Australian venture. I have read the evidence given before the Tariff Commission as to the quality of Australian blankets, but an incident which occurred whilst I was Premier of New South Wales may be of interest to honorable members. Complaint was made that the Government of New South Wales was using imported blankets, and I obtained from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLean,</inline> I think, who was then Premier of Victoria, samples of some of the Victorian blankets that were being used in Government institutions in tins State. We found that one Victorian blanket was worth nearly two of the imported blankets which we were using. Although the Tariff Commission obtained evidence which rather told against the Victorian blankets, I know perfectly well that the samples which we received from this State were much superior to blankets that were being imported at that time. I presume that the position is still the same. </para>

I rise merely to state that I intend to vote against the amendment moved by the honorable member for Lang, and also against the Government proposal to make the duties go per cent, and  25  per cent.

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Darling has put the position- very fairly. He told the Treasurer that he had been a consistent supporter of the Government, but was not disposed to vote for this duty, of  30  per cent., until some reason for the increase had been given. The Treasurer, in reply, said that the matter could be explained in a few words. I appeal to the Committee to say whether he. showed any justification for increasing the duty of  15  per cent, under the old Tariff to  30  per cent, as now proposed.

                        <para>- I know that the Minister has the numbers behind him, but I am going to put before the Committee one or two "facts which the honorable gentleman may answer if he can. Even the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission recommended a duty of only 25 per cent. That was the extreme request made on behalf of the woollen manufacturers of Victoria in a document dealing with the capital invested, interest and depreciation, capital unemployed, and wages and excessive competition, which was signed by C. E. Grainger, manager of the Ballarat Woollen and Worsted Company Limited ; G. Hirst, managing partner of G. Hirst and Company, Excelsior Woollen and Worsted Mills, Geelong; Alexander Gray, director of the Albion Woollen Mill Company, Geelong.; M. E. Collins, sole partner in Collins Brothers, Geelong; Aaron Hume, for the Breakwater Woollen Mills; E. D. Williams,  chairman  of the Castlemaine Woollen Company Limited ; Charles E. Denniston, manager of the Doveton Woollen Mill Company Proprietary Limited, Ballarat; Laycock, Son and Nettleton, of South Melbourne; Walter Gaunt, of the Alfred Woollen Mills, Williamstown; and John Y. Hooper,  chairman  of the Australian Woollen Company Limited. As a matter of fact, no justification has been given for increasing the duty even to 25 per cent. All the big warehousemen say that our woollen mills are unable to supply them with the blankets required  for  the population of  Australia.  Some of the mills will not book orders for twelve months ahead. What was the evidence given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hogarth,</inline> a well-known Tasmanian manufacturer engaged in the production of blankets ? </para>

Our opinion was that the first analysis was not carried out in a satisfactory way, and, in order to make absolutely certain, we had a second analysis under conditions at which no one could cavil. We found, as a result, that there was more adulteration in the case of Victorian flannels than in the case of any imported flannels. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. It was in consequence of the extensive adulteration that we made the suggestion for the compulsory indelible marking of goods ; and I trust the Government will see the advisability of acting on that recommendation, so that the people may know what they are buying, and get value for their money. So far from there being an increase in the importation of blankets and blanketing, there has been a very large decrease. From the statistics submitted to us, I find that £111,624 worth of blankets and blanketting was imported in 1899; £134,2 33 in 1900; £122,399 in1901; and £114,503 in 1902. From 1903 to 1906 the value of these imports dropped from £70,000 to £53,506,the latter being the lowest figure in the period with which I have dealt. When we find Australian manufacturers unable to fulfil the orders they receive, and when importation has decreased to such a large extent, what justification is there for the proposed heavy increase in the duty? The Treasurer has talked a great deal about preference to the Old Country, and his great desire to help its manufacturers ; but, as a matter of fact, it is from the Old Country that our imported blankets come, and here is now a deliberate attempt, without any justification whatever, to prohibit their entry into this country. Considering all that has been done for. us by the Mother Country, and what she is doing for us at present, the time has not arrived in the history of this young Commonwealth when prohibitive duties should be raised against British manufactures. We have been told of the position which Australian manufacturers occupy as compared with the manufacturers of the Old Country ; and it was urged very strenuously by some of the witnesses before the Commission that they were unfavorably placed in regard to the purchase of the raw material. But if honorable members take the trouble to read the evidence they will find that, so far from our manufacturers being in a comparatively bad position, they are in a much better position than that occupied by the British manufacturer. The Australian woollen manufacturer can go into the wool market almost at any time of the year, and buy what he requires, whereas the British manufacturer has to pay insurance, freight and other charges on the wool to England, and similar charges, together with the duty, when he desires to get his finished product into the Australian market. It was admitted by protectionist witnesses that there is a very large measure of natural protection in favour of the Australian manufacturer. The duty under the old. Tariff was 15 per cent., but, as a matter of fact, when all charges are taken into consideration, it amounted to 40 per cent., and in some cases to over that rate. An industry which cannot progress under protection amounting to 40 per cent. is, in my opinion, an industry not worth bothering about. I am as anxious as any one to see our woollen industry progress and prosper, and I am looking forward to the time when we shall be large exporters ; but my opinion is that the old duty is quite sufficient to develop the industry. In New South Wales, long before there was Federation and protection, there were woollen mills at Marrickville, on the Blue Mountains, and at Parramatta. </para>

                        <para>- All I can say is that the mills in New South Wales were, at the time I speak of, manufacturing as high  a  class of tweed as is turned out in any other of the Australian mills; and so far as blankets are concerned, I agree with the Treasurer that none superior are made in any part of the world. It was further stated that Australian manufacturers labour under a disability in connexion with the greater initial outlay on buildings and plant. But one reason for the greater outlay on plant is the high protective duty on the machinery required. This is the old story that the duty which protects one industry penalizes another ; and I submit that if the whole of the duties were removed, and the woollen manufacturers enabled to obtain their machinery duty free, they would require no protection. The industry was carried on under such conditions in New South Wales years ago; and the whole of the evidence tends to show that, with free ports, the woollen industry of Australia would live and prosper. One advantage which the English manufacturer has over his Australian brother is that he can get his machinery at a cheaper rate. There was also a further contention that the Australian manufacturers are handicapped by higher wages and shorter hours than prevail in other parts of the world. The protectionist section of the Commission did not seem to trouble themselves about the labour cost, although, in my opinion, that is the principal consideration when we are dealing with protective duties. We must remember that some years ago, when we were told so much about the strangled industries of Victoria, the great argument was that our artisans had to work against the low-paid artisans of other countries. But the Commission found, after a thorough investigation, that a duty of 10 per cent. would more than cover the whole of the alleged disability in this connexion. The circumstances certainly do not justify the duty proposed by the Government. Much was also said about local prejudice;but any prejudice there may have been seems to be fast disappearing, in view of the fact that only the other night we had the Treasurer boasting that he was wearing a suit of Australian tweed. As a matter of fact, right through the Commonwealth there is such a demand for Australian tweed that it is impossible for the manufacturers to supply it. What is there in the allegations as to prejudice, the greater outlay of capital required, the shorter hours and the higher rates of wages, the local prejudice, and unfair competition, to warrant the proposals of the Government? I sincerely trust that the Committee will vote for the old rate, under which our manufacturers have prospered and flourished to such an extent that to-day they are unable to fill orders. </para>

                    <para>- The reply sent was that the material which they wished to buy at 5¾d. was worth 7½d., and thereupon the importers declared that they would send to England for it. This is one of the firms which have been complaining that the Australian mills are so jammed with work that they cannot meet their orders. The right honorable member for East Sydney, who appointed the Tariff Commission, designedly put upon it only one protectionist and two free-trade members of the House of Representatives, and, unfortunately, the former is absent from this discussion. </para>

                        <para>- In support of my statement, I need only refer to a debate which took place after the appointment, in which the right honorable member promised an opportunity for its discussion, which in the long run was not given. The honorable member for Illawarra founded his speech on the basic principles of freetrade. He said that if the woollen manufacturers were not interfered with, they would not. want protection. Let us consider what is meant by such non-interference. </para>

                <para>The honorable member for Parkes, a consistent free-trader, shows in his book that free-trade is more than a mere fiscal belief. The free-trader does not want to be interfered with by any humanitarian legislation. The free-trade manufacturer does not want to be interfered with by Arbitration Acts and Wages Boards, under the operation of which wages in Australia are 50 per cent. higher than they are in Yorkshire. </para>

                        <para>- That is quite an inaccurate statement. The wages of weavers and other workers in the mills have been fixed in Victoria by a Wages Board, and although the probability is that they will be increased because there is to be a new Wages Board, at the present time, while the average wage in Huddersfield for thirty picks is 8s. 6d., in Australia it is 16s. 6d. ; for forty picks it is11s. in Huddersfield, and in Australia 21s.9d.; while we pay 26s. 3d. against 13s. 6d. paid in England, and 31s. 3d. against 16s. </para>

                        <para>- We should impose rates of duty which will settle the fiscal question for a long time to come. In China there are what are called " rice Christians " - persons who become converts to Christianity because of the rice which they can obtain from the missionaries. There are members of this Committee who  are rice protectionists. They are protectionists only for the purpose of securing seats in this House. They are free-traders at heart, free-traders by conviction, and free-traders when they come to deal with a protective Tariff. They wish to whittle down the duties upon woollens among other duties. </para>

                        <para>- When an honorable member is speaking who does not agree with the  deputy  leader of the Opposition the latter always exclaims, " Let us come to a vote." I ask him to put on another record. The phonograph always seems to be saying the same thing. For goodness sake, let the honorable member occasionally change the record. If there is one duty in this Tariff which ought to partake of a protective character it is the duty upon woollens. How did England build up her woollen industry? Was it not because she produced the best sheep in the world - as Australia is doing now - and because her far-sighted monarch, Queen Eliazbeth, absolutely prohibited the importation of woollens? Those persons who constantly quote England as the great exemplar in the matter of free-trade overlook the fact that it was only after she had built up her industries as the result of 240 years of absolute prohibition that she was able to throw her ports open to the world. </para>

I repeat that the duties levied under this division form the crucial test of whether or not honorable members axe protectionists or rice protectionists. Personally I regret that I cannot double the proposed duty on blankets. </para>

                        <para>- I was not present at the time, but I do not think the Treasurer's statement is correct. I do not believe that the honorable member for Lang could speak upon this item for two hours. But I rose for the purpose of mentioning something which occurred in New South Wales before blankets were manufactured there. The name of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vicars</inline> has been mentioned in this debate as that of a gentleman who has a first-rate tweed and blanket factory at Marrickville, Sydney. When I was Premier of New South Wales - there was no duty upon blankets then - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vicars</inline> interviewed me, and informed me that if I would give him a five-years' contract for the supply of blankets to the Government, he would erect a plant and enter upon the manufacture of blankets straight away. </para>

                        <para>- A five-years' contract without any duty whatever? May I remind the honorable member that I put that contract up for tender between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vicars</inline> and the importers. I called for tenders, which were open to the whole world. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vicars</inline> competed, and his quotation was within  a  very small figure of the competition of the world. His blankets, too, were of  a  superior quality, and actually constituted  a  better bargain, so far as the Government were concerned, than did the imported article. He beat the importers in the open market. I do not wish to prolong the debate, and I merely mention this fact to show that there is no necessity for the imposition of a high duty upon blankets. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vicars,</inline> I believe, is now manufacturing these articles in a very considerable way. </para>

                        <para>- If the Treasurer were possessed of a commercial and manufacturing experience, he would not propose a prohibitive Tariff. It would be interesting to hear his definition of fair and reasonable protection, but this explanation is withheld. I have heard some honorable members who possess no practical commercial knowledge speak upon this item. They are professional men, who can view the subject only through parochial glasses. I would remind the Committee that we are not yet a self-contained people, and we cannot afford to levy such a high duty upon blankets' as the Government propose. Just now I heard some one compare the attack of the honorable member for Corio upon the honorable member for Parramatta to the attack of a mosquito upon an elephant. I prefer to liken the honorable member to an infant in swaddling clothes attempting to run before it -can walk. Until we are a self-contained community we cannot afford to impose prohibitive duties. The working man will be called upon to bear the largest portion of our Customs taxation, particularly in connexion with imposts upon blankets or textiles in any form. Earlier in the evening I asked the Treasurer if he would agree to accept a duty of 25 per cent, under the general Tariff- </para>

                        <para>- I would remind the honorable gentleman that 25 per cent, is  jo  per cent, in excess of the rate which was levied under the old Tariff. We know very well that the manufacturers themselves have not asked for a higher duty than 25 per cent. What has the Treasurer to p»v to that? Seeing that we appointed an intelligent body of men to take evidence upon this question, surely we ought to pay some regard to their recommendations? </para>

                        <para>- I should be very sorry to stand by all the recommendations of the honorable member, when he talks in favour of prohibitive protection. Those who have travelled the world know what a prohibitive Tariff means in America. I want to protect the workers, as well as the manufacturers, of Australia, but I do not wish to destroy the confidence of capitalists. Surely the fact that we produce the finest wool in the world is in itself equivalent to a very large measure of protection. I say that when we are asked to support a duty in excess of 25 per cent, we are invited to levy a prohibitive impost. In addition to that, the duty proposed would have the effect of strangling competition, and we require healthy competition to teach us to improve our manufactures. I desire to see the woollen industry placed upon sound commercial lines, and, therefore, I ask the Treasurer to accept the amendment of the honorable member for Lang. I am sure that it would commend itself to the country generally. The Government proposal means that in the future we shall sacrifice more revenue. </para>

                        <para>- Not only will it involve us in a loss of revenue, but it will destroy the confidence of capitalists, because sooner of later we must impose an Excise upon all the industries which it is proposed to protect. An army of Excise officers will then be created', That, I suppose, will be the character of the new protection policy that the Government intend to propose. I hope that it will not be so, but it is just such a proposal as would be likely to emanate from the Government side of the House. </para>

                        <para>- I hope not. It would certainly, mean the stranglking of industries. The honorable member for Wide Bay and his followers would like such a proposal to be made, and in this connexion I class the Treasurer as the leader of the Labour Party because he is playing into their hands. He is destroy ing the confidence of capital and is. doing no good to the country by proposing prohibitive duties. The honorable member will not even explain to the Committee what he regards as fair protection; but puts forward prohibitive protectionist proposals that are detrimental to the progress of. our own industries. They will mean over-production in Australia. We cannot at present compete against England and the rest of the world in the manufacture of blankets, but surely we should be able to do so with duties of 20 and 25 per cent. The Government proposal, if carried, will mean over-production and a consequent falling away in quality, by which the working man will surfer. I ask the Treasurer to accept the amendment, and regard the Government proposition as prohibitive. I am prepared to support the recommendation of the Tariff Commission with a preference to Great Britain. We wish to give a genuine, and not a bogus, preference to the Old Country. We do not wish to see prohibitive protection imposed in order that a false preference may be given. </para>

                    <para>. - We do not want bogus preferences, or bogus protectionists. The speech just delivered by the. honorable member for Grampians, coming, as it did, from one who describes himself as a protectionist, was a most extraordinary one. The arguments which he used were freetrade and anti-Australian. I am surprised that a constituency should be so gulled as to return to this House a representative who is ready so soon after his election to turn his coat. If will not be my fault if, at the next general election, his constituents do not learn what manner of man he is. If there was one question more than another that was brought prominently before the people at the last general election, it was the desirableness of passing a truly protectionist Tariff. The honorable member says that I am not prepared to explain what I regard as protection. He has only to turn to the Tariff to find an answer; he will see there an answer to every attack and every slur sought to be cast upon me. Unlike the honorable member, I am not a shandygaff protectionist. I am sorry that he is not as good a protectionist as his wine is good. He said that he would support a protectionist policy. Does he know that the protection we propose is absolutely low as compared with that which prevails in the United States of America? There they have such duties on these items as11d. per lb. and 30 per cent.,1s. 4½d. and 35 per cent., 5½d. and 50 per cent., 2s. 6d. and 40 per cent. Those are rates of duty selected from what is, in the truest sense of the word, a protectionist Tariff. America protects her industries. She does not protect the foreigner - the Chinaman and the Hindu - as the honorable member is prepared to do. I should be ashamed to describe myself as a protectionist if I could make such a ridiculous speech as the honorable member for Grampians has just done. He asked me to agree to duties of 25 and 20 per cent. upon this item. I have not descended so low as to agree to anything of the kind. I am going to ask the Committee, in all earnestness, to support the Government proposition that the duty on blankets be 30 per cent. as against foreign imports, and 25 per cent. as against imports from Great Britain. The bulk of our imports of blankets come from Great Britain, and we, therefore, propose to grant, not a bogus, but a genuine preference. It was unfair for the honorable member who classes himself as a protectionist to make such a speech as that to which we have just listened. I shall not say that it disgraced him, because such a statement would be out of order, but I should consider that, as a protectionist, I had disgraced myself by giving utterance to such views. I do not desire the honorable member's assistance if he has correctly stated the sort of protection for which he is prepared to vote. I ask his constituents to watch the movements of this turn-coat in politics. </para>

The right honorable member for East Sydney said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vicars</inline> years and years ago tendered very closely to the importers' prices. Let me read a few words from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vicars'</inline> evidence before the Tariff Commission. In passing, I should like to say that I do not think the honorable member for Illawarra was quite fair in reading only the evidence given on one side of this question. What did <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vicars</inline> say ? - </para>

                    <para>Our firm, John Vicars and Co., commenced business in Sydney upwards of thirty years ago in a four-set mill. We have only increased to six sets, and this I believe is the greatest expansion of any surviving mill. Practically there has been no protection here ; certainly, on a couple of occasions we have had a light duty, but even then only for a limited period. In earlier times the mills depended entirely on what was known as " colonial tweeds," a good honest cloth, and made a name and trade for it; but this was smothered about fifteen years ago by the importation of a shoddy imitation. After "that it was a case of making cloth at a price, eliminating quality altogether. For many years past, and even to-day, the mill's are existing only on a fringe of the trade, depending on Government contracts and odd lines that warehouses may be short of and have not time to replace from Home centres. </para>

                <para>I know that that is true. The Parramatta Woollen Mills absolutely had to succumb some little time ago; but it is quite true, as the honorable member for Corio has said, that they had in Sydney a factory where they made up clothing for distribution among the retail houses. I visited the factory many times, and am able to say that it was by taking this step that the company improved its position. </para>

                        <para>- I do not say that they should not do so; I referred to the matter only because the statement that the Parramatta Mills had made up clothing was denied. I believe that the position of the company at present is improving, but up to the last twelve months it was not doing too well. This is my answer to those who pay that the woollen mills are doing well, and I appeal strongly to honorable members to support the Government proposition. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not think that the Treasurer can accuse me of voting generally in the direction of very low duties. Last night I voted for what I considered to be a proper duty on woollen clothing, and intend to vote for what I believe to be a reasonable duty on blankets, as well as on cotton piece goods. I have not arrived at this decision at the last moment. I have carefully considered the matter, just as I have endeavoured to consider every other item in the Tariff. I have been guided by the evidence tendered to the Tariff Commission. The protectionist section of the Commission recommended a duty of 25 per cent., and I am prepared to agree to such a duty, with a preference of 5 per cent. in favour of Great Britain. The protectionist section of the Commission reported - </para>

                        <para>- The Parramatta Mill was employing more hands before this new Tariff was imposed than ever before, and their output has been steadily increasing year by year. It is true that the proprietors of this mill have a large warehouse in York-street, Sydney, which is the centre of their distribution; and, moreover, they have always been large contractors, not only for the New South Wales and other State Governments, but for the Commonwealth Government. When I was first elected to the Federal Parliament, this company was paying a dividend of 6 per cent. without any Tariff, and since then the business has continued to increase. These are statements which I challenge the Treasurer to deny. </para>

                    <para>.- On looking through the report of the Tariff Commission, I find that Victorian manufacturers applied for a duty of 25 per cent. on flannels, a duty of 30 per cent. on tweeds, and a duty of 40 per cent. on clothing. I voted last night for 40 per cent. on clothing, and I propose to vote for a duty of 25 per cent. on the present item, because I take it that the people who are in the business know what they require. I find, further, that the manufacturers of New South Wales asked for a duty of 25 per cent. and I do not think I shall be voting against protection if I vote for the duty preferred by men in the trade. </para>

What did the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission mean when they recommended a duty of 25 per cent. ? Was the recommendation for the purpose of reducing the duty by 10 percent. in favour of Great Britain ? Certainly not.

                    <para>.- I should like to say just a word in reply to the honorable member for Gippsland as to the opinion of the  Chairman  of the Tariff Commission on the question of preference. I do not think the honorable member can point to that as the opinion of the A section of the Commission. As a matter of fact, if he cares to look at the report of that section, he will find that, on the whole, it is distinctly unfavorable to any preference. I desire to point to the wonderful magnanimity of. the Treasurer in connexion with the preference he is prepared to give to the British manufacturer of blankets. The Treasurer proposes a general duty of 30 per cent., to be reduced to 25 per cent. for the benefit of the manufacturer in the Old Country, although the Australian manufacturers told the Tariff Commission that he desired a duty of 25 per cent. in order to keep out English blankets. </para>

                        <para>- Last night, owing to a misunderstanding, an amendment to strike out of item 114 the words " And salt, gypsum, and manure bags," was negatived. I believe that that vote was given because, in a schedule laid before honorable members, it was made to appear, through error, that these articles were free in the last Tariff, whereas they were dutiable. I am assured that many votes would have been cast differently had it not been for the misunderstanding so caused. Therefore, it is only fair to recommit the item, and I am willing that it should be recommitted, if the matter can be dealt with without a long discussion. I therefore move - </para>

In regard to many of the divisions on the Tariff, honorable members on this side have had reason to think that, could the matter at issue be discussed again, the decision would be different. I have heard honorable members say, on more than one occasion, that, had they known all the facts, they would have voted differently. But in no such case has an attempt been made to recommit. If we are to make progress, we ought not to entertain proposals of this kind. </para>

Last night the facts of the case were plainly stated, and it was shown that salt, gypsum, and manure bags were dutiable under the old Tariff.. Are we to have a recommittal whenever some honorable members have voted under a misapprehension? In my opinion, it would be infinitely better, and would tend to expedition, if we left all recommittals until the end. Then let us recommit such items as a majority think should be recommitted and re-considered. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for North Sydney has asked why the Government seek to recommit this item, The answer is that last evening, at the end of a long sitting, when honorable members were tired, an obvious mistake was made. In the division which took place, only thirty-three honorable members voted. Surely the honorable member will admit that an error was committed, seeing that the Committee  decided that, whereas the raw material of these bags should be dutiable, the finished article should be admitted free. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member is usually an exceedingly fair critic, and I am sure that he would be the last to destroy an industry merely because a mistake had been made by this Committee. We must recollect that 400 men are engaged in the production of these bags, and that the industry will be entirely destroyed if the error be" not rectified. At least 30 per cent, of those who took part in the division voted under a misapprehension. The questions which we have to consider are : Are we a sane body of men, who recognise that an injury will be done unless we remedy an obvious error? or, are we to stand upon mere technicalities?- </para>

                    <para>.- This question ought to be settled quite apart from the merits of the particular item to which it refers. The honorable member for Wide Bay has reminded the Committee that only thirty-three members were present when the division was taken last evening. I submit that that is not the question which we have to consider. We must recollect that if we recommit this item now we shall be creating a precedent of a dangerous character. That means that a Minister may at any time, without giving honorable members notice of his intention - when he knows that he can command a majority - place before the Committee a question which has already been dealt with, and thus stultify a former decision of the Committee. </para>

                        <para>- That is no answer to the position which I put. I should like the honorable member for Wide Bay to consider, in his representative capacity, what would be the effect of initiating a practice of this sort. In order to ascertain whether or not it is a desirable practice, he will need to ask himself how it might work out in the hands of an unprincipled Minister. Such a Minister might at any time - if he were unsuccessful upon a division - recommit a question, suddenly, without giving notice of his intention to honorable members ; and he might avail himself of a secretly arranged majority to reverse the deliberate decision of the Committee. I know that this item touches the State of Queensland. </para>

The honorable member for Wide Bay will admit that the Committee ought to be informed when this question will again come on for consideration. If the Treasurer were to intimate that he would place the matter before the Committee on Tuesday next, honorable members would have an opportunity of being present, and the question would stand upon a fair basis. </para>

                    <para>.Whilst I fully follow the weighty observations of the honorable member for Parkes, the question of the danger of the revenue being injuriously affected cannot be discarded. I understand that an unfortunate mistake has been made in the printing of the comparative schedule, which makes it appear that these three kinds of bags were free under the old Tariff, and that the Customs Department, following a proper rule, go on collecting the old duty in case the new arrangement may not be carried out. I believe the duty under the old Tariff is really 15 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- That is a serious mischief, prejudicing the revenue, and putting every one, except those who get the bags out free, in a false position. In such circumstances I am always prepared to assist the Minister to protect the public revenue. At the same time I most heartily agree with the observations of the honorable member for Parkes. It is only an exceptional case that would warrant this procedure. It will be placed distinctly on record that the Minister only proposes and the Committee only forlows this course because of the immediate urgency of protecting the revenue. On those grounds this is an absolutely fair and proper proceeding, because we must be trustees for the public, and must not allow tricks to be played with the public revenue. If, after the item is recommitted, the Committee deliberately affirms that these bags shall be free, with a full knowledge that they were dutiable- under the old Tariff, no harm will be done, because in that case to-morrow they will be free. If the Committee decides to retain the old duty, it will simply take a step which will enable the revenue to be protected. </para>

                <para>Colonel FOXTON (Brisbane) [10.18]. -I moved last night that bran and chaff, ore, salt, gypsum, and manure bags should  be removed from the free list. I explained to the Committee that there was no method of distinguishing between salt, gypsum, and manure bags, and other calico and hessian bags, which were dutiable under the present Tariff at 15 per cent. The Treasure. was impressed with the argument, and consented to what might be regarded as a compromise. He offered, if I would omit bran and chaff bags from <inline font-style="italic">my</inline> amendment - leaving aside the question of ore bags, as there was a slight misunderstanding about them - to accept the amendment so far as it related to salt, gypsum,  and manure bags. On the strength of that understanding, and on the assumption that the Treasurer would be able to carry his party with him, my amendment to remove bran and chaff bags from the free list was put and negatived on the voices. The amendment to remove salt, gypsum, and manure bags from the free list was then put, but when a division was called for a number of honorable members, who had not heard the discussion, and did not know, of the compromise that had been arrived at, came into the chamber and voted to retain those bags on the free list. I am informed on the best authority that the clearance of all classes of bags which can come under this description, whether they were originally intended to be used for these purposes or not,, began today. The bags are indistinguishable except for the brands that are put upon them, as I mentioned last night. The Treasurer, who was clearly under a misapprehension, denied it, and said that he had himself caused no less than 400 bales of bags to be properly branded. He was thinking of a totally different type of bag. I quite appreciate the objections to the course which has been proposed, but I think that the special circumstances fully justify it. </para>

                    <para>.- I have not yet heard any explanation why these bags should be treated any differently from bran, chaff, or ore bags. How are they to be distinguished? When I .was asked this evening not to oppose a recommittal of the item, I was told that these were calico bags. If so, they are easy to distinguish. Salt bags, except in the small sizes, are not calico bags. </para>

                        <para>- He went so far as to describe the various kinds of bags, saying that there is a difference between chaff bags and salt bags, and that they bore certain brands. The recommittal of this item will be a dangerous move unless we have a thorough understanding with regard to it. If the Government are prepared to agree to recommittals, there are a number of items of which I do not approve, and which I should certainly like to have recommitted. I should commence by moving the recommittal of the item relating to confectionery, and also several other items that we passed yesterday. If we are to have a recommittal of one item simply because there has been a successful whipping going on to-day on behalf of the Government, those who do not share their views on the fiscal question will be encouraged to whip up their numbers in order that items which were carried by a narrow majority, and which were supported by some honorable members who have since expressed their regret for voting for such high duties, may also be recommitted. I am going to oppose both the recommittal and the alteration. More salt is sent away in ordinary cornsacks than in any other bags. Under the old Tariff - </para>

If, as a result of a mistake, an injury were done to industries and individuals, and a loss of revenue were also sustained, then I think that the honorable member, who now describes himself, not as a free-trader, but as a revenue tariffist, would be one of the most anxious to protect the revenue. </para>

                        <para>- That is a point with which we can easily deal later on. We are now face to face with an admitted error on the part of the Committee, an error that will not only result in injury to industries and persons, but will actually deplete the revenue. I am strongly in favour of the view taken by the honorable member for Parkes that it is inadvisable to manufacture precedents which might result in the House sitting day after day for the purpose of rescinding resolutions previously agreed to. </para>

We are face to face with a national emergency - the loss of even a shilling of revenue is a matter that should be immediately dealt with by the Committee. </para>

                        <para>- Because honorable members were not present when the misprint was pointed out, they are to have an opportunity to reverse the decision arrived at. Other honorable members who, on various occasions, have voted under a misapprehension owing to their temporary absence from the House when certain explanations were made, have not requested a recommittal, nor would such a request on their part be acceded to. It has been said that it will be difficult to distinguish between flour bags and salt bags; and so it will be in the absence of any printing. We are only creating difficulty if we separate these bags, making one dutiable and the other not dutiable ; and, personally, I should go further than some honorable members propose in order to get rid of an absurd distinction. To attain the object, which the supporters of a recommittal have in view, it will be necessary to recommit also item 113. I think the better way would be to give the same treatment to all calico bags ; but, as I have already pointed out, in order to do that, it will be necessary to recommit item 113. Does the Treasurer propose to recommit that item in order to get rid of an inconsistency ? </para>

                    <para>. - The reason advanced for a recommittal is that honorable members were under a misapprehension last night as to Tariff conditions, so far as bags were concerned. Personally, I was under no misapprehension at all, and I voted against the proposal because of the discrimination. It was suggested by several honorable members that, because I was not present during the whole of the discussion, I did not understand the position ; but, as a matter of fact, it was the discrimination which decided me, and that discrimination will continue even after the recommittal. However, I shall not oppose a recommittal if the Government have reason to believe that there are honorable members who voted under a misapprehension. </para>

But, in common with others, I should like an assurance from the Treasurer that this recommittal is not to be regarded as a precedent for the recommittal of other items. For instance, the Treasurer might ask for a recommittal of the item of blankets tomorrow. </para>

                        <para>- Then, I am inclined to vote against the recommittal. If the words " salt, gypsum and manure " are eliminated, we shall have salt bags under a duty of 15 per cent. and flour bags free. It was an anomaly under the old Tariff to have two classes of bags, one free and the other paying 15 per cent. though both were made of the same material. I appeal to the Committee to rectify this anomaly, but the proposal of the Minister will simply continue it. I ask the Treasurer even now to agree to recommit item 113. </para>

The reason why I am prepared to support a recommittal of item 114 is that a judgment of the Committee was obtained by a kind of sleight-of-hand!; and I do not see why an expression of opinion of that kind should stand as the verdict of the majority. A wrong has been done, and we want to do the right thing, but if any more items are to be recommitted, I shall insist upon the recommittal of item 68. </para>

                    <para>.- There seems to be an impression in the minds of some honorable members that the exemption applies to only calico bags. No doubt salt, gypsum and manure are carried in calico bags, but the bulk of the trade, certainly in manures and gypsum, is done in hessian bags. I have no objection to salt, gypsum, or manure bags being made dutiable, but I protest against only these bags being singled out for taxation. It is ridiculous to continue what was an obvious anomaly in the old Tariff. A Royal Commission was appointed to point out anomalies, and we are now solemnly asked to re-enact a most stupid one. We are asked to declare that bags made of precisely the same material shall be treated differently according to their intended contents. It is really offering a premium to dishonesty. It amounts to a discrimination against salt, gypsum and manure, and ought not to be sanctioned by the Committee. </para>

                    <para>. - I protest against a duty being placed on manure bags. It has been a decided advantage to our agriculturists that certain companies have started the manufacture of artificial manures. In an ordinary season the protection which we grant to the agriculturists is practically useless. While wheat or fruit or butter is exported, a protective duty is worthless to the producers of those articles. When our wheat yields are compared with the wheat yields in other parts of the world, it will be recognised that there is a very great necessity indeed for the application of artificial manures in Australia. Why should we impose a duty on the bags to contain those manures? The bags for packing certain articles  in are made out of practically the same material, and it is almost impossible to tell the difference between them. If the bags are imported under one heading they will be free, but if imported under another heading they will be dutiable. Let us have something like consistency in our Tariff. Let us put an end to that which in the previous Tariff was a source of endless confusion at the Customs House and opened the door to all sorts of fraud. I think that bags should form the subject of a specific item, and should all be treated alike. If it is the will of the Committee that there should be a duty levied let it be done. Either let all bags be dutiable, or let them all come in free. There should be consistency in the matter. </para>

                    <para>.- Last night I voted for item 114, under the impression that the " manure bags " therein dealt with are the ordinary bags used by the agricultural population, and, more especially, the wheat-growers, for the casing of manure. I thought that such bags should be admitted free. Now I understand that the bags so designated are made of calico or hessian. If that is so; I intend to reverse my vote, but I should like to be assured that "manure bags" is a term which does not include jute sacks. </para>

Therefore, if the Castle Salt Company chooses to import such bags as com sacks and flour bags, they will not be charged duty, whereas if it imports them as salt bags, they will be dutiable. Therefore the proposal is an absolute farce. </para>

                    <para>.- The reasons which have been advanced by the Treasurer are about the most remarkable that I have ever heard. At the present time carpets are dutiable at  20  per cent., and he now proposes to levy that rate upon the manufactures of Great Britain, and to increase the duty against the outside world to  25  per cent. I shall oppose the amendment. </para>

                    <para>.- It is obvious that whatever duty may be imposed upon this item, practically none of the goods enumerated in it will be manufactured locally. The imports will come principally from Great Britain. Personally, I scarcely think that any of these articles have a protective value. I therefore suggest to the Treasurer that he should make the duty under the general Tariff  20  per cent. , and that under the Tariff for ' the United Kingdom  15  per cent. </para>

The carpets which are imported into the Commonwealth from foreign countries are of an inferior quality. Only a small quantity of these articles are manufactured in Australia.

The protectionist section of the Tariff Commission recommend 15 per cent., which is quite enough. A sum of £71,000 was collected in duties last year. We are not in a position to start a carpet factory in Australia. It would require a large amount of capital to do so. I should like to see the industry established here, but consider duties of 20 and 15 per cent. are quite sufficient. </para>

                    <para>. - Last night the honorable member for Melbourne pointed out that dressed feathers were the raw material for made-up cosies or quilts. If the raw material - the feathers used for filling cosies and cushions - are subject to a duty of 30 per cent., the duty on the made up article should not be less. </para>

                    <para>.-I wish to suggest to the Minister the desirableness of inserting after the words "articles of" the words " furnishingsn.e.i." Such an amendment is necessary in order to meet an alteration that has been made in the system of dealing with saddlebags, which are used in the furniture trade. It has long been the custom to class saddlebags under the heading I have mentioned, but  for some reason a change has been made, and the amendment I have indicated is necessary to avoid confusion.

There are in various parts of the Tariff a large number of articles which are used in the manufacture of furniture, and those not specially enumerated, would, under the proposed amendment, become liable to this duty of 25 per cent. I sincerely hope that the Minister will not, without careful consideration, accept the proposition. </para>

                    <para>. - I could not accept the amendment proposed by the honorable member for Bass without knowing what its effect would be. I shall have the matter thoroughly investigated, and if it be shown that the non-inclusion of the words suggested by the honorable member is calculated to do a serious injury, I shall ascertain whether the omission cannot be rectified later on. In the meantime no harm can be done, because we shall not open the door to anything likely to have a very serious effect. </para>

                        <para>- Quite a number of these articles cannot be made here. Take tablecloths, for instance. The only thing that is done in Australia in regard to them is to hem the edges. I have said from the commencement that I would vote for a protectionist duty on any article that is made in Australia, but seeing that we are placing duties on goods which can be manufactured here we might remove duties from a number of other goods which there is no possibility of our manufacturing. </para>

                    <para>. - The entire item seems to me to need recasting. Quilts and counter-panes are not made here, I believe, except, perhaps, eiderdown and kapok quilts. Certainly cotton counter-panes are not made here. What is the use of imposing a duty of 25 per cent. simply for the purpose of maintaining " the symmetry of the Tariff ' ' ? Personally, I have not been able to discover any symmetry in it. </para>

There is more than one kapok quilt factory in Australia The word "quilt" has a general meaning. The Minister has promised the honorable member for Bass to reconsider the item thoroughly, and as the honorable member has accepted that undertaking, we might very well leave the whole matter to the Minister. </para>

                        <para>- Then we ought to address our intelligence to the item in order to put it into a proper shape. We may be compelled to stay up all night if the Minister insists, but at least we should deal with the Tariff intelligently. Why should high duties be imposed on articles which afford such little scope for the exercise of protectionist policy? Honorable members opposite surely do not wish to establish a policy of pin pricks by means of the Tariff - to have a Tariff which irritates in a thousand directions for no protectionist purpose. I should say that good policy from the point of view of honorable members opposite would be to pick out lines which would be likely to afford an opportunity for large and expansive industrial employment, and not to impose a number of irritations upon people without extending the area of employment at all. From a protectionist point of view, if you pass a large number of duties affecting the daily requirements of the people without enlarging the employment of Australian labour, you only irritate those to whom you wish to recommend your Tariff. We ought to remove these excrescences, which do no good from any point of view. Why put 25 per cent. on some of these articles, which would not lead to the employment of ten men in all Australia? Is there any fiscal policy in it? I think not. I was very much struck by the remarks of the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, because, excepting the honorable member for Bass, he is the most rabid protectionist in this House; and when he takes a statesmanlike view of matters the Minister might at least amend the item as to lap dusters. I see no future for an industry in lap dusters in Australia. </para>

                    <para>.Under the old Tariff the duty on cotton and * linen quilts was 20 per cent. The protectionist section of the Tariff Commission recommended a duty of 20 per cent., and the Government have proposed a duty of 25 per cent, in the General Tariff and 20 per cent, in the preferential Tariff. Really no difference in the old duty is proposed, because the majority of these goods are imported from Great Britain. </para>

None of these articles are being made in Australia. They are woven abroad, and come out here in the sizes. It is robbery to impose a duty of 25 per cent, on such goods. There can be no pretence that the duty will give employment by assisting an industry. </para>

It includes sheets, pillow cases and covers, bolster cases, counter-panes, bed-spreads, and I do not know what besides. It seems to me the height of absurdity to propose to tax these articles to the tune of 25 per cent., when it can be proved to demonstration that many of them are not, and cannot be, made in Australia.

                    <para>. - Without desiring to be offensive, I am bound to say that  1  distrust the Minister's statements. He makes statements, and then contradicts them. When he tells the Committee one thing, and the honorable member for South Sydney tells us another, it is not offensive for me to say that I very much prefer to accept the statement of the honorable member for South Sydney. The Treasurer seems to think that we should be satisfied when he reminds us that these duties were imposed on articles included in this item under the old Tariff. No member of the Committee has shown less respect for the old Tariff, or for the recommendations of the Tariff Commission, than has the honorable gentleman himself. It, therefore, ill-becomes him to appeal to other honorable members to show respect for either. I accept the statement of the honorable member for South Sydney, that some of the articles included in this item were under the old Tariff free, or dutiable at a lower rate than is now proposed. The Committee has shown, by a division in which the Government had a majority of only one, that there is a strong desire to exclude from this Tariff articles composed of linen or cotton. The honorable member for Parramatta has proposed that this duty be cut down from 25 to 20 per cent., and I think that is a very modest request. In view of the fact that about one-half of the members of the Committee believe that these goods should be admitted free of duty, I hope that honorable members will ignore the Minister's appeal not to reduce the duty below that imposed under the old Tariff, and will vote for the proposed reduction. </para>
