                                <para>- It is not to be supposed that any one or two human beings could make a perfect Tariff. The present Minister of Trade and Customs and myself, together with the officers of the Department, have worked very hard in trying to perfect our proposals, but I have no doubt that some anomalies will be discovered. I think, however, that you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> ruled on a previous occasion that the rates of proposed duties could, on the motion of a Minister, be raised or lowered. </para>

That ruling will give an opportunity, similar to that taken when the right honorable member for Adelaide was in charge of the Tariff, for the removal of inequalities.

That is shown by the question which I have been asked. When the honorable member for Parramatta spoke to me on the subject last night, I answered him before I had given the matter proper consideration. I shall not fix a date now, though I anticipate that the discussion will be commenced about Tuesday week. I shall give honorable members plenty of notice. </para>

They cannot do it in addition to their ordinary parliamentary business, while the House is sitting, and therefore I ask if the Treasurer will be willing to consent to an adjournment from, say, Thursday next until the following Wednesday, in order to give honorable members an opportunity to try to digest the information which has been made available to them? </para>

                    <para>. - It seems to me that this clause imposes a very great burden upon the masters of vessels. In cases of fever, no &#39;matter whether they be of a contagious character or not, they are bound to report the occurrence. If they, fail to do so they are liable to a very severe fine. How can a master obtain definite knowledge that disease actually exists on board his vessel ? I would further point out that the clause provides that he is liable for not reporting the matter if he believes or suspects, or has reason to believe or suspect, that a quarantinable disease exists on board. Then how is the Minister to determine whether the master believes or suspects the presence of a quarantinable disease on his ship ? To my mind, it is a pity that our legislation should be either in the direction of working hardship or of proving futile. </para>

                    <para>.- I desire to know whether the Bill contains any provision which will enable the Governor-General in Council to allow persons liberty to quit either quarantine vessels or quarantine grounds. Of my own personal knowledge, certain notable individuals have been permitted to leave vessels which were undergoing a period of quarantine, and also to quit quarantine grounds. I fancy that the measure contains a provision to prevent that. </para>

                    <para>.- With the general provisions of this clause I am in perfect agreement, but I wish to ask the Attorney-General whether it has been copied from the States Quarantine Acts, and whether it is a provision which is to be enforced save under the most exceptional circumstances ? I take it that it confers a reserve power which should be held by the Commonwealth, but it is certainly a very sweeping power if it is to be exercised in a wholesale fashion. </para>

                    <para>.- I would point out that this provision vests in. quarantine officers, in cases in which quarantinable diseases are not actually found on board vessels, the power of detaining them in quarantine upon the mere chance that such diseases may develop. Would it not be better to impose a safeguard against its abuse by providing that Parliament shall be notified of cases in which the power is exercised ? </para>

The ship continues to be under surveillance. She would practically be under surveillance all along the coast. </para>

Of course, his suspicion must be a reasonable one. The provision has  been inserted upon recommendation. However, I will take a note of what the honorable member has said. </para>

                    <para>.- The objection which I entertain to this clause is the very opposite of that urged by the honorable member for Wentworth. Apparently, he wishes to make it more lax, whereas I think it is already too lax. Under present conditions, if a medical officer is not satisfied that a vessel is free from infection, it is his duty to order her into quarantine. This clause will give the quarantine officer a discretion which I hope will not be too widely exercised. The object of this provision is very clear. Certain diseases have a more or less extended course of incubation ; and it is proposed that in certain circumstances a vessel from an infected port should be allowed to proceed on her way along the coast to a certain extent under observation. I think, however, that the Government are proposing to give the honorable member for Wentworth more than he is entitled to ask for. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member certainly suggested that unless Parliament had been appealed to, the quarantine officer should not be allowed to exercise his power to detain a vessel merely because he _ was not satisfied that she was free from infection. I think the clause is too wide. It proposes to give the quarantine officer too much liberty. I hope that in the regulations we shall have a recognition of the liability of the Commonwealth to be very seriously affected by a lax interpretation of this provision. </para>

                    <para>.- I should not have risen again to speak to this clause but for the extraordinary complexion which the honorable member for Laanecoorie has put upon my remarks. I cast the responsibility upon the Minister, but suggested that the clause might be redrafted so that it would be more in accord dance with the view to which he had given expression. The honorable gentleman said that the power would be exercised only where the quarantine officer was not satisfied that a vessel was free from infection. I quite agree that such a power is necessary. I entirely fail to understand why the honorable member for Laanecoorie should have attributed to me the view that the quarantine officer should not be permitted to exercise such a power as is proposed to be given him under this clause. </para>

                    <para>.- Very few of the Bills submitted to this House have passed through the ordeal of consideration in Committee so well as this has done. I think it is an admirable proposal that a quarantine officer, finding that a vessel has no disease on board - but not satisfied that she is free from infection - shall be empowered to allow her to proceed to the next port of call, where a further examination may be made. The provision is an ideal one. </para>

                        <para>- I fail to see why the honorable member should assail the wording of the clause when &#39;what he has in mind is really an attack on the administration. I cannot suggest how the clause could be improved unless, as suggested by the honor or able member for Laanecoorie, we made it more stringent than it is. I prefer to charge the administration with the appointment of competent officers. If the&#39; officers do not carry out their duties satisfactorily they should be dismissed. As long as Parliament keeps a tight rein on the administration we shall be able to protect the interests of the country generally, as well as those who may be affected by any vessel being ordered into quarantine. Under the clause as it stands, a quarantine officer may,  refuse pratique if he thinks there is a danger of a quarantinable disease breaking out on board a vessel whilst she is proceeding along the coast. </para>

                    <para>._l fail to see any objection to the clause. It is designed to give elasticity ku connexion with the administration where elasticity is necessary. Where there is only a vague suspicion that a quarantinable disease exists on board a vessel coming into port passengers will be allowed to land, subject to some observation, whilst the vessel herself will be permitted to proceed on her voyage, and may be dealt with at the next port. This is a fair and reasonable provision. </para>

It is well known that there are a good many communicable diseases in the South Sea Islands.

                    <para>. - Under this Bill we have power to issue a proclamation declaring that any place beyond or in Australia is infected with a quarantinable disease, and all vessels coming from a proclaimed place would be ordered into quarantine immediately on arrival. There are certain conditions prescribed in respect to oversea vessels generally. It might not be necessary to require vessels regularly trading between, say, New Zealand and Australia to perform the same conditions as vessels coming from eastern ports. But the intention of this clause is not to relax the  conditions. Even if an exemption had been granted in respect of vessels coming from any of the South Sea islands, it would be removed immediately a quarantinable disease broke out there. The island on which &#91;he outbreak occurred would at once toe declared a proclaimed place. </para>

                        <para>- That is so, if necessary. A vessel might be ordered to go into quarantine, and a quarantine officer has authority to detain her there. Of course, the only way in which a vessel can be detained is by the exercise of the power of the community. The power of detention is clearly given to the quarantine officer under this clause. </para>

                        <para>- The New South Wales Act deals with a small coast line, whereas the Bill will affect vessels sailing, say, from Port Darwin to Hobart, or from Thursday Island to Adelaide. Further, the clause applies not only to oversea boats but to Inter-State boats; and the words &#34; on the same account &#34; might mean an outbreak of a similar disease. The vessels are subject to quarantine until they have been granted pratique, when they go free. If, however, a disease should break out on a vessel which has been granted pratique, or there is reason to suspect that disease has broken out, there must be a reserve power of control over her. </para>

                    <para>. - When the Treasurer was in charge of the Bill temporarily, I asked him what ports were likely to be declared, and I gathered from him that the Attorney-General would be able to make some declaration on the point. I asked the question because I think there is a misapprehension abroad in regard to this matter. Certain importers of  stud stock have the impression that under the Bill the first port of entry will be the &#34; declared port,&#34; and as this may be Fremantle, they will have no opportunity to inspect their stock while it is in quarantine. I am convinced that so intelligent - so brilliant - a: Ministry as the present one would not contemplate such extreme action. I only ask the Minister to give a general idea now as to what are likely to be the &#34; declared ports.&#34; I presume each capital of Australia, at any rate, will be &#34; declared.&#34; </para>

                    <para>. - It is impossible to say what may or may not be the specified ports, but I should think that all the existing ports which have been found necessary will be declared, unless for some very strong reason. I can conceive that it may even be necessary to appoint special ports for a time. For instance, as I said yesterday, valuable stock might be consigned to a northern port of Western Australia, or to the Northern Territory, and, instead of requiring them to be brought to one of the ordinary ports of entry, special arrangements might be made for their being landed direct, always providing that they were quarantined and safeguarded. However, these are matters which must be left to administration. I can promise that every facility will be given for the declaration of necessary ports. </para>

It would be impossible for a vessel, if Newcastle were mentioned in the charter party, to make the first port of call any other port, without violating the terms of the charter, and of the insurance policy. To insure the proper carrying out of the Bill it will be necessary to establish fully equipped administrative offices and hospitals at the various ports of call. </para>

The question of appointing properly qualified officers has already been discussed and decided ; but I desire to again emphasize the necessity for insuring that at the principal ports of entry, and also in the case . of internal areas, the principal officers shall be duly qualified veterinary surgeons. A qualified medical officer has to make the inspection in connexion with human beings, and there will be a qualified entomologist to investigate the diseases of plants ; and I hope the same principle wilt be applied in connexion with the examination of stock. </para>

There is no doubt that in Australia generally the position of veterinary surgeons has considerably improved; and in Melbourne there is a proper institution for their training. At the  same time, we do not wish to act unjustly towards the existing State officers. I think the assurance has already been given that, in- selecting officers for the admin inst ration of this measure, the present policy of the Commonwealth will be followed, which is to select the best qualified men who apply.

                    <para>.- Representations have been made by the Secretary for Agriculture for New South Wales in regard to this provision. I understand that some animal diseases take longer to incubate than the time occupied in travelling here from other countries, and, therefore, it is necessary to quarantine animals on arrival in Australia, notwithstanding that they may be accompanied with certificates stating that they started free from disease. The fact that animal quarantine will be the subject of regulations does not affect the issue. We should insist on a sufficient period of quarantine in every case to determine that imported animals are not bringing with them any disease. As practically all the -stock that is imported is brought here for stud purposes, it is not a serious matter to their owners to have them- kept in quarantine for a few weeks; I believe that a period of forty days is insisted upon by most of the States authorities. If any new disease affecting animals spread through this country, it might take years to eradicate it, and then only at tremendous expense, or it might never be stamped out. </para>

                        <para>-  No. The clause provides that, if imported animals are accompanied by the certificate of an approved veterinary surgeon at the port of shipment, stating that, on examination prior to shipment, they were found to be in good health and free from disease, and if the quarantine officer is satisfied that they have not suffered from disease, or been exposed to infection during the voyage, &#39;and are free from disease at the time of landing, he may allow them to be delivered to the importer without quarantine. </para>

                        <para>-  Clause 55 provides that a quarantine officer may examine and order into quarantine any animals declared by proclamation to be subject to quarantine. If what I think necessary is done, a proclamation will have to be issued under clause 55 excluding all animals from the exemption provided for in sub-clause  2  of clause 53. I regard this sub-clause as&#34; a very dangerous one. The matter is not one which directly affects my constituents; but, if I represented a stock-raising constituency, I should be expected to offer very strenuous opposition to the provision. </para>

                    <para>.- I think that I should call the Minister&#39;s attention to the fact that very strong objections to this provision are taken by experts. In a report which I have received from the Chief Inspector of Stock in South Australia/ a man of very wide experience, he describes this and one or two other exempting provisions as exceedingly dangerous. He speaks of the Bill as very crude as compared with the well thought-out provisions governing animal quarantine in South Australia, and says that it would be a calamitous thing for the States if the administration of quarantine fell into the hands of persons who were not qualified by the possession of intimate knowledge of all matters affecting the treatment of quarantined stock, and of the dangers to be apprehended and guarded against. He thinks it dangerous to give to a quarantine officer the power to allow animals to be imported without quarantine. Personally, it seems to me that there cannot be much danger if the measure is properly administered. </para>

                        <para>- It has been suggested that the officers administering the Act may not all be experts, and .it- would not be well to give such men unqualified discretion in this matter. I believe that camels recently imported into Western Australia brought with them surra, a most dangerous disease, whose introduction is causing considerable anxiety among the stock owners throughout the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>- What we have particularly to guard against is the importation of disease from certain countries where diseases exist which, if introduced into Australia, would be disastrous to our stock industry, and to every branch of commercial life dependent upon it. As instances of such disease I might mention rinderpest and surra. .Before an animal should be allowed to be imported without undergoing quarantine, the presentation of a certificate from approved authorities, certifying chat not only was it not suffering from disease when - it left the .port of shipment, but that no disease of any of certain kinds enumerated was prevalent in the. country from which it came should be insisted on. </para>

                        <para>- There is no provision of that sort in the Bill, and I certainly think that there should be. It is too big a matter to be left to regulation, and it is of vital concern to the stock industry. I think that there have been cases of rinderpest even in New Guinea. That disease has always been a menace to stock-owners, and no regulation can be too stringent to protect the stock industry of Australia from its importation. </para>

                    <para>.- I wish to point out a very serious inconsistency in this clause. It expressly provides that all imported stock must be accompanied by-.the certificate of a thoroughly qualified veterinary surgeon that they were free from disease at the port of shipment, whereas at the port of entry the power to determine whether they shall be ordered into quarantine is vested in an officer who has: no special qualifications. I think that at least we ought to be prepared to do what we compel other countries to do. In my opinion we should have a thoroughly qualified man at the head of affairs. </para>

                    <para>. - I fear that honorable members imagine that this clause confers far wider powers than it is intended to confer. It was inserted for this reason : New Zealand, to our own knowledge, is absolutely free from a great many of the diseases which affect stock. The same remark is applicable to England, from which country stock are imported. The clause is intended to provide that if stock are imported from those clean areas, and! are accompanied by the certificates of a veterinary surgeon at the port of shipment, that they are free from disease, they may be admitted into the Commonwealth without being required to undergo a period of quarantine. But I recognise the force of the contention of the honorable member for Capricornia. I can assure him that the intention of the Government practically coincides with the desire which he has expressed. The power to admit stock&#39; without subjecting them to quarantine was only intended to be exercised in the cases which I have mentioned. I will see if it is not possible to get a clause framed declaring that if imported animals have been shipped from a port which we are satisfied is free from disease- </para>

                <para>This amendment is designed to protect the interests of men who have incurred a very heavy expenditure - often involving a personal trip to the Old Country - in purchasing stud stock, and it is also in the interests of the country. The latter portion of this clause provides that if a beast has been destroyed which is found not to have been diseased, compensation shall be paid to its owner. But I would point out that any animal may cost an importer many hundreds of pounds. If it were destroyed he would not only be deprived of the use of the beast for many months, but would suffer loss in various other ways. If he were merely paid the original cost of the animal, that would not compensate him for that loss. The clause does not fairly protect the importer. I ask the Attorney-General to draft an amendment which will have the effect of protecting both the Government and the importer. A valuable animal such as I have already referred to, would only be introduced at ou&#39;r big ports where the services of a veterinary surgeon are available. </para>

                    <para>.- I think that the owner of an imported beast should be allowed to make some protest against the destruction of his stock upon the word of a quarantine officer. It appears to me that the clause would vest quarantine officers with a very dangerous power. The owners of stock which it is proposed to destroy, should be advised of the intention of the Government, and should be allowed to appear to show cause why the course proposed should not be adopted. </para>

Throughout the entire discussion of the Bill he has approached its subject-matter with a very open mind, and he has placed a good deal of practical knowledge at the disposal of the Committee.  His  amendment proposes that no beast shall be destroyed except upon the certificate of a qualified veterinary surgeon.&#34; What State in Australia has made provision for the appointment of qualified veterinary surgeons? </para>

                        <para>- My own opinion is that in modern society almost every avocation has become specialized to such an extent as to demand the&#34; appointment of professional men with scientific training wherever possible. By securing the insertion of this amendment the honorable member might do an injustice to many men who are practising as veterinary surgeons, although not qualified in the sense that they have obtained the diploma or certificate of some institution recognised by the Government. I am afraid that the use of the word &#34; qualified &#34; would have that effect. </para>

                        <para>- The provision, so amended, would be very vague. I am sure that the Minister would not order the destruction of a valuable animal in the absence of a certificate signed bv a competent man that its destruction was absolutely necessary. Then, again, the owner of the beast would have an independent examination,. If he obtained the certificate of a qualified man that it was not suffering from any disease, the Minister would be liable to pay compensation if he caused it to be destroyed. In the interests of the community as a whole, it is necessary that the Minister should have the power to order the destruction of animals suffering from disease. </para>

If we take over the State Quarantine Department, and such officers as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tabart,</inline> of Tasmania, to whom reference has been made, are available, we shall certainly secure their services. Is it not unfair to suggest that, notwithstanding the production of the certificate of such an officer that an animal should be destroyed, the Minister should be required to go outside the Department, and obtain a certificate from a veterinary surgeon. </para>

The honorable member for Capricornia desires that a certificate shall be given only by an officer holding the certificate of an institution, or the diploma of a veterinary college recognised by the Government. In Queensland we have practising as veterinary surgeons many men who hold no such certificates. </para>

Yet the Minister, although he recognised that the officer was competent, would have to obtain the services of a veterinary surgeon outside the Department to certify that the animal should be destroyed. </para>

                        <para>- Any difficulty could easily be got over by making the quarantine officer a veterinary surgeon. The Minister will have absolute control over stock, and may direct that they be taken to any port he chooses for the purpose of inspection. Only in one or two extreme cases would there be the slightest difficulty ; and that could be got over by such appointments as 1 have suggested. What is to stop the Public Service Commissioner from holding examinations for the purpose of certificating veterinary surgeons under the provisions. of this Bill? Examinations are held in connexion with other Departments of the Public Service, and the papers are set and examined by university professors. Why could not the same step be taken in connexion with this Bill ? </para>

                        <para>- The power to slaughter is no doubt necessary; but the least we can do is to take every precaution to ascertain that an animal is really diseased. The Attorney-General has urged that it may be necessary to slaughter an animal instantly ; but, as a matter of fact, the quarantine area might be as wide as we like for the purpose of isolation, and an animal could wait until it was examined by a qualified man. . There are cases in which it would be impossible to compensate a man for the destruction of imported valuable stock. </para>

                        <para>- It would be possible for the Public Service Commissioner to hold an examination for qualified stock inspectors at the ports of entry, and these men would be the qualified quarantine officers. Under the circumstances, there would be no necessity for a veterinary surgeon who had qualified under the Veterinary Surgeon Act of any State, and who would, as I have said, not be qualified to act in any other State. We should then have in the Commonwealth service a number of men especially trained for the work. </para>

                    <para>.- My sympathy is with those who desire to protect importers of blood stock; but, at the same time, I see no necessity for the&#39; amendment; the clause as it stands is quite ample for our purposes. It seems to be implied that Queensland is chiefly affected by the clause. But it is well known that imported stock for Queensland is always taken round by the south. So far as <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> have any knowledge, no stock has been imported by the northern route for many years. </para>

Up to the present, however, since the Torres Straits service has been abandoned, there has been no importation by the northern route; and even when that service was available, there was very little importation of stock, beyond a few Timor ponies. </para>

                    <para>. - I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that we annually export to India between  6,000  and 8,000 horses, but the Government of Victoria, and, I believe, the Governments of some of the other States, on 24th June, passed a regulation prohibiting the re-importation of any horse from that country. A few years ago, I sold a horse called &#34; Great Scot,&#34; a valuable sire, to go to India.. Now breeders would like to get him back again, but, under the regulation I speak of, fie cannot be brought back, although he can be taken to England, and his progeny can be sent out here. Similarly, there are many fine mares in India which breeders here would like to buy. Not long since, , an Indian buyer offered .&#163;2,500 for the celebrated New Zealand mare &#34; Solution.&#34;  Her  owner would part with her for that price if she could be brought back again. I think that the regulation which I refer to is too strict, seeing that animals which have been to India can be afterwards taken to England, or to any other part of the world except Australia. The administration of the States is becoming too narrow, and, therefore, I am pleased that this matter is to be taken over by the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>.- It is a pity we do not follow more closely the wording of the State Acts. The honorable member for Echuca has suggested that, before an animal is destroyed, notice of the intention to destroy it should be given to the owner. Under the clause as it stands, a valuable animal might be destroyed and buried, and no chance given to the owner to have its carcass examined to see whether a mistake had not been made. In South Australia, animals may be destroyed if the inspector suspects the presence of disease. </para>

                <para>Mr.Mcwilliams.-i believe in keeping out diseases; but we should open the doors as widely as we can with safety, to the importation of the best stock, and the latest and most valuable plants and trees. Valuable plants imported from America or England should not be destroyed until they have been condemned by a competent man. Their destruction should not be possible on the advice. of an officer of insufficient knowledge, without the owner being informed. It would be a monstrous thing for a valuable consignment to be destroyed without any intimation being given to the owner, to enable him to test the expediency of the condemnation. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that the honorable member will not move to amend the clause. There are many practical men who are competent to test the existence of diseases in connexion with plants, but who are not trained entomologists. The Government entomologists to whom the honorable member referred are employed to study the life history of pests, and the conditions under which they flourish and succumb, with a view to discovering means for their eradication, and giving instructions to orchardists as to the methods to be pursued to. keep their trees healthy. The Government entomologist of Queensland, an exceedingly competent man, spends his time in studying the development of diseases affecting vegetation, and has published several papers on the subject. It would be impossible for him to visit ports so widely separated as Townsville, Rockhampton, and Brisbane, whenever a consignment of plants had been ordered into quarantine, to ascertain whether it should or should not be destroyed. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. There is very little inducement for men to become entomologists, because the openings for them are so few. The only way in which we can induce entomologists to prosecute their studies on behalf of the community is to secure the appointment of officers who will devote the whole of their lives to original research. </para>

                    <para>. - To a certain extent this clause provides for an existing difficulty. But I would point out that some of the agreements, made between carrying companies and. those who take advantage of their services, contain  covenants which virtually have the effect of contracting these companies out of liability in respect of any passenger or member of a crew who might desire to take advantage of this provision. It is a great hardship for people abouc to enter a country to be compelled to undergo a period of quarantine. They themselves may not be affected by disease, but they are, nevertheless, detained for the safety of the people on land, and they are charged very heavy expenses during the period of their detention. This clause provides that the owners or agents shall supply such wholesome and suitable provisions and medicines as are required by the quarantining officer at the quarantine station, and if they do not provide them it empowers the Minister to supply them and to charge the owners or agents of the vessel for the amount expended. But, to my mind, the provision does not go far enough to protect the passengers and crew. Therefore, I move - </para>

                <para class="block">The amendment means that if a vessel were detained in quarantine, and the provisions and medicines necessary for the passengers were provided, the owners could not, under an agreement which, in many instances, is contained upon the tickets sold to the passengers, compel the latter to refund the cost of their maintenance. It is quite sufficient hardship for persons to be kept in a quarantine ground, with all its uncongenial surroundings - because these grounds are not selected on account of their beauty, but are really portions of country which are regarded as so uninhabitable that they have not been taken up- </para>

If a man and his wife, and two or three children are quarantined, they frequently find that they are living at a rate at which they have never lived before under the same circumstances, and never hope to live again. I can quite conceive of a number of immigrants such as we hope to attract to Australia in the near future being quarantined upon their arrival, and thus finding their capita&#93; completely dissipated by these charges. </para>

                        <para>- But we deal with many countries whose mercantile laws are not nearly so effective as those- of Great Britain. It is from the Asiatic countries that we have most to fear in the way of infection. It is the ports in the Indian Ocean, and the Western Pacific Ocean, against which we chiefly have to guard. It is not a fair thing that persons who are quarantined, in addition to submitting to detention, should be compelled to pay what are admittedly high charges. Ten shillings a day is an outrageous charge, notwithstanding that the cost of provisions at quarantine stations is necessarily higher than it would be elsewhere. </para>

                    <para>.- This amendment would have the effect of making the owners or agents of a vessel liable for the support of passengers during their period of detention in quarantine. I do not hold a brief for the ship-owners, but I recognise that they are put to considerable expenditure for every hour that one of their ships is detained in quarantine.. In a large number of cases their expenses exceed &#163;300per day in addition to their ordinary expenses. They are business men, and we must consider what they will be likely to do if the proposal of the honorable member for Laanecoorie becomes law. If they are to be subjected to the cost of maintaining passengers during their detention in quarantine, they will undoubtedly introduce some form of insurance, possibly in the way of increased passage money. The burden will merely be shifted to other shoulders, probably to the profit of the ship-owners themselves. I think that either some power should be  given to the Minister to say what the charge during quarantine should be- assuming that ios. per day is an exorbitant rate - or the State should pay a portion of that charge. . The amendment would scarcely work out in the way that -the honorable member for Laanecoorie suggests. It would merely result in the charge being shifted from the owners on to the unfortunate passengers. It has been suggested to me that the owners of vessels who may shortly be entering into contracts with the Government for the introduction of a large number of desirable immigrants, would, if the amendment be carried, instead of accepting the lowest possible price for the transportation of those immigrants, naturally take care to contract themselves out of this risk. I think it would be better to empower the Minister charged with the administration of the Act to determine what is. a reasonable charge for the maintenance of passengers, first class or otherwise, upon quarantine stations. </para>

I know that the master and medical officer are liable to certain penalties for making false statements, but the imposition of a penalty would not help us if, as the result of a misleading statement, action were taken that led to the spread of disease. Cases have come under my notice which lead me to believe that it would be well to allow the passengers and the crew of a vessel to be questioned. </para>

                    <para>.- I object to this clause. I fail to see why we should compel persons to submit themselves to vaccination of any kind. As to the efficacy of vaccination against smallpox, I shall at present express no opinion ; but I hold very strongly that we should not&#39; insist upon people in quarantine being vaccinated against their will. In New South Wales, vaccination is not compulsory. There is a compulsory vaccination Act in Victoria, and that Act may be right or wrong. I do not intend to express an opinion upon it. If people on board a vessel had already been exposed to a disease and had taken it, vaccination would do them no good. It might be that it would be of service in the case of those who had not taken the disease. That is a question entirely for the passengers themselves. I cannot see what right we have to compel passengers to submit to vaccination or. if we have the right, what good it may do. There is one thing, however, on which we should insist. As surgeon of a ship on the China coast, I have found myself without a supply of fresh vaccine when members of the crew and passengers, who were exposed to disease, desired to be vaccinated. Consequently, I desire that this clause should not be agreed to, and that the following should be substituted - </para>

                    <para>.- I am glad that the honorable member for Hunter has made a suggestion in this matter, because a great power, widely expressed, is proposed by the clause. The vaccination contemplated has no relation to the particular disease in respect of which the passengers may be subject to quarantine; so that if a man have intermittent fever, he may be vaccinated for cholera, small-pox, or goodness knows what ! Then, again, vaccination is proposed without any regard to the laws of the States on the subject; and I could suggest a modification - although it is a modification that I would not accept - that passengers might be compelled to be subject to laws of the States in regard to vaccination. I trust the Minister will consent to the excision of the clause. Another difficulty is created in this Bill by the absence of marginal notes, so that it is impossible to say whether there are corresponding provisions in the local Acts. The principle of the legislation seems to be to take the widest powers we can, and eliminate every provision that mav modify the arbitrary authority of the officers administering the law. </para>

                    <para>.- I think a mistake has been made in the direction pointed out by the honorable member for Angas. The clause does not tell us for what reason the vaccination shall be made, though we all recognise that there is only the one disease of small-pox in which it is necessary ; and it would be much better to have the fact specifically set out. I am surprised to hear the honorable member for Hunter stating that in his opinion vaccination is not of much use, and then suggesting that every ship should be compelled to carry a supply of lymph. </para>

This is one of those matters in which the State has to step in and trespass on the rights of the individual, in order to protect the community, in just the same way that the authorities interfere when a man has a dangerously dirty back yard. </para>

                        <para>- It is not fair to blame a standardized lymph for all the terrible results which we are told have followed vaccination. I myself have seen bad results follow a system of vaccination which I never have, and never would, adopt, namely, arm to arm vaccination. But if there be proper lymph, the subject runs absolutely no risk. Vaccination is not so much for the protection of the individual, as for the protection of the community. An unvaccinated person during a smallpox outbreak is a source of danger, not only to himself, but to all those with whom he comes in contact. </para>

                        <para>- I hope the method will not be superseded in Australia, and I do not care twopence what they do in America. There are several methods and practices adopted in the United States which we should be sorry to see introduced here ; probably the honorable member for Wentworth would not be sitting where he is if we were subject to some of the laws at present in operation in America. The intention is not to vaccinate people who are suffering from disease but those who are to go out amongst the community. I am prepared to hear ali sorts of terrible statements about vaccination ; but two facts stand out. In the first place, small-pox is far more easily communicated to those who have not been vaccinated. </para>

                        <para>- I protest against the clause as it stands. I come from a State where more liberty is allowed than is given in Victoria, and bear no vaccination brand on&#39; my arm. So long as Australia is kept as free from disease as it has been up to the present time, the risk of contagion will be so small as to make vaccination practically unnecessary. Under the clause, any contact might be required by a medical officer to submit to vaccination ; but, had small-pox been discovered on the <inline font-style="italic">Eastern</inline> when we were coming from the north, and had a provision of this kind been in force, I should have soon been at loggerheads with the medical officers on the point. I protest against this backdoor method of providing for compulsory vaccination, and shall support the proposal of the honorable member for Hunter. </para>

                    <para>. - With all due deference to medical opinion, I hold the view that vaccination is a barbarous method of dealing with disease, and that it might well be allowed to become obsolete. I consider that cases become severe because of the antiquated methods of treating them which are employed, and that sickness can often be cured more expeditiously and made milder than is the rule. </para>

                        <para>-I am not preaching Christian Science, but the application of scientific methods co the treatment of disease. Quarantine will effect all that is required to be done in the way of preventing the introduction of disease. If contacts refuse to be vaccinated, and fall ill at the quarantine station, medical skill will be available for their treatment. The most that the doctors can say for vaccination is that, if persons who have been vaccinated get small-pox, they will have the disease only in a mild form. </para>

                        <para>- There may be negligence or accidents; that does not disprove the value of vaccination. I think that the Commonwealth authorities should have this power. &#39; But the clause should be redrafted, because it does not distinguish between small-pox and other diseases. Apparently, in India, they are now successfully performing an operation similar to vaccination, to stay the plague. The recent conference of health officers recommended that vaccination should be made compulsory throughout Australia, but, as there is not uniformity on this point among the laws of the States, it would be a serious thing for the Commonwealth to adopt that recommendation. In my opinion, the medical officer at a port of entry should be empowered to ask every person on board a quarantined ship to submit himself to vaccination, and those who would not do so should be compelled to undergo a longer term of separation than their fellows. Many friends of my own hold that vaccination has been responsible for setting up a bad state of the blood and causing illness, and, although the medical testimony as to the value of vaccination is overwhelming, the objections of such persons should be considered. It would be too much to require every person on a ship to be vaccinated, whatever his opinions as to the value of vaccination. </para>

                    <para>.- My opposition to the clause is based on grounds which differ somewhat from those hitherto advanced. Experience goes to show that we should be acting unwisely if we gave to the port medical officers the powers conferred by the clause. I do not propose to discuss the merits or demerits of vaccination, admitting the balance of medical testimony to be in its favour. </para>

                <para class="block">But this clause, if passed, will be put into operation when some outbreak of disease occurs, and at such times, I have noticed that medical men become seized with panic, just as does the general community. I have a vivid recollection of an occasion when there was an outbreak of bubonic plague in Australia. I was a passenger by a German mail steamer proceeding from Adelaide to Fremantle. Several Inter-State steamers had been allowed to enter Fremantle without being quarantined, as had also the English mail steamer. But on the voyage to Adelaide, a fireman on the German liner developed a trifling skin disease, and, as it was suspected that he was suffering from bubonic plague, he was put on shore at that port. The vessel resumed her voyage, and on her arrival at Fremantle, a juvenile, about twenty-four or twenty-five years of age, enveloped in an over-ail, boarded the ship and ordered all the Inter-State passengers into quarantine, without subjecting them to anything in the nature of an examination. As a matter of fact, he did not even see the passengers whom he ordered into quarantine. The man who was supposed to be suffering from the disease was put ashore at Adelaide, and it subsequently transpired, was not suffering&#39; from bubonic plague. The youth to whom I have referred, probably fresh from some university, ordered all the passengers to be put ashore in the ship&#39;s boats. The result was that we were landed in the middle of the night upon what was practically an uninhabited headland, where we had to find accommodation as best we could. For ten days some fifty or sixty persons were thus kept in quarantine, without rhyme or reason, until news was received from Adelaide that the fireman, upon whose account we had been quarantined, had been discharged. The doctor who ordered us into quarantine would have kept us there longer, had not the passengers held a meeting, at which they resolved to leave &#39; the quarantine grounds and walk into Fremantle. I happened to be  chairman  of the meeting, and it was resolved that all the male passengers should walk into Fremantle .and surrender themselves at the police-station. When the doctor learned of our decision, he released us from quarantine. I may say that at the quarantine station there was just a piece of galvanized iron between myself and a Chinese who was suffering from leprosy. The quarantine was an absolute farce. The authorities talk about the isolation of the patients, when, as a matter of fact, the baker&#39;s and butcher&#39;s carts were permitted to come into the grounds daily, and we were allowed to freely mingle with the drivers. It was nothing short of compulsory imprisonment to which we we&#39;re subjected, at the whim of a bumptious juvenile, who did not know his business. I am satisfied that we shall be doing a great wrong if we allow this clause to be incorporated in the Bill. I am&#62; glad the honorable member for Hunter has called attention to it, and I hope that he will insist upon a division, so that it may be eliminated. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that this clause is very roughly drawn, although I do not agree with all the criticisms which have been levelled against it. To my mind, its weakness, lies in the fact that it does not differentiate between the different diseases against which vaccination or inoculation is intended to be used. I think that vaccination as a preventive against small-pox - and I speak only on the authority of the balance of medical testimony - is extremely valuable, and I would be prepared to agree to the clause in its present form if it merely conferred powers of vaccination in the case of an outbreak of small-pox. But I find that the power of vaccination or inoculation is directed against any &#34; quarantinable disease &#34; and &#39; &#39; quarantinable disease &#34; means &#34; small-pox, plague, cholera, yellow fever, typhus fever, or leprosy.&#34; Accordingly, if a medical officer were to exceed his powers in the way that has been described by the honorable member for Coolgardie, he could compel any passenger to undergo inoculation against leprosy, typhus fever, yellow fever, or cholera. Whilst I would cheerfully submit to vaccination as a precautionary measure against small-pox every time that I was going to an Eastern country, I should be very sorry to be vaccinated against typhus fever or leprosy. The clause is so loosely drafted that, in the interests of the measure itself, the Attorney-General would be well advised if he agreed to its postponement. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not intend to discuss the merits or demerits of vaccination, but, to my mind, it is a great pity that this clause has been introduced into the Bill. The question of the utility of vaccination is one upon which there is a great difference of opinion. In Victoria, compulsory vaccination exists so far- as infants are concerned, but even in this State we have not gone so far as the proposal in this Bill. We do not compel people who are ordered into quarantine to be vaccinated. They can either be vaccinated - in which case they are detained for a shorter term - or they may refuse to be vaccinated - in &#34;which case they are obliged to remain in detention for a longer term. It appears to me that that is the remedy we ought to apply here. We should then permit those who have no objection to vaccination to be inoculated, while we should respect the scruples of others. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that this clause should either be mandatory or else excised from the BUI. Already different laws relating to vaccination are in operation in the various States. If a ship were quarantined in New South Wales, the probability is that the quarantine officer would not compel her passengers to be vaccinated. In Victoria,&#39; however, he might adopt a different course. I fail to see very much use in the provision. If it is held that because a person has been on a ship with persons suffering from a disease he might contract the disease after getting out of quarantine, and ought, therefore, to be vaccinated, by the same process of reasoning, vaccination should be made compulsory in the case of every one entering -the country. I have not heard that proposal suggested, and I am inclined to think it would meet with very strong opposition. If those who have been on a ship on which there has been disease, contract the disease after leaving the vessel, we have ample provision in the States and Commonwealth laws to deal with them, and to safeguard the health of the people generally. The preponderance of medical opinion is in favour of vaccination, but there is a great difference of opinion on the question, and it is generally admitted that vaccination &#34;is not a preventative of disease. It may insure a mild attack, but it is also admitted that to be effective, it is necessary that a person should be vaccinated every few years. In all the circumstances I think it would be better to strike the clause out. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. MATHEWS</inline>(Melbourne Ports)  t3-I3&#93;-  - I do hope that the fate of the clause will be decided on its merits or demerits, not by honorable members generally, but by those who have a professional acquaintance with the subject. I do not suppose there are more than two or three members of the Committee who can speak with authority as to the&#34; effects of inoculation. As the question is one in which I am not well versed, I am prepared to let it be decided by members of the medical profession. I hope that there will be no unnecessary delay in .dealing with the Bill, because we should get to work on more important business. I assume that in the preparation of this measure the Minister had the advice of medical men well versed in these questions. We have men in Australia who know something about them, and my vote will be cast in favour of the clause, in the belief that it is submitted on the advice of medical men. If that course is not generally adopted, it would be better to postpone the consideration of the clause until we have evidence as to the efficiency of inoculation in the prevention of the spread of disease. I am one of those who believe that the time will arrive when diseases of almost every kind will, by various means, be prevented; and it seems to me that that is likely to be brought about by a&#39; system of inoculation. </para>

                    <para>.- In order to give effect to the idea I put before the Committee, I suggest the amendment of the clause by the insertion after the word &#34;may,&#34; of the words &#34;but only with the consent of the person concerned.&#34; The question whether vaccination is or is not a good thing, does not enter into the discussion. The question here is whether we should make it compulsory for men to be .vaccinated who do not desire to be. No one will say that we could not obtain what we wish to accomplish by quarantine and separation of the persons concerned. If a man does not desire to be vaccinated he could be detained for such time as would make it certain that he would be under no risk of contracting the disease himself, and, therefore, of communicating it to others. That is all we need to secure under a quarantine Bill. Our object is to insure the safety of the people, and if it might be insured in that way, I do not see why we should enforce compulsory vaccination. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; and if we had more clean backyards there would be less danger of the spread of smallpox, and -other diseases. After all, the remedy is not so much in inoculation as in cleanliness in every thing. So far as my reading on the subject has gone, I am compelled to admit that the balance qf medical testimony is in favour of the contention that persons who have been vaccinated, if they contract a disease, suffer from it in only a modified form. Yet there is very strong and conscientious objection by very many people to being vaccinated at all. That is why I wish to make the clause optional. </para>

                    <para>. - Whilst I think that the clause might be improved, I do not agree with the amendment suggested by the honorable member for Nepean. If that were accepted, we might just as well strike out the clause. I can understand Australians objecting to vaccination, because they have not been witnesses of the ravages of the small-pox scourge. If they had lived, as I did in my younger days, in a big manufacturing city, and saw persons dying of small-pox by hundreds, and those who recovered disfigured in a dreadful manner, it is possible they would have a different opinion on the question of vaccination. I find no fault with a conscientious objection in regard to anything so long as the observance of such scruples, does not involve danger to the community. The power required under the Bill is not to. vaccinate all and sundry when there is no danger. It is when danger to the community is at hand that the power asked for is required for public protection. It ought not to be forgotten that in these days we have leviathans carrying a population equivalent to that of a village or small town. In these circumstances the danger of the spread of an infectious disease is a very serious matter. </para>

                <para>While the honorable member for Nepean was referring to vaccination for small-pox in New South Wales, I heard an honorable member ask whether the authorities compelled people to have a bath. A good many people have conscientious objections to taking a bath, but no honorable member would say that it would not be good for them to have one. I am quite sure that the honorable member for Nepean would not like to live in the same room in summer time with a man who had conscientious objections to taking a bath. He might not object in the colder weather, but as soon as the proximity of the person become obnoxious the honorable member would insist upon the bath being taken. I should like to see the clause amended in the direction suggested by the honorable member for Kooyong, but, of course, that would mean the complete isolation in the quarantine ground of all persons who bad conscientious objections. Taking everything into consideration it would be better to carry the clause as it stands rather than run any risk. </para>

                    <para>. - I quite realize that the feeling of the Committee is that the operation of the clause, if possible, should be confined to cases of small-pox. In practice it would, I think, be so confined, because I cannot conceive of vaccination for other diseases being required under present circumstances. But medical science does prescribe inoculation for other diseases, some of which may be more serious than small-pox. Inoculation, for. instance, is recommended for the prevention of plague. That is the reason why, later on, I propose to move an amendment in regard not only to inoculation but similar preventive measures against quarantinable diseases. The object in view is not to use the power in an arbitrary manner. It must be realized that when a case of small-pox is found on board a steamer, if the passengers were not vaccinated it would mean that every one connected with the ship would have to be detained very much longer than would otherwise be the case. One of the objects of the clause is to enable persons to be liberated as soon as possible. There is no danger of any officer exercising these powers unless thoroughly satisfied of an outbreak of small-pox. The honorable member for Coolgardie has mentioned what appears to be an arbitrary instance. It is all very well to criticise the health officer in the case mentioned, but suppose there had been some disease. I&#39; can quite understand an officer who had at heart the welfare of the community determining to take the safest course under the circumstances. It is just as well to be cautious in cases which may involve the lives of thousands of persons. Tha question of compulsory Vaccination throughout the Commonwealth is not before the Committee in any way. The clause relates to a specific instance. If a ship is coming in, and there is small-pox on board, we want to give the officer power to say, if he considers it necessary to prevent the spread of disease, that what the clause requires shall be done. What would be the alternative ? It would mean that every per, son who had not&#39; been vaccinated would be detained in quarantine very much longer. </para>

                    <para>.- I have been misrepresented by the honorable member for Laanecoorie, who declared that I had distinctly said that I did not believe vaccination was of service as a preventive against the spread of small-pox. I made no such statement. I was careful to say that I would express no opinion on the subject. I believe that the consensus of medical opinion- to-day is that it would be well if the whole community were vaccinated. , I do not dispute that opinion, but I object to any medical officer being empowered to board a ship and to order that the passengers, whether suffering from small-pox or anything else, shall be vaccinated with lymph of any kind. For that reason, I intend to vote against this clause. Those passengers who are quarantined can do no harm to the health of the general public, and it should be for them to decide whether they shall be vaccinated or not. The Minister has said that the mere fact of a person in quarantine being vaccinated would prevent him from taking the disease. He must be aware, however, that there is a period of incubation during which the disease is lying latent in the body of the patient, and no one can say whether or not he has taken it. The vaccination of a person in whom the disease of small-pox is latent would not prevent the development of that disease. I doubt very much whether the vaccination of a person who had already contracted the disease would cause the attack to be less serious than it would otherwise be. I fail to see why any persons should be compelled to submit themselves to the operation. I should object to be vaccinated without my consent. I think it would be an undue interference with the liberty of the subject to insist that a man should be vaccinated when the object in view could be just as well attained&#39; by insisting that he should remain in quarantine. The time will come, I believe, when people will not be quarantined as at present in Australia. I believe we shall yet adopt the practice of the United States of America, where passengers on vessels arriving from infected ports are examined, and whilst those who are found to be suffering from an infectious disease are. detained, those who are healthy are allowed to depart, but are kept under observation for a certain time. </para>

                        <para>- They would be kept under observation for a certain period in their own homes; they would be quarantined there. The same practice has been adopted in connexion with the occurrence of plague in New South Wales. In the first instance, many &#34; contacts &#34; were removed from their homes, and sent to the quarantine station, but later on it was found quite sufficient to keep such persons tinder observation in their own homes. In the United States of America, there are ports where dozens of vessels might arrive from an infected port within a very short space of time, and if the ordinary Australian system were followed 10,000 or 15,000 persons might be quarantined within a few days. </para>

Until the Committee is given the fullest information, or the Minister is able to satisfy us that he has taken competent scientific advice, we ought not to agree to his proposal. </para>

                    <para>.- Will the Acting Prime Minister indicate the intentions of the Government regarding collections made pursuant to the Tariff, as tabled last night, under duties which may subsequently be reduced? The matter is of moment to many importers. We are at present at the change of the seasons, and the uncertainty is dislocating trade considerably. I hope the honorable gentleman&#39;s answer will be that any money collected under duties which are subsequently reduced by Parliament will be refunded. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. JOSEPH</inline>COOK (Parramatta) &#163;3.58&#93;. - Is the Acting Prime Minister able to say definitely when the debate on the Budget will be resumed? &#34;It is a very strange proceeding on the part of the Government to attempt to delay unnecessarily the consideration of the Budget once it has been submitted to the House. It has always been the rule for the Government to accede most tardily to the request of the Opposition for an adjournment of sufficient length to enable them to consider the financial proposals of the Government. In this case the position is entirely reversed. We are anxious to go on with the consideration of the Budget, so as to make way for the consideration of the Tariff, but the Government seem to be delaying the matter unnecessarily, and without the slightest justification. It is all very well for the Acting Prime Minister to say, as lie does, that the Tariff and the Budget proposals are inseparably linked together. They are not, except so far as regards the amount of revenue likely to be derived under the Tariff. In considering the Budget, we shall have no need to refer to the Tariff, except from the point of view as to how the Tariff will affect the probable revenue for the current year. There appears to be no reason whatever for delaying the consideration of the Budget. To do so will simply delay the consideration of the Tariff. It would conserve the time of the House to take the Budget discussion as soon as possible. When dealing with the Budget, we shall not consider the Tariff in any detail, or even as to its principles. They should be kept as distinct as possible. The Government should allow the consideration of the Budget to come on next Wednesday, as already decided, and not postpone it in the way the Minister contemplates. Does the Minister mean us to infer that there will not be a general discussion on the Tariff, when we come to deal with the schedule? I protest against this dallying on the part of the Government, particularly with the consideration of the Budget. It is quite evident to me that we should not have seen the Tariff for some time, if the importers had not begun to force&#39; the Minister&#39;s hand. The Tariff was brought down in a hurry by the honorable gentleman, who knew nothing about it. He had not had time in which to master its details, as he had to confess on the floor of the House. </para>

                    <para>- My honorable friend made it so thoroughly that he knew nothing about it. He could impart no information to us. For instance, he could . not tell us what the bounty, proposals were. We do not know yet what they are to be. We have had no indication on that point. I am surprised at the Minister smiling. The amount of the bounty may be a very small consideration with him. But, in view of the limit which we have reached in our spendings, I venture* to say that it is a very serious consideration with the country at large. I am surprised at the honorable gentleman smiling at so important a matter. However, his smiles ought not to deter us from&#39; asking the Ministry to proceed with the consideration of the Budget proposals at the earliest possible moment. What is to hinder that? I protest against this attempt to play with legislation!, which seems to h&#39;ave characterized the Government ever since the House assembled. The sooner the Budget is .disposed of the sooner will the way be open for a fair and full consideration of the Tariff. </para>

                    <para>.- I quite agree with the honorable member that we ought to get to the discussion of the Budget at the earliest possible moment, but I think that when he expresses an entire inability to understand what reason can be actuating the Minister in declining to separate the discussions on the Budget and the Tariff, he is showing a certain amount of political innocence with which I should not have credited him. I find that the Minister is in rather a tight corner. He is very anxious to have a lengthy discussion on the Tariff ; but &#39;he is not anxious to have other matters of policy discussed. He and his small party are supported here by a large party, whose main interest at the present time is the establishment of a Federal system of old-age pensions. The Acting Prime Minister has told us that he is not going to give them what they want. </para>

                    <para>. -  The honorable member for Kooyong has asked a question regarding the return of money collected, if any increases of duties are not approved. In such cases the money was not returned on the last occasion, and the same procedure will be followed in the present instance. The Bill will contain a provision to that effect. It would be almost impossible to carry out the honorable member&#39;s view. It could only be done in the case of unbroken packages, because, as he will see, it would be quite impossible to trace any goods which had been sold by the importers. For that reason, it is not intended to return any money which has been collected. In reply to the honorable member for Herbert, I desire to say that I have received from the managing director of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, a letter stating that they have imported  341  men under their permits, but do not intend to use any more of the permits. Therefore, the permits will be cancelled. I think that the deputy leader of the Opposition must have had his tongue in his cheek when he was speaking just now. </para>

                        <para>- It rests entirely with honorable members to say whether the general discussion on the Tariff and the Budget shall be taken together or separately. It is. not likely, in fact, it is hardly possible that they can discuss the Budget without discussing the Tariff. I think it will save time to have one general discussion, because otherwise we should have a discussion on the Budget, and then a repetition of it on the Tariff. </para>

The figures used will afford the opportunity ; indeed, they cannot be referred to unless the whole question is dealt with. The Budget papers, which are very voluminous, must also be printed. If all the information required is not complete and available when we come to discuss the Budget and Tariff, honorable members will blame me. But before that discussion takes place, I wish to get rid of several measures now on the business-paper. My principle is to deal with one measure at a time, and not let its consideration be side-tracked to bring another matter forward, unless it is absolutely necessary to do that.

In one of this morning&#39;s journals is a statement which leads me to suppose that some of my remarks on the Budget last night may be misunderstood. I am supposed to have said that, when at the Conference in London, the Prime Minister and myself made offers equivalent to a bribe, promising that if Great Britain would give a preference to Australia, we, on our return, would do what we could to bring about the granting of preference by Australia to Great Britain. I did not make any statement of the kind. What I said was that in London I had stated - and I think the Prime Minister did so, too - that if we did not get all that we wanted, we should not resent our. treatment, but should propose a preferential Tariff for the advantage- of Great Britain, leaving it open to the British Government, if it liked, hereafter to give consideration to Australia. </para>
