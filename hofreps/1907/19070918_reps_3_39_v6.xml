It is a petition in reference to the Tariff. </para>

                        <para>- No; against the Tariff, and it refers also to the duty on wire netting. It would appear to have been signed by Alfred Deakin, Harry Foran, myself, and a number of others whom I do not know. I should like to direct the attention of the House to this example of the manner in which some petitions are prepared. </para>

                        <para>- It is impossible for me, before perusing the petition, to determine the issue stated by the Minister. If there are attached to it signatures which are forgeries, and others which may or may not be so, it is competent for the House to receive it or not as it pleases. If the Minister moves that it be received, I shall put that question. </para>

                        <para>-  I take the point that the Acting Prime Minister had no right to present the petition, because, under the Standing Orders, the member presenting a petition must certify that it is in order, which means, amongst other things, that there are no forgeries in it, that it contains nothing offensive, and that it concludes with a prayer. I understood that the honorable gentleman was addressing you on a question of privilege, because a person who forges a signature to a petition to this House is guilty of a breach of the privileges of the House. I submit that it was improper for the petition to be presented without the certificate of the Minister that it is in order. If a petition doss not bear that certificate, an honorable member cannot present it, and the House cannot receive it. </para>

                        <para>-  It seems to me that the question which should be asked is whether the Acting Prime Minister is prepared to say that certain signatures, bearing the names of well-known public men, are forgeries. If  he  is, I take it that  he  will not be in order in presenting the petition; but if  he  is not, I fail to see how the House can reasonably Be expected to come to a determination in regard to, the matter. </para>

                        <para>-The Minister, in presenting the petition, mentioned that it was similar to one presented a fortnight ago. If this  be  a copy of that petition, which was in order, it must also be in order, being respectfully worded, and concluding with a prayer. But  he  also raised  the  question whether certain signatures attached to it are genuine. I  see  that some of the signatures which  he  mentioned have been struck .out, .and therefore do not appear on the petition. </para>

                        <para>- The signature of the Prime Minister may, or may not, have been attached to the petition by him, though I think it probable that it was not. How-, ever, that is  a  matter of which the House or I can have no knowledge until it has been inquired into. The Minister has  a  perfect right to present a petition which  is  respectfully worded and contains  a  prayer; but I think it was proper for him to warn the House in regard to certain facts relating  to  it. I  see no  reason why the motion, that the petition  be  received should not  be  put, for the House to agree, to  or  reject,  as  honorable members may think lit. </para>

                        <para>- I should like to call attention to this phase of the question : It would be possible for any person to nullify any properly prepared petition if the fact that all the names attached to a. petition are not genuine is to be a ground for rejecting it. Is it fair, because of the wrong-doing of persons into whose hands the petition has fallen, to punish those who have signed it in good faith ? </para>

                        <para>- I rise to make a personal explanation. Last night the Acting Prime Minister charged me with having made some statements which were absolutely incorrect concerning something which he had said about the Premier of New South Wales. I understood the Acting Prime Minister to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers</inline> had increased the expenditure of New South Wales to the extent of &#163;2,000,000 while he had been Premier. When, later on, I attempted to prove that that was not the case, by quoting the actual figures, the Acting Prime Minister indignantly denied that he had made any such statement ; and his denial, of course was accompanied by the cheers of honorable members opposite. So indignant were his denials that I thought at one time he was likely to take a fit.

                        <para>.- By way of personal explanation, I desire to say that I have not yet seen the copy of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> to which the honorable member has referred. I do not know what were the exact words that I used, but if I made the interjection quoted by the honorable member, I followed it up with a statement to the effect that the expenditure of New South Wales had increased by over &#163;2,000,000 since the establishment of Federation. I quoted figures in support of my contention. I think that if the honorable member will read the report of the speech made by me in reply he will find that I said that from the inception of Federation up to the present period the expenditure of New South Wales had increased by over &#163;2,000,000. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think they can possibly come within the category of legal forgery, and even if they did we could, as a House, deal with them. It is not for the Attorney-General to take action ; it is for this House to deal with a breach of privilege on the part of a man who sends in a petition to which a signature has been attached without authority. We can appoint a Committee to inquire into the matter. We do not need to ask the Government or the Attorney-General to discharge the functions of a Committee of this House in the way proposed by the honorable member. On that ground, therefore, I object to the motion. It should be amended to provide for the petition being referred to a Committee of the House for report. I may be wrong, but that is the position I take up. I would also point out that the petition, so far as the signatures to it are concerned, is perfectly valid. The question of forgery has a significance in relation only to the signature alleged to be forged. All the other signatures are properly on the petition, and it is properly before the House. </para>

                            <para>- One of the greatest privileges enjoyed by British subjects is the right to petition Parliament, and I feel that that right would be abused if we allowed such a proceeding as has taken place this afternoon to be repeated. On other occasions I have taken exception to petitions containing mis-statements being presented to this House, and I feel that we should not be doing our duty to the country, or to that great House which we endeavour to follow, if we were to allow the right of petition to become the sport and plaything of parties. </para>

                            <para>- Then that is an evidence of the genuineness of the petition. In every public petition - no matter what its object may be - there appear signatures which have been attached without authority, perhaps by boys or other irresponsible persons, who are fond of a practical joke. The fact that such signatures have been appended to a petition, however, does not vitiate it. We have to remember that a letter from a well-known firm of solicitors accompanies the petition now under discussion, and that  there are attached to it many names which must be well known to the Acting Prime Minister. </para>

                            <para>- Order. I must ask the House to permit honorable members to make their speeches as they please, and, if they desire to raise a point of order, to address it to the Chair. The reply about to be made to an honorable member by the  Speaker  should not be anticipated, and there should be no attempt to prevent any honorable member from expressing his own views. If we are not careful in this regard we shall lose the right of speech by individual honorable members. Every honorable member, so long as he does not transgress a standing order, has a right to say what he pleases. He is not to be limited or confined to a statement of what others may desire him to say. I therefore ask honorable members to allow every honorable member to make his own speech according to his own plan, and not to try to compel him to say that which they desire. </para>

                        <para>. - I earnestly hope that honorable members will see that proper steps are taken to guard one of our most important privileges and the right of the citizens of the Commonwealth to approach this House by petition. It seems to me that the question which has now been brought so prominently under our notice involves a very important principle. Quite apart from any insult which may be offered to the House by the presentation of a bogus petition, we should insist upon conserving our rights and privileges. If we cannot rely implicitly upon the genuineness of the petitions which are presented to us from time to time I am afraid that we shall have to look very much closer into those documents than we have been accustomed to do. The petition presented by the Acting Prime Minister differs from many petition&#39;s presented to this House. In most cases it is quite impossible to analyze the signatures attached to these documents, but from my personal knowledge I am convinced that at least one signature to the petition under consideration is not genuine. </para>

                        <para>- I am of opinion that the honorable member for Laanecoorie has made a mistake in moving for the appointment of a Committee of the House to investigate the genuineness of the petition. The matter ought really to be investigated in the first instance by the Attorney-General. If the results of his inquiries lead him to believe that forgery has been committed, and that the offence can be sheeted home to the guilty parties, it will then be proper for this House to take action. What would the Printing or any other Committee do in the matter? That body would have to employ the Attorney-General&#39;s Department to undertake the work of investigation for them. Let us suppose that the honorable member for Kooyong, who is so familiar with the signature of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harry</inline> Foran, of the Domain, Sydney, is convinced that&#39; the signature purporting to be his is not genuine. How can he establish that it is a forgery ? The honorable member for Kooyong would be called upon to prove that there is no other Harry Foran in Australia. He would have to produce the Harry Foran whom he knows so well, and also a number of other Harry Forans, in order to prove that the signature attached to the petition is not theirs. </para>

It is utterly absurd for that honorable member to urge that I am converting a serious business into a farce. I repeat that in order to establish the fact that the signature of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harry</inline> Foran which is attached to the petition is not genuine it would be necessary to produce every Harry Foran within the Commonwealth. When it has been proved that the signatures to the petition are forgeries it will be time enough for a Committee of this House to act. I support the proposal of the honorable member for Hindmarsh, because its adoption will probably lead to the discovery of the persons who - if they have forged <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harry</inline> Foran&#39;s signature - ought to be punished. </para>

But I would point out that probably there is more than one Alfred Deakin.

                        <para>.- The trouble in connexion with this petition has arisen from the way in which the Acting Prime Minister introduced it. At the outset he awakened the fiscal proclivities of honorable members, and apparently they have not been able to escape from them since. I take it that the Acting Prime Minister ha.d a duty to perform before he presented the petition to the House.  His  duty was to examine the document and satisfy himself as to the <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> of its signatories. If he entertained any reasonable doubt of their <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> he should have referred the petition back to the persons who sent it to him, with a request that it should be corrected. But instead of doing that, he brought the matter forward in a way that was undoubtedly calculated to inflame the minds of honorable members in regard to the fiscal meaning of the petition. The position appears to me to be a very simple one. Nobody suggests that the whole of the signatures to the petition are forgeries. It seems to be generally recognised that a number of them are perfectly <inline font-style="italic">bona fide,</inline> and it is monstrous that those who have signed the petition in good faith should now find it proposed to be thrown under the table simply because one or two individuals, with no sense of responsibility, and with only a weak sense of humour, which I regret to say has been reflected in this House to-day, chose to attach certain names to it apparently by way of a joke. The right to petition Parliament is a very important one, and I hope that this House will hesitate before it interferes with that undoubted right of the people of the Commonwealth. The petition appears to contain a number of names which are forgeries. If honorable members are satisfied that that is so, it is their privilege to lodge a complaint with the Attorney-General, and it is his business to follow the matter up. But, if we admit the genuineness of the petition as a whole, then the House cannot refuse to accept it. </para>

                            <para>- So far as the document as a whole is concerned, there is no doubt that it is. But I have heard from many persons that there is a number of names attached to the petition which are not genuine, arid that some of the signatories did not know what they were signing. When I saw my own name attached to it I thought that the matter was being carried a little too far. I am satisfied that some of the persons whose names are attached to the petition did not sign it, and that others who did sign it did not know what they were signing. </para>

                            <para>- I did not happen to be there. I know, as a matter of fact, that the petition was got up ih a manner in which it should not have been got up. I could mention the name of the gentleman who was the main instrument in getting it up ; it is attached to the petition. He is a reputable man living near junee. I could not refuse to present the petition; but I should not have been doing my duty had I not directed the attention of the House to the fact that attached to it are signatures which I know not to be genuine. There may be many others besides those which I mentioned which are not genuine. I am quite aware that petitions are presented to the House which in their essence are not <inline font-style="italic">bona fide,</inline> because persons sign them without knowing their contents. Numbers of those who signed this petition did not know what they were signing, and they told me so. I do not think that any blame attaches to me for presenting a petition sent to me from my constituency by a gentleman who signed it, and who, I know, acted <inline font-style="italic">bona fide.</inline> But, on the other hand, I was justified in pointing out that some of the signatures attached to it are not <inline font-style="italic">bond fide.</inline> In informing the House of the nature of the petition, I did not say a word against those who had signed <inline font-style="italic">bona fide,</inline> and with the best intentions. I understand that the petition was placed in charge of some one who asked those passing in and out of the show gates to sign it, and that many of those who signed did not take the trouble to read it. It is not right that petitions signed in that way should be allowed to sway this House. Persons signing petitions should know what they are signing, and the petitions should be <inline font-style="italic">bona fide.</inline> I complain that petitions are presented&#39; which are not <inline font-style="italic">bond fide.</inline> I think that honorable members generally are of opinion that it was my duty to direct attention to signatures attached to the petition which I knew not to be genuine. I could not undertake the responsibility of striking them out. </para>

                            <para>- I made very little fuss about it ; it is the House that has made a fuss about it. Using  very  calm language, I directed attention to the weak spot of the petition. I was not excited, nor am I now. It is the House which has taken the matter up. I should have been blameworthy had I refused to present a petition sent to me from Wagga by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Mitchelmore,  or had I struck out signatures attached to it. </para>

                        <para>.- The discussion seems to have centred upon the question whether petitions should be received, irrespective of what they contain. I agree with those who assert that the right to petition Parliament is one of the greatest rights possessed by the people ; but that right may be destroyed if &#34;it is abused or allowed to be tainted at the source. Once it comes to the knowledge of honorable members that a petition is tainted at the source, the statements contained in it cease to influence them. </para>

                            <para>- Every legislative chamber has laid down the rule that petitions must conform in certain respects to what is thought to be proper, and that otherwise they shall not be received. I do not agree with what the Acting Prime Minister has said in regard to the manner in which this petition was signed. We have nothing to do with that. What we are concerned with is whether a petition is respectfully worded and complies with the Standing Orders, and whether the signatures attached to it are genuine. With the knowledge that we have of some of the signatures attached to this petition, can there be any doubt that in some respects it is not <inline font-style="italic">bona fide?</inline></para>

                            <para>- The point which I wish to emphasize is that if petitions are tainted at their source they cease to be of value. If an investigation proves that persons have wilfully forged signatures to a petition, they should be punished by the Law Courts. It is the duty of every self-respecting Chamber of Legislature to see that the right of petition, which is one of the chief privileges of the people, is not abused for party purposes. </para>

                            <para>- He described how certain signatures were obtained, and from his description it was natural to infer that at the Wagga show he had seen persons signing the petition. At any rate, he has told us that there are signatures attached to it which are genuine, and I maintain that if one signature is genuine, the petition must be regarded as genuine, although there may be a number of other signatures which are not genuine, signed, perhaps, by some wag possessing a peculiar sense of humour. I maintain that a petition to which one genuine signature is attached should be received as a genuine petition. From what the Acting Prime Minister said, there seems to be no doubt in his own mind as to the genuineness of this petition, although he takes exception to the manner in which signatures were obtained to it. Under the circumstances there is no need for further action by the House. </para>

                        <para>- It seems to me that the honorable member for Lang misses the point of the objection to this petition, which is that a right which British communities have long enjoyed has, in this instance, been apparently abused, and if notice is not taken of the matter, it will tend to bring the practice of petitioning Parliament into still greater disrepute than it is in at the present time. </para>

                            <para>- No. The methods adopted to obtain signatures to petitions are so loose and open to abuse of every kind that petitions have practically ceased to be of any value, so far as influencing Parliament in regard to matters of policy is concerned, and, on being received, are practically thrown into the waste-paper basket, no one taking any notice of their contents. Of course, attention is paid to the petitions of private individuals praying for the redress of grievances ; but it would be preposterous to expect members of Parliament to depart from fiscal principles to which they were pledged, merely because of the presentation of a petition signed by Brown, Jones, and Robinson, praying the House to adopt a certain policy. The petitioning of Parliament has come to be an absolute farce, except when individual grievances are concerned. In my opinion, honorable members should not consider -themselves bound to present petitions merely because they have been forwarded to them from their electorates, and I think that the Acting Prime Minister should not have presented this petition, seeing that he knew it to be improperly signed. If any one sent me a petition from my electorate, in connexion with which I could easily discover some fraud, I should regard it as an act of discourtesy, and should return it, with the intimation that I would not present a petition which was not in proper form. </para>

Those who get up petitions should insure, as far as possible, that abuses do not occur. As to the motion before the Chair, I have no objection to an inquiry. Personally, I do not think that it will achieve very much; but if it brings home to the public the fact that Parliament is not inclined to allow petitioning to become a farce, it will do a certain amount of good. </para>

I think that when, in future, petitions are presented to this House, not only should they be read, but the names and addresses of those signing should also be read. In a great many cases such a course would disclose the fact that a number of signatures had not been authorized by the persons whose names they bore. </para>

Every member has the right to express his opinion and give reasons for his vote; and one member has openly said to-day that he will vote in favour of the request of the petition because it is a free-trade petition. There is nothing wrong in such an attitude; but I desire to give one instance to prove that we should do right on the present occasion to decide on an investigation. Not long since a petition was presented from my electorate, as the honorable member for South Sydney said, behind my back. That petition possessed great interest for certain persons, but everything in connexion with it was, for certain reasons, kept as quiet as possible. However, I went to the Minister, to whom the petition had been sent, and, having obtained a copy, together with the names, </para>

                    <para class="block">I made some inquiries on my own account. The result was that in six cases out of ten I found that the signatures were absolute forgeries, while, in the case of the other signatures, I found that the electors had had. placed before them two petitions with directly opposite objects. If the elector proved not to be a true party man, be was asked to sign the second petition ; and the facts disclosed a grave state of affairs. We desire to be approached by petition, but petitions must be genuine. In the face of what has occurred to-day, can we in the future place any reliance on petitions which may be presented to us? I shall support the motion in order that there may be the fullest investigation, and in the future I shall endeavour to have our rules so amended&#39; as to permit of the publication of the petitions and signatures, in order that those whose names have been forged may have redress. </para>

                        <para>On Friday last, the13th instant, there appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> a short article on the New Hebrides, which from its wording might be thought to have emanated from the Foreign Missions Committee of our Church, or from some one in authority in our Church. We have been requested by the Foreign Missions Committee, which met to-day, to write and state that the Committee knows nothing of it - does not indorse it, and is at a loss to think who could have inspired it, as it is contrary to the facts of the case. We have pleasure in acknowledging that the Prime Minister, the Honorable Alfred Deakin, has done what he could to help our interests in the Islands, and the statement that the Federal Government declined to send on any document for us to the Colonial Office is without foundation, the fact being that at the request of our Committee the Department for External Affairs did send home what we asked, and met us in the most friendly spirit. </para>

                    <para>-I desire to make a brief personal explanation. On Thursday last, on the authority of the Treasury officials, I made a statement showing the expenditure of the States out of revenue since Federation, and I gave the totals under the various headings as supplied to me. I understand, however, that the Treasury officials subsequently found that the figures supplied to me were not quite up-to-date, and they sent a corrected return, which was inserted in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> The effect is that the totals which I quoted do not agree  with the totals in the tabulated statement appearing in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> I understand from the Chief Parliamentary Reporter that alterations will be made in the second edition and the permanent volume, with the object of making my totals correspond with the totals given in the tabulated statement; but I find it necessary to make this explanation in case it may appear to any person reading the temporary issue of the record that I was so careless as to quote incorrect figures. I .should like to also add that, according to the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of to-day, the Premier of Western Australia has ventured to cast some ridicule on the figures which I gave as showing the gain to Western Australia since the Federal Tariff came into operation.  His  remarks were apparently evoked by the fact that a meeting of protectionists at Perth recently used my figures to discount the inventions of the State Actuary concerning the Tariff. The  honorable gentleman said that the  chairman  of the public meeting repeated &#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mahon&#39;s</inline> absurd statement that the State had gained ^2,240,000 on account of Federation.&#34; The Premier went on to say - </para>

                <quote>
                    <para>Surely <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mahon</inline> knew that the amount returned to the State was not a gift, but its own money made up of taxes, paid to the Custom House and the Excise Department by its own people. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">I wish to say that I never desired any such inference to be drawn from my remarks. The essence of my contention was, of course, not that this sum was a gift from the Commonwealth to the Federation, but that it represented the amount which the Federal Government had returned to the State out of the State&#39;s own contribution to the Customs and Excise. I referred to the return as a &#34; gain &#34; simply because the Actuary of Western Australia, on whom the Premier of that State is now relying, and who is placing exaggerated and fanciful Estimates before the people, referred to the fact that the Treasury deficiency which he anticipated from Federation would be a loss to the State. Seeing that there has been no loss in the sense of there&#39; being a deficiency. I referred to the amount received as a gain to the Treasury. The Premier of Western Australia, therefore, . is simply throwing ridicule on the State official when he attempts to challenge my figures. I desire to add, in reference to the tabulated statement to which I first referred, that I am of course very pleased to have up-to-date figures. Further, ft is only just to say that no person connected with either <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> or the Treasury can be held to be in any way blameable for the discrepancy between the figures. </para>

What I referred to, and what the newspaper report refers to, though the report is not accurate, is the thickness of the boards. Hitherto the surface of an inch board has been taken as the measurement ; but, in accordance with a footnote in the report of the Tariff Commission, the Customs officials have been charging for the surface, no matter how thin the boards are. What I said was that I did not think that was intended, and that I would ask the Minister of Trade and Customs to look into the matter, in order to see whether or not there was some error. That is what the newspaper report refers to, though the reporter has apparently not caught the point. </para>

                            <para>- I should like to ask the Acting Prime Minister a question relating to magazines. By way of explanation I may mention that last week, in Adelaide, and this week in Melbourne, it was pointed out to me that there were two pressing difficulties. One related to the giving of orders for the delivery of Christmas issues of magazines, and the other to the fact that if the merchants chose to take these imports without advertisements the staff in Adelaide would not be able to deliver the first clear of advertisements before the second mail de- livery would come round. I should like to ask the Acting Prime Minister whether, seeing that the wisest of Ministers could not frame a Tariff free from anomalies, he will agree to ask the Committee to deal at once with the item of magazines. </para>

                                <para>- This matter relates more particularly to the detailed work of the Minister of Trade and Customs, and, without consulting him, I could not reply to the honorable member&#39;s question. The policy of the Government, however, is that, as far as possible, the items shall be taken <inline font-style="italic">seriatim.</inline> If we once departed from that rule, then every honorable member would desire us to give precedence to certain items, and numerous difficulties and complications would arise. I should like precedence to be given to some items, but at present I can only say that the Government intend to deal with them <inline font-style="italic">seriatim.</inline> I regret very much that I cannot agree to the honorable member&#39;s request, and I am sure he will recognise that we should bring a hornet&#39;s nest about our ears if we departed from the course I have indicated. </para>

            <para>. - The total estimated cost of these stores will be .&#163;30,000, and this item represents part of the expenditure upon them. The land, which is alongside the Royal Navy Stores at Darling Island, has been acquired from the State Government for Commonwealth Storage Purposes, to take the place of premises at present rented. On the site is intended to be erected a plain steel-framed brick six-story building of fire-proof construction, 234 feet by 41 feet, where bulk goods for the Defence and Postmaster-General&#39;s Departments may be received, stored, and despatched from by either sea or rail . Modern quick-lifting and  carrying  machinery, suitable to the weights to be handled, is proposed to be provided-, in order that a minimum of time and labour may be utilized in transferring stores direct from the ship&#39;s tackle into the building and dispersing same by rail or <inline font-style="italic">vice versa.</inline></para>

            <para>- Included in these Estimates is an item &#163;1,565 for a post-office at Cloncurry, to which some exception has been taken by one or two honorable members. Cloncurry is in my electorate, and, although objection was taken to the item last night on the ground that the town is only a small one, I would point out that it is the centre of a very large district, and the chief distributing point for mail services to distant places. If other honorable members who are advocating the erection of postal buildings in their electorates can make out as good a case as we can do for this item, they will deserve success. The revenue of the Cloncurry post-office from postal matter alone last year was&#163;980, whilst the revenue from telegrams and telephones amounted to &#163;1,083, and the commission on money orders to &#163;99, making a total of&#163;2,162. The working expenses for the same period amounted to &#163;636, leaving a credit balance of &#163;1,526. It will thus be seen that the profits derived from one year&#39;s operations would pay for the erection of the new building. Cloncurry will probably be the centre of one of the largest mining districts in Australia. In mining circles generally it is regarded as the hope of Australia. </para>

              <para>- But the copper ores found there are of unparalleled richness, and it will be possible to work them at a profit when the ores of many other districts cannot be treated. Few honorable members have the slightest conception of the importance and the extent of this vast mineral belt of country. It is rich in copper and other minerals, and promises to be one of the greatest mining fields in Australia. Apart from the fact that an enormous sum is being expended on the mines in the neighbourhood of the town itself, we have to remember that a railway to Cloncurry will be completed within two or three months, and that it will then be the distributing centre for mining districts within a radius of from 150 to 200 miles. At the present time mails are being run from Cloncurry to Winton, towards Richmond, Normanton, Camooweal, Boulia, Mount Elliott, and other places. </para>

          <para>It is a large distributing centre. My complaint is that the Government have not made any effort to erect a permanent building there. The buildings which have been constructed from time to time have practically been eaten away by white ants. In localities where stone is available surely the post-offices should be constructed of that material. If we take into consideration the cost incurred in hauling the timber necessary for the construction of a post-office a distance of 500 miles by rail, and the cost of conveying it a considerable distance by boat, we must come to the conclusion that the expenditure involved in erecting a stone building would be very little more than that of erecting a wooden structure, whilst it would form a better asset to the Commonwealth. I may mention in this connexion that even cedar buildings have been erected in that portion of Queensland, because it is generally supposed that that class of timber is not attacked by white ants. </para>

              <para>- Yes. Probably the honorable member did not intend to make the statement, but, nevertheless, he did make it. He confined his remarks in that connexion to the Mosman district. From the information which I have received, it is not a fact that 30,000 tons of cane in that district had to stand over last year owing to the shortage of labour. It was not the scarcity of labour which led to that quantity of cane standing over, but the fact that sufficient crushing power was* not available to deal with it. As a matter of fact, there was ample labour available throughout the season. Despite the statements to the contrary which have been made from time to time by the owners of large sugar estates, it is a fact that numbers of men have sought employment in these places, and have been unable to obtain it. Further, since this Parliament enacted legislation for the abolition of kanaka labour in Queensland, these planters have stated, year after year, that they would be absolutely ruined because of their inability to obtain a sufficient supply of labour. But is it not a fact that to-day we are producing twice the quantity of sugar that we did prior to the enactment of that legislation? Is it not also a fact that the whole of the growers&#39; requirements, so far as labour is concerned, have been met? </para>

There is a certain class of planter in Queensland - the honorable member for Brisbane, who assisted to pass the Bill introduced into the Queensland Parliament by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith in 1884, which provided for the abolition of kanaka labour, knows him very well - who would move heaven and earth to retain cheap coloured labour.

              <para>- I know who finds all the money for electioneering purposes. I know who is behind the whole show in connexion with the party which runs the honorable member. .Before telling the Committee  that there was a shortage of labour in the cane-fields of Queensland, I think that the honorable member should have made himself more familiar with the actual position of affairs. He is well aware that the planters of that State - owing to their continuous outcry about) the scarcity of labour - have obtained permission from the Government to indenture a certain class of labour for work in the cane-fields. Not long since they imported a number of Spaniards for that purpose - men who cannot speak English, except the few words which they were&#39; able to pick up on the voyage to Australia. What has been the result? Nearly all these men have left their employment, and are now drifting about Queensland competing against those who are endeavoring to obtain a reasonable wage for the work which they perform. The foreigners are content to accept whatever wage they can get. I say that if immigrants of this class are to be brought to Australia under the auspices of the sugar planters, they will inevitably come into competition with workers engaged in other pursuits. I hope that the Government will take into their serious consideration the fact that these new arrivals are not fulfilling the agreement under which they were introduced. It is not a good thing to have them scattered all over the country. I had intended to speak upon <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> general financial policy of the Government, but I feel that there is no particular interest in the debate at the present moment, and consequently I do not propose to weary the Committee any further. In conclusion, I wish to assure the Treasurer that I am not at all satisfied with the general statements which have emanated from the Government in connexion with the financial position of the Commonwealth. </para>

          <para>Colonel FOXTON.- I am dealing now with a statement which I made upon a previous occasion. What I then said - and what I am reported to have said in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> - is correct so far as my information goes. It may be that there were other causes for this cane not having been cut, but upon that point the information supplied to the honorable member for Kennedy is entirely different from that which has been supplied to me. The fact remains that this quantity of cane did stand over. My object now is to show that the remarks of the honorable member as to the statement which he alleged I was reported to have made, are entirely wide of the mark. I am reported in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> to have said exactly what I intended to say. I am very glad to hear the voice of the honorable member for Kennedy, because as _  Chairman  he is to a certain extent muzzled ; but, unfortunately, on this, occasion he does not seem to have taken advantage of his opportunity with the best results, so far as the first item is concerned. As regards the second, he said that the party which desires to have cheap coloured labour for the North was the party behind me at the elections, and that it found the funds in connexion with my return to this Parliament. I do not know what authority he had for that statement, and I should like him to name any person or body pf persons in any way contributing funds which were used to bring about my return. I am under the painful impression that I paid all the expenses of my election. If he is aware of a secret fund which was employed to assist in securing my return, I shall be glad if he will inform me of the particulars concerning it. </para>

          <para>Colonel FOXTON.- That is a totally different statement. It certainly never entered my head, and I did not intend to convey, that the people of Queensland, or those connected with the sugar industry, favour the abolition of the bounty. I remember to have said that some of those interested are of opinion that if both bounty and Excise were abolished, thus again enabling cane-growers to employ coloured labour without penalty, it would be a good thing, while others are opposed to such a course, but that, in any event, it would be impossible by their abolition to place the Queensland sugar-grower on exactly the same financial footing as he occupied before the deportation of kanakas commenced, seeing that 4,000 or  5,000  of his skilled field labourers have been sent out of the country. Referring to the interjection of the honorable member for Herbert, my remarks in regard to the bounty being an infringement of State rights may have misled the Acting Prime Minister and the honorable member for South Sydney. I stated that considerable dissatisfaction exists throughout Australia in regard to Federation, and, in reply to an interjection, I said that some of the legislation of the Commonwealth Parliament has been subversive of the rights of the States. I was asked to give an instance in which the legislation of this Parliament had infringed upon the rights of the States, and, in reply, I mentioned several Acts, including the Sugar Bounties and Excise Acts, the passing of which, in the opinion of lawyers, and in my opinion, went beyond the rights given to us under the Constitution. I did not refer to the passing of the Sugar Bounties Act as a grievance of any person in Queensland. I merely mentioned the Act as a bald legal instance, in the view of constitutional authorities - the question has never been determined by the Courts - in which the Commonwealth Parliament, perhaps unwittingly, but certainly not without warning, overstepped the strict bounds of the Constitution. I am glad to have had the opportunity afforded to me by the speech of the honorable member for Kennedy to put myself right in this matter. It would be absurd to say that Queenslanders, or those connected with the sugar industry in Queensland, desire the abolition of the bounty. </para>

            <para>. - I was astounded at the statement attributed to the honorable member for Brisbane, especially in view of the circumstances in which it was supposed to have been made. I was not present when he made it, but I read a report of the debate. He seems to have been indulging in vague talk, which is unfortunately too common with some honorable members, about the dissatisfaction, or - to use his own word - exasperation prevalent amongst the public in regard to the conduct of Federal affairs. Honorable members thereupon asked him to give an instance in justification of the statement that such exasperation existed. He seemed rather taken aback by the request. </para>

That section lays it down that taxing measures shall deal only with taxation ; in other words, that the House shall not b&#39;e able to tack one measure to another - to an Appropriation Bill, for instance - in order to insure its passing, so as to avoid the suspension of the payment of salaries and other financial operations.

The honorable member should further know that the Bounties Act, as such, was passed after we had made, apparently, a. constitutional slip by allowing originally a rebate of the Excise. We altered the whole procedure so as to avoid the possibility of any constitutional objection being taken.

However much the honorable member may disagree with the legislation or with the policy of the measures passed by the Parliament, however much he may disagree with the majority for the time being - he should try to distinguish between attacking those measures and attacking the institution of Federation. </para>

              <para>- I am walling to make a little arrangement with the honorable member to prove what I say, if the honorable member wishes. Undoubtedly some of those who were for Federation are now against it ; but, mainly, that dissatisfaction exists amongst those of more conservative mind, who did not expect that Federation was going to turn out exactly as it has turned out. And because they have been beaten by the electors they are proportionately disgruntled at the present time. At the same time, I am satisfied that, if Australia were polled to-day, and even if New South Wales were polled today - and I speak from the result of the election the. other day, and from my experience of meetings, and so forth - we should find that the objection to Federation that is so loudly voiced, has not the solid body of voting power behind it that some honorable members think. It would be found, I feel sure, that the people, when appealed to, would stand by the institution of Federation - that they would respond to the appeal with enthusiasm. I notice in New South Wales, where the Premier&#39; the other day went out of his way to talk revolution and a lot of other silly nonsense, that his supporters are now busy pointing out- </para>

              <para>-Misrepresenting ! I do not think it is necessary to endeavour to misrepresent <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers</inline> on this point, because he has said so much that we may will leave him, very fitly, to stew in his own grease. But, notwithstanding the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers</inline> made so much of the anti-Federal aspect of the situation, and complained so much of the attitude of the Federal Parliament, the two leading newspapers of Sydney, which are behind <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers,</inline> and which fought valiantly on his behalf during the elections - and one of them lied with cheerfulness to assist his supporters - are now busily engaged in reproving him for having played such a bad card - for having taken up the anti-Federal side when he ought to have known, if he had any foresight at all, that it was a losing card to play. This, I say, is very significant. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member for &#39;Flinders having just arrived, a moment ago, to participate in the business of Parliament, seems inordinately anxious that none of us should reply to interjections or statements made before he came in. Perhaps, if the honorable member had been here a little earlier, he might have excused as pardonable a desire to reply to statements which have been made. I have been trying to point out that the remarks from the Opposition benches about the unpopularity of Federation, and of the Federal institution, are not altogether justified. </para>

The inconsistency of the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> is shown by the fact that it pointed out all kinds of objections to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers</inline> twelve months ago, whereas when the election approached, it discovered innumerable virtues in his attitude.

            <para>The common-sense of the country was fixed from the first against his tactics of setting State against Commonwealth, encouraging the idle cry of secession, and appealing to the unthinking against that indissoluble federal compact into which these States freely entered about seven years ago. There is little doubt now that in adopting this line of action the Premier weakened his own case, and arrayed the best minds of thoughtful federalists against him. It was a mistake to be regretted on many grounds, and now that the contest is over that aspect of the case has to be strongly emphasized. </para>

            <para>.- Many honorable members seem to think it absolutely necessary to speak in defence of the dignity and the rights of the Federal Parliament. We have the welfare of the Parliament in our own hands, and it appears to me that if we were to devote ourselves more thoroughly to the business submitted to us, we should so commend our work to the taxpayers of Australia that nothing that might be urged against us by the States Legislatures would be of any avail. I do not intend to occupy the attention of the Committee at great length; but my knowledge of constitutional government is sufficient to satisfy me that in voting for these various items we are practically surrendering to the Government our control over the expenditure to which they relate. We passed a Supply Bill for three months a short time ago, and we are now asked practically to grant further supplies amounting to  &#163;819,000.  Such a proposed expenditure is of infinitely more importance than is any question as to what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers</inline> or any one else may have done. We find, for instance, that provision is made in these Estimates for an expenditure of  &#163;250,000  on harbor and coastal defence, but we have no information as to how this money is to be expended. It is remarkable that, although we have a separate item relating to an expenditure of  &#163;15,  together with an explanation of how the money is to be expended, we have absolutely nothing to guide us in voting for this enormous expenditure on harbor and coastal defence. </para>

            <para>. - I  wish in the first place to refer to an item relating to a proposal to erect a post office at Curlewis, which is in my electorate.  I  cannot understand why the Department, since it has decided that such a building is necessary for the public convenience, should have placed upon the Estimates only half the amount necessary to provide for its construction. I wish to know why provision has not been made for the total cost. Not more than four or five months would be occupied in calling for tenders and carrying out the work, and yet the Government would have us believe that they are in earnest in proposing this work, when on these Estimates they provide only  &#163;400  in respect of it. The probabilities are that no progress will be made with the erection of this necessary building until the beginning of the next financial year. In other words, the work may not be commenced this year, and this vote may lapse. That is a deplorable method of financing the Department. I ask the Postmaster-General to reconsider the position, and in the interests of the district to see that the full amount necessary for the construction of this post-office is provided. </para>

              <para>- The Minister of Trade and Customs has set a bad example in his administration of the Postal Department. He is in the habit of attempting to divert honorable members from the thread of their remarks by making specious statements. But the fact remains that only &#163;400 has been provided upon the Estimates for the construction of the post-office in question. That is not sufficient. If the Department admits that the building ought to be erected, why should it not be proceeded with and completed during the current financial year? </para>

            <para>In August last year, the late Joseph Clarke, clerk in charge of the Inland Mail&#39; Branch, sent in notice that he would like to retire in accordance with the regulations, as he was sixty years of age, and had been in the Department forty years. He was entitled to retire on a pension of two-thirds of his salary and &#34;six months&#39; leave on full pay, as he has subscribed to the superannuation fund since its inception. He was not allowed to retire, and the Acting Deputy Postmaster-General told him that his services could not possibly be dispensed with during the consideration of the tenders for carrying the mails that were to be dealt with in September. He worked from 9 a.m. until 10 p.m., Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays. The statements that have been prepared will show that on the night of the 17th October he was found in an unconscious state in his room at his office. He was taken to the Sydney Hospital, where he died the next day from paralysis of the brain, undoubtedly brought about by overwork of the brain. His-medical adviser repeatedly told him to give up the great mental strain he was subjected to, and if he did not his brain would certainly give way. </para>

              <para>- I am well aware of that. What I say is that the late Mr. Clarke was refused leave of absence with a view to retirement. I hold in my hand the evidence of one who ought to know. I do not think that any private institution would have treated an officer of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Clarke&#39;stalent</inline> and application in the manner i&#187; which he was treated, by the Commonwealth authorities. Unfortunately there are other men in a position similar to that which he occupied, and it is because I wish to prevent them from being sacrificed on the altar of duty by the sweating which exists that I am taking this action. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Clarke</inline> had contributed to the New South Wales superannuation fund from its commencement,, and payment for some hundreds or thousands of hours of overtime was due&#34; to him.  His  widow asks for consideration in respect to his contributions to the superannuation fund, and in respect to the leave of absence which should have been granted to him to enable him to recover his health. She has been left with five children, and only one able to help her. Yet the Government has so little recognition of its duty in this matter that it has treated it as of no urgency. This is not the only case of hardship in the Post-office. Another case al* most as hard is that of  the  widow of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDonnell</inline> who served the Department for forty-five years, with credit to himself, and advantage to the public. He asked for leave of absence for six months prior to retirement, but was so worn out that at the end of three months he, too, joined the great majority. It was only an accident that he, like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Clarke,</inline> did not die at his post, a victim of the inhumane and inconsiderate administration which has prevailed so long. He, too, had contributed to the superannuation fund 4 per cent, of his salary, his contribution totalling &#163;231. The Department have had the use, of that money, but when the widow applied for some consideration she was told, in a cold-blooded way, that her husband, not having lived long enough to draw a pension, she was not entitled to anything. </para>

              <para>- I am not sure; I should like an explanation from the Minister on the subject. Subsequently when probate of the will was obtained, she applied to the Department for six days&#39; pay due to her husband at the time of his death, and they had the audacity to deduct from the amount owing 4 per cent, for the superannuation fund from which she was not to benefit. That action seemed to me to amount to systematic cruelty. </para>

              <para>- The point I wish to emphasize  is  that it is the Federal administration which  is  responsible for the sweating which drove these men into their graves. I hope that the Postmaster-General will not defer action until he has received lengthy reports from his officials in regard to the present unhealthy and undesirable condition of affairs. I am informed that, during the last twelve months, men in the Telephone Branch have worked as much as 700 hours overtime, and that there is every likelihood that this overwork, which is undermining their health and stamina, will continue. Therefore I ask the Minister to go to Sydney, to meet the men, to let them put their cases before him, to make a personal investigation, and, if he finds that officers are being sacrificed because of the existence of an absolutely undesirable and unjust system, to remedy their grievances, in serious cases at all events, without waiting for reports. The facts which I have set before the Committee are discreditable to those at the head of the Postal Department in Sydney, and to the Commonwealth administration. Another matter to which I wish to direct the attention of the Treasurer is the inability of the States to come to a common understanding in regard to burdens undertaken, by the authorities of one State for the benefit of the people of another. I have in mind a hospital situated in Queensland, close to the New South Wales border, which gives relief to a large number of New South Wales patients ; but no provision is made for the payment by New <inline font-style="italic">South</inline> Wales of a subsidy to that hospital. About one-third of its expenditure is incurred in connexion with the treatment of patients from New South Wales, but no contribution to its finances is made by the New South Wales Government. </para>

              <para>- What I desire is that the Treasurer shall bring the matter before the next Conference of Premiers. If the  authorities of the Queensland hospital were to refuse to admit New South Wales patients,&#39; many lives might be lost, and many persons would be in a direful plight. I wish to prevent such an unfortunate contingency as the hospital having to close its doors against New South Wales patients. Therefore, I hope that the Prime Minister will give effect to mv suggestion. I have not yet expressed mv opinions in regard to the Tariff, and I shall not do so at this stage, because it would not be in order, and opportunities will be presented in the future, when, perhaps, I shall say more than will prove comfortable to those who are opposing some of the protective items. </para>

            <para>. - I shall give the honorable member the information he requires. Early in 1905 the State Collector, Western Australia, reported that it was impossible to continue working in the Fremantle Customs House, owing to its dilapidated and insanitary condition, and the matter was brought under &#39; the notice of the Department of Home Affairs, with a view to early, action) being taken. In April of the same year, the honorable member for North Sydney, then Minister of Home Affairs, suggested that the present post-office  -  which is exactly opposite the Customs House - would, if renovated and improved, answer the purpose for a few years. The Collector reported against the suggestion, and pointed out that the transfer of the Customs staff to the present post-office would involve considerable time in making necessary alterations to the building. On the 8th of May, 1906, the question of the erection of the proposed new Customs House was brought up at a meeting of the Fremantle Chamber of Commerce, and it was contended that the State Government should offer to give a central site to the Federal Government, or sell such a site at cost price, to be used for the erection of the building. Fremantle is the chief port of the State, and will remain so, and the old post-office building was most unsuitable for the purposes of a Customs House. Land, 180 feet to Phillimore-street and no feet to Cliff-street, the site of the old railway station), has been secured, to be treated as a transferred property.  A building, containing the usual long room and public accommodation, in addition to the accessory rooms for the staff, will be erected. Caretaker&#39;s quarters will also be erected on the portion of the site not occupied by the main building. I may say that I visited the old building myself, and found it so dilapidated and insanitary that I would not undertake to go through it. When I was on my way to and from England I also visited the new site, and found it to be the best available. </para>

              <para>- The site is to be paid for as transferred property. The arrangement I made when I was Minister of Trade and Customs was that this land should be taken over at cost price, an3 treated as a transferred property. As to the new launch for Sydney, it is necessary, because the shipping work is increasing, and requires prompt and unremitting attention to avoid complaints of delay. The present small launch is not suitable for the work, being slow and not satisfactory ; but it will be utilized for emergency work. </para>

              <para>- No. As to the Customs House at Broken Hill, the present premises are leased from the municipality at a rental of &#163;175 per annum. It is considered to be more economical and convenient to erect a Commonwealth building, .and a site in a Postal Department reserve is under consideration. In reference to the laboratory, I have to say that, owing to the Commerce Act and an extension of the&#39; provisions of the Customs Act in regard to compound medicines, &#38;c, the analytical work has greatly increased, both in the Victorian branch . and, the Central staff. The work is at present done by the State Government Analyst ; but our requirements, are so large, and are increasing so rapidly, that the work is frequently congested. Many questions are referred to this office from other States, and as the goods are necessarily detained until a decision is given, it is requisite that this Department should be in a position to promptly act, and thus avoid the complaints now received from merchants. It is proposed to establish, the laboratory at the Victorian Customs House. This Department allows the State Government the sum of  .&#163;500  per annum for the work at present .performed, but this allowance will cease on the work being undertaken by the Customs. </para>

            <para>.- I should like some information in reference to the proposed expenditure on a trawler. Last year we voted  ,&#163;8, 000  for this purpose, and it was supposed that that would cover the whole cost ; but now the proposed expenditure has reached  &#163;12,000,  and there ought to be some explanation. It has been stated, I do not know with what truth, that the design of the trawler provided a large amount of cabin accommodation, but no room for fish. I have never seen a  reply to that statement. </para>

          <para class="block">I may say that when I was Minister of Trade and Customs I initiated the proposal to procure a trawler bv communicating with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nansen,</inline> Consul for Norway, in London, -who went to a great deal of trouble in sending out to us what were described as plans for the very best class of trawler that could be designed. Those plans arrived, if I remember rightly, just after the Prime Minister and I left for England. When in London I saw <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.. Nansen</inline> on several occasions, and he confirmed what had already been stated as to the value of the plans with which we had been supplier!, declaring that they were for the very best class of investigating trawler. This will be a scientific vessel. When the plans were examined, it was found by our officials that some alterations would have to be made. They were designed for a vessel to be used in a cold climate, where very little provision is made for ventilation and lighting, and in regard to those two requirements alterations were necessary. I saw in one of the newspapers a statement that the plans provided for fittings of an unnecessarily elaborate character. I took the trouble to inspect them, and found. that the cabin accommodation was only that which was1 necessary for the crew, for one or two scientific men who would be required to conduct investigations, and for a pilot, who would have to be taken on whenever the vessel was entering or leaving certain harbors. The statement that the accommodation was too elaborate was, I found, incorrect. &#34;When the plans were final I v dealt with by the officers, the estimated cost was increased, and that is why we provide on these Estimates for a vote of  ,&#163;12,000  instead of  &#163;8,000. </para>

              <para>- I do not know about that, but the Government could not accept a tender from a man who had not the necessary plant unless they had a satisfactory guarantee that the work would be carried out. I think that some of the calculations in regard to the cost of this trawler are absolutely wrong. One was made on the basis of Australian wages being 87 per cent, in advance of those which would be paid if the vessel were constructed in Great Britain. I do not know what is the foundation for such an estimate, but the position to-day is that further action . will be taken. Acting on a suggestion made to me, a letter is to be sent to-morrow to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers</inline> asking whether he will permit the plans to be examined by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cutler,</inline> who surpervises the works at the Fitzroy Dock. If we can obtain an estimate of a reliable character showing that a trawler of the class required can be constructed for a lower sum than that provided on these Estimates, this amount will not be spent. I do not think it wise to mention another alternative open to the Department. </para>

              <para>- I think it could. I believe that it would be fit for almost any class of work for which a vessel, of her size could be used. She will be a good sea-going boat, and we must remember that a trawler for service on the Australian coast must have good sea-going qualifications. We have rough seas, and since trawling has to be carried out very often at a considerable distance from land, it would not do to have a vessel that might be lost in a storm. The plans provide for a vessel on Norwegian lines, strongly recommended by a gentleman who is acknowledged to be one of the greatest experts in the world. </para>

              <para>- Judging by the plans, I should say there would be no doubt about that. I hope that honorable members will not ask me to go into details as to the alternative open to us. if we cannot construct this vessel in the way now proposed. We shall expend only the lowest sum for which we can secure such a vessel. I do not know that I have any further information at present with regard to this project. </para>

So far from my having failed to quote the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers</inline> at his next meeting, I wish to say that some hours ago in this chamber I quoted several sentences from his speech, which follow exactly the same lines as does the quotation which I have just made. But it did not suit the purpose of the honorable member for Parramatta to quote <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers&#39;</inline> words in connexion with the revolutionary attack which that gentleman indulged in.  His  words, however, are in print, despite all the efforts of the honorable member for Parramatta to twist them. </para>

They have received full consideration at the hands of the Opposition, and yet nothing whatever has been done. One reads in the newspapers occasionally that the Minister of Trade and Customs, and a number of officials have met together for the purpose of considering the plans of the proposed trawler. But now we hear from the Acting Prime Minister that nothing has been done. </para>

              <para>- But it appears that the tenders received are unsatisfactory. The Acting Prime Minister objects to an expenditure of &#163;10,000 or &#163;12,000 in securing an up-to-date vessel. If the fishing industry is going to be a great one - such as we believe it will be - an expenditure of a few extra thousand pounds ought not to be considered an obstacle in the way of securing a suitable vessel for trawling experiments. If we commence well, the probability is that the undertaking will prove a success. But the Acting Prime Minister apparently desires to shroud the matter in mystery. He now says that he has an  alternative scheme up his sleeve, the nature of which he will not disclose. </para>

              <para>- Then what is the cause of the delay? Apparently the Government are afraid to give the honest tenderer from Tasmania the contract, notwithstanding that we have nothing whatever at stake. The successful tenderer would have to lodge a deposit, and if he did not supply a vessel up to the standard of the specifications, the Government would be under no obligation to take it over. I say that we ought not to hang this matter up indefinitely. Do not let us nibble at it and allow the incompetent gentleman at the head of affairs to again confer with the State authorities~in regard to it. More than three months have elapsed since he conferred with the experts in Sydney. If the Government are in earnest upon this matter, they ought to get to work within a reasonable period. Otherwise let them Boldly declare that they do not wish to establish this industry. The position at the present time is most unsatisfactory. </para>

            <para>. - I trust that the Government, before accepting any tender for the construction of the trawler, will see that the working conditions -to be observed by the contractor are such as prevail in the best shops in Australia. I am given to understand that the lowest tender for the contract was that of a firm in Tasmania. I hope that the Government will insist that the men employed upon the construction of the vessel shall enjoy absolutely the same conditions as those which have to be observed by the most . reputable firms on the mainland. Speaking generally, trade unionism is far stronger upon the mainland than it is in Tasmania, and, as the bulk of the work in connexion with the construction of the trawler would be done by boiler-makers, ship-wrights, and engineers, the Government should be careful to see that the best conditions - so far as employes are concerned - are observed. </para>

              <para>- I do not mind that. It is a speech such as I have been accustomed to make all my life. An extra &#163;3,000 or &#163;4,000 is neither here not there in an important project of this kind. We discussed the question of developing the fish industry of Australia long before the proposition was submitted by the right honorable member for Swan in his last Budget speech. It is quite eighteen months since we debated this project, and since it was heartily approved of by all sections of the Committee. Yet we find that nothing whatever has been done. It does not say much for the efficiency or vigour of our administration. If we cannot within eighteen months obtain tenders for a trawler to cost only &#163;8,000; what shall we do when we begin to build our Australian Navy? I am afraid that it will be a long time  before Australia has a fleet built by her own people, if dilatoriness like this is to continue to characterize our administration. Surely there are engineering establishments in Australia which could turn out a trawler, and, in fact, several trawlers, within a year. The fault must be with the Government, and the sooner more vigour and business enterprise is infused into the management of some of our Departments the better it will lie for the Commonwealth. I should like to see the trawler built and put to work, because I think that it will open up a large fish supply, and a good supply of fish is one of the nation&#39;s most urgent requirements. I do not know why the Minister has dealt so gingerly with this subject. </para>

            <para>. - I should like to know why .&#163;1,000 is set down for a laboratory in Victoria, and, like the honorable member for Parramatta, I wish for more information in regard to the proposed trawler. If we cannot get a trawler built in Australia within eighteen months, God help us when we have to construct our own torpedo boats and torpedo destroyers. Apparently, it has taken eighteen months to find out that the plans and. specifications were wrong, and that the tenders were too high. </para>

              <para>- Surely a Treasurer like the right honorable member for Swan would not have objected to advance .a few thousands. There was no opposition to the construction of a trawler when it was first proposed to test our fish supplies ; but now, after a lapse of eighteen months, we are told that the money voted was not sufficient. On what was the original estimate based? Surely sums are not set down haphazard. </para>

Under that arrangement there have been delays. We ask for &#163;1,000 to equip a laboratory of our own which will enable the work to be done by Commonwealth officials. These analyses are very important, especially when evidence is required ku connexion with law suits.

              <para>- Certainly we do. The vessel will be 155 feet in length, 23 feet in beam, and 11 feet  9-  inches in depth. The original plans were obtained through the Norwegian Consul in London, who was at pains to get us the most approved design from Norway; but as it was evident that the ventilation provided was not sufficient for this climate, the design; had to be altered. This took some little time, and then three or four months were allowed for the inspection of the plans. Three or four tenders were received, at prices ranging from .&#163;10,000 to- &#163;20,000 ; but it now turns out that the lowest tenderer cannot proceed. As . he has not the necessary plant, we gave him time- in which to obtain guarantees for the proper carrying out of the work, but ultimately he withdrew from the undertaking. That tender came from the Mersey. I have since asked the Premier of New South Wales if Ave mav submit the plans to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cutler.</inline></para>

I do not see why, for the sake of building our first trawler in Australia, we should pay &#163;4,000 or &#163;5,000 more for it than would suffice to buy as good or a better boat. The Government ought to obtain some information as to the price at which a suitable boat could be obtained abroad, and if the price of such a vessel be somewhere about &#163;8,000, we ought, in my opinion, to reduce the item to that amount. </para>

              <para>- Municipal bodies are complaining that that Tariff has increased the cost of building materials, and it is a reasonable assumption that the addition of &#163;4,000 is due to the fact that the Government know the trawler cannot be built for the same sum now as before the Tariff was introduced. It seems to me that the Government have realized that the Tariff will increase prices, and that provision must be made accordingly. </para>

            <para>.- The Minister in charge of these Estimates is an ardent protectionist, and is, therefore, desirous of having the proposed trawler built in Australia. But the lack of enterprise of many of the engineering firms in Australia is such that for eighteen months it has been found impossible to obtain a satisfactory tender for a vessel of such small dimensions as a trawler. I had hoped that Mort&#39;s Dock and Engineering Company might have undertaken the work, but they did not get the order. .There are, however, other engineering firms in Port Jackson which might have been thought to have sufficient enterprise to meet the Government in this matter. The sum originally placed on the Estimates for this purpose was  ,&#163;8,  000, and we now find that increased by almost 100 per cent. I ask honorable members, whether freetraders or protectionists,&#39; to seriously consider this question. Our engineering firms lack something &#39; if they cannot build a vessel of this character. Day after day we find certain newspapers in Australia urging that we should build an Australian Navy, but the rank absurdity of the suggestion is shown in face of the fact that up to the present we have been unable to produce- a trawler. These are unpleasant facts, but we have to face them. I understand that three tenders were sent in, but that, although questions were asked in regard to them, no satisfactory information could be obtained. I have been told on good authority, however, that the lowest tender came from Tasmania, and that the firm which tendered did not get the contract because they were unable to provide the stipulated guarantee. </para>

              <para>- The trawler must be an iron vessel, but the ship- wright of to-day works both in iron and wood. It does not follow that, because a man has hitherto built only wooden vessels, he would not be able to build a vessel of iron. Since the question of protection has been introduced, I may say that I am going to kick over the traces pretty freely in matters affecting my own electorate. I have been a consistent free-trader for years, but  1  have come to&#39; the determination just indicated, on seeing other honorable members, who call themselves free-traders, &#34;scooping the pool&#34; for their own electorates. We were told by the press that this trawler was to be a magnificently appointed vessel; in other words, that it was to be a yacht for the Treasurer. I read that the Treasurer was very much annoyed at the press descriptions of the vessel - at the suggestion that it was to be used, not only for trawling, but for Cabinet meetings and other fancy political work during trips round the Sydney harbor, for example. It was,  I  think, the great protectionist organ, the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> that mentioned these particulars, and as this paper has taken me up, I am, of course, a made man.  I think  the Treasurer ought to have an opportunity to-night to repudiate the&#62; insinuations which have been made regarding the vessel. I do not believe that the Treasurer would use public money, ostensibly for a trawler, but really for insidious political purposes. I know that the Treasurer, two days after the description appeared, &#39; said that he had looked at the specifications, and that, outside the space required for scientific purposes, there was not room to &#34; swing a cat.&#34;  1\Tow  if the increase from  &#163;8,000  to ,&#163;12,000 means a vessel of over-elaborate equipment, then the estimate ought to be reduced. I  am   desirous of seeing the vessel built in Australia, but if it be proposed to go to extremes and pay &#163;12,000, when an &#163;8,000 vessel would suffice, I shall oppose the item. The trawler is intended only to voyage along the coast and test the fishing grounds ; and the Treasurer knows that the best vessel for the purpose is not one of the character described by the newspapers, but one of the tug-boat type, possessing good horse-power. It should be manned by those who are accustomed to rough it in all sorts of weather, and should not be fitted lip for yachtsmen taken from Port Phillip or Port Jackson. I fail to see why such a vessel should cost &#163;12,000. There axe some scientists who would like her to be fitted up in a fanciful way. </para>

              <para>- He did. It had always been the custom for the Premier of New South Wales to do what he did in this respect, and I do not think that New South Wales has lost by practising such courtesies. I do not say, however, that we should go from one extreme to the other. If the Treasurer has in mind the building of a vessel for pleasure purposes, let him come out into the open and say so. Do not let us spoil a trawler to mate a bad pleasure-boat. I hope this vessel will be built for practical purposes, and not for Saturday afternoon pleasure excursions. How is it that engineering firms on the mainland were not able to tender successfully for such a vessel? </para>

              <para>- That seems ridiculous. Larger vessels than that now under consideration have been successfully built in Sydney. I would remind the Committee that I have had a certain notice of motion oh the business-paper, and that so far as the fiscal question is concerned, I have slipped, not only on iron, but on shipbuilding. If the Government would grant a bounty to encourage ship-building, there would be no difficulty in securing the local construction of vessels of this character. No doubt some firms are standing out for a good profit ; but I am glad, to hear from the Acting Prime Minister that the intention is to build a good serviceable trawler, and not &#34; a razzle-dazzle &#39; &#39; steamer designed to catch, not fish, But votes. The Minister should give a public denial to the statements that have been made, that this is to be a pleasure yacht, and he should also give the names of those who have sent in tenders, the amounts at which they tendered to do the work, and the reason why an increased vote is sought. </para>

              <para>- Her fittings will be comfortable, but not elaborate. On examining the plans I was struck by the extent of the provision made for coal carrying, as -well as for fish wells. It is necessary that such a vessel should have a considerable coal carry ing&#34;&#39; capacity, for she may often proceed some distance from a port at which she could coal, and she will  have to carry with her a supply sufficient to enable her to steam from point to point. So far as the officers and crew of the vessel are concerned, too much consideration for their comfort has not been shown. </para>

            <para>.- Th The first item in this division relates to additions to fortifications for which, under the heading of &#34;new services,&#34; a sum of ,&#163;273 is provided. There is also a re-vote of .-&#163;44. There is a further item of &#163;1.00 for new works fortifications, and I should like some information with regard to all these matters, as well as in respect to the Sydney . forts. Has anything been done since the Prime Minister some twelve months ago made a very alarming statement with regard to their condition? It was said, not only by him, but bv an eminent military authority here, that the fortifications and the guns of Sydney Harbor were in a very  unsatisfactory condition - that the guns  were of an obsolete type, and that the fortifications were out of date. When the Estimates were before us last year, I referred to the small provision made for fortifications for New South Wales, as compared with the amounts set apart for the same purpose in Western Australia. The amount expended last year in Western Australia alone was far in excess of the total amount provided under the same heading for all the other States. I find on looking through these Estimates that a similar state of affairs prevails. &#34;Under this heading there is a total of &#163;5,923 for additions to fortifications, and towards the cost of construction of fort and acquisition of site at North Fremantle and Arthur&#39;s Head in Western Australia. </para>

              <para>- It is necessary to discuss this particular matter because of its bearing upon the whole subject of Fortifications. I wish to know whether any report has been obtained as to the present condition of the fortifications in Port Jackson. Are the guns there of an obsolete pattern? Are the fortifications old-fashioned? If so, why has not a sum been placed upon the Estimates to enable them to be brought up to date? The amount set down for improving fortifications in a little State like Western Australia </para>

              <para>- It is not to be compared with the ports of Sydney and Melbourne. The approach to Fremantle would be a dangerous one for large warships, and the port could not be shelled from the sea, because of the high land of Rottnest Island intervening. The total- expenditure proposed in New South Wales under the heading of &#34; Fortifications &#34; is&#163;317, that for Victoriais&#163;572,ofwhich , &#163;375 is to be expended upon additional works, and &#163;197 upon new works. In Queensland, the expenditure under this heading is &#163;330, of which . &#163;200 is a revote. </para>

            <para>. - The &#163;5,750, which it is proposed to expend upon the fortifications of Fremantle, represents portion of a revote of &#163;8 , 060 last year. If the honorable member for&#34; Lang will look at page 281 of the Estimates he will find there an item which reads &#34; Guns, lights, and emplacements for fixed defences&#34;, &#163;50,000&#34; That &#163;50,000 will be expended in accordance with the  recommendations of the Imperial Defence Committee. The total sum to be expended in that connexion is ,&#163;280,000. As. however, the Government did not feel justified in asking Parliament to vote that amount during one year, it will be distributed over probably four years. </para>

              <para>- Yes. Fremantle is exactly in the same category as the other States so far as guns, lights, and emplacements for fixed defences are concerned. This item appears separately in the Estimates because it was under consideration prior to the receipt of the recommendations of the Imperial Defence Committee. That Committee approved of the erection of fortifications at Fremantle, and also of alterations being effected in the fortifications of Newcastle, Sydney, Melbourne, and other ports. </para>

So far as Sydney, Melbourne, Hobart, Newcastle, and other ports which may be in the minds of honorable members are concerned, the recommendations of the Imperial Defence Committee will, generally speaking, be -carried out; but lights which are found to be defective will be dealt with first of all.

            <para>. - To my mind, the honorable member has not furnished an adequate explanation of the items to which attention has been drawn b&#34; the honorable member for Lang, merely throwing dust in his eyes. That, of course, is his affair. But the Committee cannot- be expected to vote &#163;23,000 odd without requiring explanation in regard to the various items. I should like to know why separate proposals for expenditure are made in regard to rifle ranges. For instance, item 3 provides .&#163;4,972 for rifle ranges without specifying where the money is to be expended; then &#163;^317 is set down for the Adamstown rifle range; &#163;330 for the extension of the Cootamundra rifle range; and &#163;394 for the extension of the Lismore rifle range. There is another amount of &#163;853 for rifle ranges generally, in regard to which no details  are  supplied ; &#163;1,000 for a rifle range at Long Bay ; &#163;1,350 for a rifle range at Singleton; ,&#163;27 for a rifle range at Telegraph Point : and .&#163;750 for miniature rifle ranges for cadets - a very proper expenditure this. I should like to know how this money &#34;is to be distributed. Finally, there is ,&#163;1,000 for grants to rifle clubs for ranges. </para>

            <para>. - Is any provision made for the supply of telephones on rifle ranges? Many clubs suffer great inconvenience owing to the fact that when a shot is challenged some one has to make a trip of 800 or 900 yards in order to settle the matter, and there is a fine of 2s. 6d. on the challenger if the challenge should prove to have been unnecessary. A cheap system of telephone communication would save, not only a good deal of running about, but considerable expense. The Orange range is a case in point. </para>

It appears to me that &#163;1,000 is a large sum to vote for merely dredging out a boat harbor. Has this reference tlo the dredging of that portion of the Bay where the torpedo boats are moored? I paid a visit last Saturday morning to Swan Island, when it was pointed out to me that the place where the <inline font-style="italic">Childers</inline> ought to moor was so shallow that she could not take a berth.

I am not an expert, but it appears to me that this work is unnecessary. However, if it be necessary, I hope the Department will bear the expense, and not call upon the clubs to bear the burden. The range at Ipswich has been in existence for about twenty years, and there has never been any accident, or any complaint as to its safety. I see also that there is &#163;1,000 provided towards the cost of the construction and site of the Brisbane rifle range, and on reference to a foot-note, I find that the total&#39; cost is to be &#163;5,000.

            <para>. - I wish to draw the attention of tha Minister of Defence to the fact that although nearly every little hamlet in Australia has a rifle range either already in existence or provided for in these Estimates, Parramatta is still without one. I take not the slightest exception to any of these items, but I wonder what a place like Parramatta has done that it seems impossible for it to secure a range. It has a population of from 10,000 to 12,000 and is the centre of a large district, in which there are several corps. The Minister is pursuing a policy in regard to rifle ranges generally for which I have the greatest admiration, but I cannot induce him to consent to buy a site for a range at Parramatta. I do not hesitate to say that it is neither more nor less than a scandal that this state of affairs should continue, and that troops and. riflemen should have to go eight miles to practice. The land there may be a little costly, but I have yet to learn that an expenditure of a few pounds should stand in the way of proper provision being made for the riflemen of such a large and growing district. I wish the Minister to explain why action has not been taken, and to say whether he will take into consideration the advisableness of purchasing a site, even although the land mav be somewhat costly. There are corps of infantry and troops of Australian Light Horse in the district. </para>

            <para>. - I agree with the honorable member that there ought to be a rifle range at Parramatta, and I have given a considerable amount of time to an investigation of the facts. The difficulty of securing suitable sites for riflemen in populous centres is becoming more and more pronounced, as the range of our rifles is being increased. A. modern title has a range, not of a few hundred yards, but of a mile or two, and as the country becomes more settled the difficulty of securing suitable ranges in many places is greatly increased. Within the last week or two I caused to be sent to the Commandant of New South Wales a special request that responsible persons in Parramatta should be interviewed with a view of ascertaining whether or not a suitable site could be obtained. I have a note of the matter, and am endeavouring to  remedy  the grievance, because I think it is right that it should be remedied. &#39; For the last ten or fifteen years, a site near  Melbourne  has been used as a rifle range, but the time is fast approaching when we shall not be able to devote it to that purpose. </para>

            <para>. - Meantime it occurs to me that where riflemen are subjected to these disabilities, the least the Department can do is to come to their relief by enabling them to travel free of cost to distant ranges. Not only does the Minister refuse to provide riflemen at Parramatta with a local range, but when they travel seven or eight miles to obtain practice they have to pay their own fares. </para>

These men are suffering disabilities, and I wish to see them provided with a range nearer home. If the Minister will see that they are meantime under no financial disability in obtaining practice, I shall be satisfied.

              <para>- I am speaking of the general principle. As I understand the honorable member&#39;s point, it is this : In town A, or adjacent to it, there is a rifle range; but in town B riflemen have to travel a certain distance in order to obtain practice. The honorable member wishes to know whether the Department will discriminate in the direction of providing travelling facilities for those who at town&#39; B have no local range on which to practice. I think that the proposal is a reasonable one, and will do the best I can in the circumstances. </para>

            <para>.- There is another matter to which I think the Minister should give consideration. Although he says that the Treasurer and the Defence Department are fairly generous in dealing with the rifle clubs, I hold that he ought to see that the treatment of the rifle movement generally is sufficiently generous. There is not1 the least doubt that rifle ranges must be established close to our towns, and the longer we delay the complete settlement of this question the greater will be the cost of securing suitable sites. The rifleman has become an absolutely necessary part of the defence system. Quite recently the Minister informed the honorable member for Bendigo that he was unable to increase the corps there, because there was no provision in the Estimates for an increase. There is no doubt that many who would like to join the militia and volunteer forces have not an opportunity to do so, and consequently they have to confine their energies to rifle shooting. And yet we find that in many cases they are handicapped by a total, absence of reasonable accommodation for rifle practice. I take it that the honorable member for Parramatta desires that a rifle range shall be provided for every town that can show that it is entitled to it. But there is a much more serious question to be faced, and the delay on the part of the English authorities in dealing with it has cost the British Government thousands of pounds. I refer to the reservation of permanent sites for the training of troops generally. </para>

Knowing that the troops in this State had been exercised on portion of the land proposed to be resumed, I brought the matter under the notice of the then Minister of Defence, who called for a report. That wise and military-learned gentleman, Brigadier-General Gordon, reported that there was not the slightest objection to the proposal, as the land was not required. What was the outcome of this? </para>

          <para class="block">Last Easter a public-spirited citizen, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Rupert</inline> Clarke, had to be asked to place at the disposal of the Department completely new ground for the Easter manoeuvres. This was necessary because certain land had been excised from the Langwarrin reserve, and, on the report of the then State Commandant, not only had no protest been raised, but it had actually been approved by the Department. A man would heretofore have been dismissed for that sort of thing had there been in authority some one who knew how to sheet home the responsibility for error. After the Government had spent thousands of pounds in excavating dams to provide a permanent water supply at Langwarrin, and had also cleared and fenced in the reserve, certain land was resumed, and the reserve was rendered useless as a training ground. This was due to the fact that a stupid State Commandant ventured to furnish to the Department the report to which I have referred. I think I can appeal to the Minister of Defence to support my statement, although he was not in office at the time to which I refer. I ask him is it not a fact that Brigadier-General Gordon reported that the land proposed to be resumed at Langwarrin was not required for defence purposes, and that the Langwarrin reserve was found unsuitable for the Easter manoeuvres? Two new sites have been submitted. I brought under the notice of the Minister a Vast State forest near Bacchus Marsh, and mentioned the names of certain local residents who knew all about the land. Two officers were sent to the district to report. They spent only a short time there, and local men who knew that there were thousands of acres of Crown lands in the neighbourhood were not even approached. A most suitable site for a national training ground, within easy distance by rail of Melbourne, Castlemaine, Bendigo, and Ballarat, was thus passed over. What is now suggested in this connexion? The selection of Point Nepean - a narrow peninsula which can only be reached by sea - has been recommended, because an official at headquarters </para>

              <para>- It was the spot at which an attempt was made to establish the first convict settlement in Victoria. That attempt had to be abandoned because it was found that the locality was totally unsuited for the purpose, and, accordingly, in 1804, the convicts were removed to Tasmania. It is waterless, almost treeless, and hardly accessible. I wish to impress upon the Minister the absolute necessity for securing a report upon this matter from a military authority other than the State Commandant of Victoria. Let us obtain the opinion of a military authority from South Australia or Queensland - at least, from some competent person. </para>

As an encampment ground for militia or citizen troops, and for actual field work, the Bacchus Marsh site is well worth inspection. </para>

              <para>- I know that in all civilized countries the authorities are reserving or endeavouring to obtain as national training grounds for the troops, areas which measure not 15 miles by 10 miles, but much greater areas. The ground reserved for the purpose in Canada is a very large one, and the same remark is applicable to other countries. The training grounds which we acquire must be accessible, and must not cost too much, and it is these factors which make the problem of selection a difficult one. In each of the States we are endeavouring to obtain an area sufficiently large to meet all requirements, and one which for all time will be suitable for the purpose to which it is to be devoted.

That point is simply a narrow neck of land which is not more than one and a half miles wide at any part. The nearest railway station - Mornington - is quite thirty-five miles distant. I trust that the Minister will look carefully into this matter. Point Nepean is the most unsuitable site for the purpose which can be found in Victoria. </para>

              <para>- Where we can put 5,000 men in the field, the Japanese can put 50,000. The Minister has said that he requires a tract of country fifteen miles square to permit of the troops of one State being manoeuvred, notwithstanding that not a quarter of that area is required to manoeuvre the whole British Army. In England, the field guns in and around the military depot practise at Shoeburyness, and in the northern counties they practise on the Mersey. God knows we have plenty of sea room in Australia to enable artillery firing to be carried on. We do not need to provide for land ranges. From the western parts of England the troops, are taken to Dartmoor, where they can fire over miles of wasteland; but the field guns and fort guns are tried at Shoeburyness. At Woolwich, the head-quarters of the artillery, where manoeuvring is going on all the year round, I do not think that there is a reserve of more than 2,000 acres. Why, then, should such a large area be needed in Victoria? The Minister&#39;s officers are hoodwinking him. We have the authority of the honorable members for Corio and Yarra for the statement that they have recommended the reservation of a narrow neck of land not easily approachable by land or sea, and without railway communication, a preposterous site. Any one could be trusted to choose a better site than that. Yet it has the recommendation of an officer high in the Commonwealth service. The Committee should take this matter in hand; otherwise the  military authorities will only draw their salaries, and do nothing. </para>

            <para>. - I  am very loth to differ from the honorable member for Maranoa, who possesses a good deal of knowledge in regard to military matters; but I have watched the field artillery at practice in the National Park, near Sydney, during the last two Easter encampments, and by what I have learned in doing so, as well as by what I knew previously, I am convinced that large areas of country should be reserved for artillery ranges. It should not be difficult or expensive to get suitable areas for the purpose. As an honorable member has suggested to me, suitable land should be obtainable in Australia at no great expense. In every State within reasonable distances of the chief centres of population, there,  are  large areas of almost useless land, which it would not cost much to resume . and set apart for artillery practice. It is true enough, as the honorable member for Maranoa has said, that in England manoeuvres are conducted on comparatively small areas, and that artillery practice takes place on the sea-shore, the guns being fired out to sea. But the field artillery practice proper is conducted&#39; on a special range, to which battery after battery of the Royal Horse Artillery and the Field Artillery is sent for a certain period each year, to practice shell firing. </para>

              <para>- That is only another way of getting land practice. It is necessary, in order to judge of the effect of shell fire, to know where the shells fall, or where the shrapnel is projected, and for this land ranges are required. Furthermore, a large area is necessary for practising firing with live shell. The&#39; ground set apart should be sufficiently extensive to provide a variety of ranges, so that the gunners will have to exercise their judgment in sighting guns and setting fuses. It ought to be possible to provide approximately new ranges from time to time, to give the officers practice in determining distances, and to get as nearly as possible service conditions. In my opinion, an area measuring at least ten miles by five is necessary to do what is needed in this respect, and to enable provision to be made for disappearing and moving targets. In New South Wales the artillery now have the permission of the National Park trustees to use part of the park; but its use is restricted by the fact that the public go there too. Apparently there is at present no other land close to Sydney available for the purpose. Artillerymen are specialists who require a good deal of training, and it ought to be possible to obtain waste land near Sydney, and other large cities, on which they could be afforded opportunities for adequate practice. Possibly at some season of the year, such land could be used for depasturing stock, which would provide a return to set against the outlay. </para>

              <para>- Unfortunately, there is a good deal of poor land within a few miles of Sydney, and some of it could be reserved for artillery practice. The longer  reservation is delayed, the more expensive it will become, because settlement is constantly increasing, and values are rising. I think that there is Crown land which could be obtained without much cost, and I strongly urge that a reservation should be secured. In New South Wales for the last two or three years the Defence Department has had to rely on the goodwill of private land-owners to obtain ground on which to manoeuvre the infantry troops, and when the last Easter&#34; encampment was about to be held, several owners refused permission to the authorities to take the troops over their land, fearing, perhaps, that their fences might be injured, or other damage done. The Commonwealth has spent a lot of money in drilling the troops, but the annual manoeuvres which are indispensable for the training of officers in the management of men were almost blocked by the difficulty in obtaining the necessary ground. This difficulty is likely to increase as the country becomes more closely settled, and more largely cultivated. </para>

              <para>- I am charitable in assuming that ignorance prompted the interjection, because it would be wilful misrepresentation for any one who understood .bur proposals to say that a progressive land tax means nationalization. However, I shall not deal with that subject now. In my view, it would be wise for the Defence Department, with the. authority of Parliament, at the earliest possible moment to set about acquiring waste land for the training of troops. Such land may be acquired to-day comparatively cheaply, but in a few years it will be very expensive to buy. </para>

            <para>.- Tasmania may be a small place, but these items have evoked considerable discussion. I quite agree with the honorable member for South Sydney as to the necessity to secure large blocks of ground for the purpose of rifle ranges ; and I am supported in my view by the experience at Sandy Bay. There the small piece of ground used as a rifle range became dangerous as the population grew, and some other site had to be purchased at a large sum. Then, for the purpose of manoeuvres, large spaces are necessary, and, in my opinion, it would be well if the volunteers devoted some attention to shooting in the country, instead of confining their attention to rifle ranges. On the rifle range a man knows the exact distance, and, arranging his sights to a nicety, can score bull&#39;s eyes. But in the bush, or in the country, where he might have to meet an enemy, such as our troops met in South Africa, he would be confused as to the distances ; and some shooting practice in this connexion would be of great benefit. I know that as a youth I found grea*t advantage from firing at trees, and then ascertaining how far I was out in my judgment. So far as I can see, the Estimates in reference to Tasmania are satisfactory, and I believe that the money will be well spent. </para>

            <para>. - The Department has recently come to a decision which has had the effect of creating great disabilities as between the citizens of the Commonwealth in regard to telephone charges. A guiding principle in the administration should be to guard, as far as possible, against differentiating between citizens in regard to the privileges which they enjoy. And yet in populous centres like Melbourne and suburbs, and Sydney and suburbs, &#39; we find people living side by side, one paying &#163;j or <inline font-style="italic">&#163;8</inline> for a private telephone, and another enjoying the same advantages for &#163;5. In other words, this decision of the Department has had the effect of an all-round increase in the amount paid for private telephones. It is only a matter of time when the users of telephones shall have changed their residence, for this all-round increase of a very serious character to take place without any formal announcement. This is neither a straightforward nor a wise policy in a branch of the service so prosperous as is the telephone branch. Whatever may be placed to the credit of the previous Postmaster-General, I venture to say that this new regulation will stand to his discredit and that of whoever sanctioned or carried it into effect. It is a wrong policy, which ought to be abandoned at the earliest possible moment. </para>

              <para>- Why should the large centres not have the same facilities as the small centres? I am not complaining of small centres having facilities, but of large centres being cut off from facilities. In the suburbs of Melbourne, which are crowded centres of population, the subscribers who have no exchange must be connected, it may be, with an exchange in a small centre of population two or three miles away, where there happens to be an exchange, and have to pay &#163;2 or &#163;3 a year more than they have been accustomed to pay. The difficulty was previously got over by measuring the distance from the local post office to the residence of the subscriber. But that plan has been abolished, with the effects I have indicated. The new system affects my electorate as harshly, if not more harshly, than it affects any other electorate throughout the Commonwealth. The conservative policy which has marked the administration of the Postal Department recently is driving us back to a condition of things from which we have slowly and steadily emerged during the last fourteen or fifteen years. There ought to be a Minister strong enough to reverse a policy which has been inaugurated by the permanent officials in Melbourne. We are gradually drifting under the bureaucratic control of the officials, all through our not having Ministers strong enough to arrive at independent conclusions&#39;. There is creeping into important Departments top much of government by Under-Secretaries. We find the Defence Department and the Post and Telegraph Department paralyzed by reason of the conservatism of the officials ; and the sooner this is ended the better ; the sooner we have control by responsible Ministers, the more likely we are to .have good, government. I understand that the present Postmaster-General some time ago promised to investigate this telephone matter again; and I shall be glad to hear whether anything has been done towards righting the wrongs to which I have pointed in populous centres where the telephone system pays handsomely. </para>

What has been done, is <inline font-style="italic">lo</inline> fix a few arbitrary centres, and make everybody communicate through those centres, instead of providing exchanges where the population is. I contend that exchanges ought to be inaugurated in busy centres of population. Would the honorable member for Laanecoorie say that it is right or constitutional that a man should pay only &#163;5 for his telephone while his neighbour pays &#163;8 ? </para>

            <para>. - The honorable member for Parramatta and myself had this matter out on the floor of the House some two months ago.  His  answer, to me on that occasion was that I was &#34; bluffing again.&#34; The position is that certain imaginary centres were created, some of them by the honorable member. &#39; The system was to imagine that there was an exchange where none existed, and to charge from that place instead of charging from the place where the wire actually stretched from. </para>

              <para>- That is what the honorable member for Parramatta wants to do. The honorable member contended, .that two persons with the one service, living next door to each other, are being charged two different rates. When asked  by  the honorable member for Laanecoorie how that came about, he said that it was in consequence of one man changing his residence. If the honorable member knew what he was talking about, he would know that under the present system no more persons can come in under the old flat rate, and that if a man moves even next door She must come in under the toll rate. There is a very great, difference in the. services given under the toll and flat rates. Honorable members will remember the storm that was raised in this House and . in the country when we attempted to bring subscribers under the toll rate, which is the only business system possible, making them pay for the services they were getting. A number of these persons are still on the flat rate, and are getting a very much greater service than they pay for - in many instances a service which it costs us more to give than they pay. It is only a question of a little time when everybody will be put on the one footing, and the toll system established all round. The honorable member for Laanecoorie struck the nail on the head when he asked what the effect of the imaginary centres would be. The honorable member for Parramatta says, &#34; Charge from the nearest post office. &#39; &#39; If a man lived within half-a-mile of a post office the honorable member would charge him for that distance only, even if the Department had to put in seven miles of wire from the nearest exchange. He would charge him the same rate as the man who had only to get half-a-mile of wire. </para>

              <para>- That is the honorable member&#39;s whole argument. The object of the present system is to insure that a man shall pay for the service he receives. If that is followed out to its logical conclusion everybody will be placed on the one footing, and the whole system will be made a toll system, to which the honorable member for Parramatta objects. The man who gets half-a-mile of wire will pay for half-a-mile, and the man who gets five miles will pay for five miles. It will then be possible to make those gentlemen, who now cost us <inline font-style="italic">&#163;20, &#163;30,</inline> and ^40 a year for services for which they only pay <inline font-style="italic">&#163;9</inline> a year, pay for the cost of the service we give them, even without charging any profit. That will enable a man who only wants to use his telephone two or three times a day in the small villages, which the honorable member for Parramatta sneers at, to get his telephone for is. a week, because it does not cost the Department any more. </para>

              <para>- There is no incorrect statement about what I am now saying. What is the difference between a small exchange and a large one? It is the difference in the service. In the Sydney .or Melbourne Exchange a subscriber can ring up thousands of others,  whereas  in a &#39;country exchange the  number is limited to twenty or thirty. If a difference is made it ought to be in favour of the man who has the small service. With regard to what I call imaginary centres, the honorable member&#39;s own words were &#34; Charge from the nearest post office.&#34; He points to a case in his own district.

              <para>- It is. not possible to put exchanges everywhere except at very great expense. My contention was that until we could give men in the country districts and those living away from centres of civilization some telephone connexion, we should have to go a little slower in the big centres, and let them put up with what they have already. How are we to maintain a telephone service if we have to put in five miles of wire for a man and give him a service on the basis of half a mile, when the interest on the cost of the wire and the cost of maintenance come to more than he will be charged with - that is, according to the honorable member&#39;s theory of &#34;Charge from the nearest post office &#34;? To suppose centres of that kind will not pay. If we adopted that practice the Department would have to bear the loss and the man who gets the smaller service would have to make up for the man who is getting something that he is not paying for. </para>

              <para>- I was advised by my officers that we could afford to give that number. This is a service that we do not want to make money out of, but it must be made to pay. The reason why we are not getting all the subscribers under the toll system is very evident. The howl that went through the country, encouraged by many honorable members on the other side, when we brought some subscribers under the toll rate, will be remembered. Deputations waited on the present Minister of Defence, who was then acting for me in that capacity, and the newspapers said that we dared not introduce the toll system. But where are the advocates of the flat rate system to-day? They keep very quiet because they know that the toll system is the proper one, and has come to stay. Its introduction has created such a demand for telephones that it is difficult to keep up with the demand, but when we are able to cope with the demand, and can give a reasonable service, then will be the time to put every man on the same footing, making him&#39; pay for what he gets and having no imaginary centres. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member becomes angry about this question, because as he plaintively says &#34; It affects my district.&#34; If the honorable member&#39;s scheme of imaginary centres is adopted, there will be nothing to prevent a man, who lives 15 miles from Melbourne and only one from the nearest post office, from having 15 miles of wire put in and being charged as though he were within 1 mile of the exchange. It would be very nice for the man, but with such a system how could we give people in the country districts telephones? When I spoke of imaginary centres I said as a chance shot that probably the honorable member for Parramatta introduced them in New South Wales. I produced the evidence next day, and the honorable member promptly moved the adjournment of the House, stormed, and talked about &#34; bluffing.&#34; The policy of the Department at that time - I leave it to my colleague to deal with what obtains at present - was to put men in such a position that they would get a service at the least possible cost, but that each should pay according to the service he received. </para>

              <para>- Anywhere in Australia. Now, however, the Department desire to alter that arrangement by saying that because it does not suit them to establish fresh exchanges in certain places they will establish a  3-mile  limit. The consequence is that a subscriber who is more than one mile, and less than three miles, from a telephone exchange has to pay extra mileage, although there may be  500  persons in his vicinity who are subscribers to the telephone system, and who wish to have a local exchange. The point is that this extra mileage is charged, not because it is necessary, but because it suits the convenience of the Department not to establish new local exchanges. </para>

              <para>- It is simply because it suits the Department to carry the telephone lines to central exchanges rather than to establish local exchanges that the mileage rates are charged. But the service supplied is no different whether a subscriber is connected with a local exchange or with a city exchange, which may be miles away. As the service is the same, the charge ought to be the same. Exchanges should be established according to the convenience of subscribers, not. according to the convenience of the Department; and if the Department chooses to create centres rather than have local exchanges it ought not to charge for the extra mileage. </para>

            <para>.- The honorable member for Nepean has put the question at issue very well. I will give a concrete case, the force of which will, I think, be recognised by the Postmaster-General. The regulations provide that new telephone exchanges cannot be established within  3  miles of each other. The example that I shall give will be a Victorian one. Hawthorn is a populous centre, not far from Melbourne. Camberwell is also a populous suburb of this city. Canterbury, however, is not a populous suburb. There is a telephone exchange at Canterbury. Consequently, the Canterbury residents get the benefit of a cheap telephone service. The Camberwell people, who are connected with the Canterbury exchange, have to pay extra mileage. That is to say, telephone subscribers in the populous area of Camberwell have to pay more than do telephone subscribers at Canterbury. The reason given is that, there being another exchange at Hawthorn, it is against the regulations to establish an exchange at Camberwell, and the Camberwell residents, consequently, have to be connected with the Canterbury exchange. </para>

              <para>- A  subscriber at Canterbury gets his telephone for  &#163;5  per annum.  A  subscriber who lives more than a mile from the Canterbury exchange pays &#163;6. If, however, he lives at Camberwell, he has to pay  &#163;7  per annum. Thus the telephone subscriber in Camberwell is put to extra expense because the exchange happens to be located at a less populous centre like Canterbury. Camberwell happens to be situated between the two exchanges, Hawthorn and Canterbury, and, therefore, it is not permitted to have an exchange of its own. The idea of the honorable member for Parramatta is to popularize the telephone. Does not the ex-Postmaster-General think that subscribers ought to pay for services rendered? </para>

              <para>- I believe that the ex-Postmaster-General is merely defending the policy of departmental officers. What. objection is there to establishing more exchanges? Why should there not be an exchange at Camberwell, which is a populous centre, rather than at Canterbury, which is not? What reason is there for requiring a distance of  3  miles between exchanges? I quite sympathize with the hope expressed bytheex- Postmaster-General some time ago, that people should be able to have telephones for1s.a week. I see no reason why the convenience of a telephone should be confined to the well-to-do and professional classes. I believe that the day will come when a man who desires to let his houses will have to connect them by telephone with an exchange, just as gas and water are laid on at present. Why should not a poor man or woman have all the advantages of civilization? The telephone is a convenience that should be placed at the disposal of everybody, and the more it is popularized the more productive of revenue will the system be. Take the case of the wife of a working man who, having no maid-servant, has to do her own housework. It would be very convenient for her to be able to communicate by telephone with the butcher, the grocer, and the baker. I hope the Postmaster- General will make an effort to popularize the system. If it is to be popularized the present hard and fast rule in regard to the number of exchanges must be broken down. I trust that two years hence in districts where there are now three exchanges there will be six, and that in time where there are six there will be twelve. My desire is that the poor, as well is the rich, shall have the benefit of the telephone service. I should like to know why subscribers at Camberwell should have to pay <inline font-style="italic">&#163;7</inline> or  ,&#163;8  per annum when subscribers at Canterbury, a mile distant, have to pay only <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline> per annum. When the honorable member for Parramatta held office as Postmaster-General in New South Wales, he rendered good service, and was the first to make an attempt to popularize the telephone system. He certainly supplied the suburbs with a satisfactory service. I think that it is only right that I should mention this fact, since I find that honorable members are prepared to allow party considerations to weigh with them in dealing with these matters. If the Acting Prime Minister were a subscriber he would not like to be called upon to pay <inline font-style="italic">&#163;y</inline> per -annum for the use of a telephone when a man 200 yards away from him had to pay only <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline> per annum. </para>

              <para>- I refer to the creation of an imaginary centre, where there is no telephone exchange, and no post office. To say that a subscriber should be charged as if his service came from such a centre is to suggest something that would be wrong in principle, vicious in application, and cap able, of being used in a way that no Minister should be able to use the service. At the same time I am strongly of opinion that the present arrangement must be altered. </para>

              <para>- I regard as imaginary any so-called centre, where there is no post-office or exchange. The system that I am endeavouring to work out is that every subscriber, as far as possible, should be placed on an equal footing, having regard to the cost of the service which is being rendered to him. In other words, I hold that the price should be fixed for the telephone itself. </para>

              <para>- Canterbury is one, and Richmond is another. At Kew. the charge is much higher than it is in Hawthorn, but the system must be carried out on the basis I have indicated. In preparing the estimates we have gone into the question of providing exchanges, and have endeavoured to meet the enormously increased demand&#39; for telephone services. The number of applications being received for telephones is unparalleled. We are endeavouring, as I have said, to meet these applications, but questions of the kind raised during this debate cannot be settled in a week. I promise that the matter will receive my early and earnest attention, .and that I shall endeavour to evolve a scheme that will be equitable on the basis I have indicated. </para>
