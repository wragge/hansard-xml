                    <para>- As I notice that the despatch from the Secretary of State for the Colonies relating to the re-arrangement of the Colonial Office has been made public in Great Britain, I now wish to lay it upon the table of the House. Those familiar with the proceedings of the recent Conference in London, who appreciate the. importance of the proposals submitted by the Dominions over-sea for a re-adjustment of their status, and who then read this document will be irresistibly reminded of the mountain in labour which brought forth a mouse. Let us hope that its. appearance will remind the peoples' of the Empire of the contrast between their needs and this outcome, while consoling them with the reflection that the mouse is creeping in the right direction. I lay upon the table the following paper - </para>

                            <para>- The question, however, is one that under no circumstances can be treated in a light fashion. The situation is too profoundly serious. It is because we have every desire to remain quite apart from the affray in the hope that a means of settlement will be speedily found that I must ask the honorable member not to press his question, and other honorable member's not to press similar questions. Judging. by the reports which appear in this morning's newspapers, there is every, prospect that action will, betaken by the State of New South Wales, where the dispute has arisen, which will, happily, relieve us all at an early period of this grave and impending danger. If the effort in New South Wales should fail, it will probably fall to the Commonwealth to intervene. Whatever possibilities exist in that direction are being carefully scrutinized, not with a. desire to interfere; but in the firm hope and belief that no interference or our part will be necessary. </para>

Edmondson and Co., of Wagga Wagga, to whose premises, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beveridge,</inline> the Petition had been sent for signatures to be obtained and replies have been received giving the information requested so far as available. </para>
                <para>Your Committee are of opinion that the following names attached to the Petition purporting to be signatures are not genuine signatures, but are, in fact, forgeries, viz. - " Alfred Deakin, Melbourne." " Harry Foran, Dom., Sydney." " May Francis, Crown-street, Sydney." " Beattie Booth, Reservoir-street, Sydney." " H. C. Walker, Customs House, Sydney." </para>
                <para>Your Committee find that at the bottom of page 2 of the Petition there has been written in ink what purports to be " W. J. Lyne, Sydney." An attempt has been made to cover this writing with ink, notwithstanding which the name, and address are still visible in outline. Your Committee are of opinion that this also is a forgery; </para>
                <para>The information received in reply to the letters above referred to in the opinion of your Committee points to a certain individual as the perpetrator of the forgeries. It is recommended that the Crown Law authorities should be requested to take action with a view to a criminal prosecution of the offender, and that the correspondence in the possession of the Committee be placed at their disposal for that purpose. </para>

                            <para>- I am quite aware of that. I believe that it is possible that the Senate will adjourn at a very early date for a prolonged period, and if we make any amendments in this Bill, unless they are dealt with by the other Chamber before that adjournment takes place, the settlement of the whole matter will be deferred. Seeing that the Senate has agreed to refer the matter involved in the measure to the High Court for decision the sooner it is determined the better, in justice to both parties. </para>

                            <para>- The Government is quite satisfied, on the advice of its law officers, of the validity of the measures which have been introduced, sometimes referred to as the new protection legislation. An invitation has recently been publicly given - though not by any member of the Government, or by Parliament - to those who feel themselves in any way aggrieved, to test the constitutionality of the existing legislation. No doubt that invitation will be responded to; indeed, to use a Hibernianism, it would doubtless have been responded to if it had never been issued. </para>

                        <para>- I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether he has observed the complexities which are arising in connexion with the fixing of wages under the Excise Tariff Acts. Quite a number of tribunals are now determining the wages conditions of various industries. In the first place, I understand that two different rates have been fixed by the Justices of the High Court. Then the Minister of Trade and Customs is discharging a similar function. Further, Parliament may fix wages in certain industries if it wishes, and, in addition, a similar duty is being performed by the Wages Boards of the States. I am sure that the Prime Minister will recognise the complexities which this condition of affairs is creating. I should like to know whether he has observed it, and, if so, whether in any contemplated legislation, means will be taken to avoid it. . </para>

So far as I can form a judgment at the present time, it will be necessary, when the House meets after the Christmas adjournment, or as soon after as the information in our possession will admit, to submit a short measure dealing with these different standards of wages, and also with the retrospective operation of the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act prior to the declaration by the  President  of the Arbitration Court of the scale of wages which he has approved in the agricultural implement industry. </para>

All concerned have already been invited to send in these communications. This morning I saw a small country manufacturer for the purpose of explaining the position to him, and he has, in the frankest fashion, put his position before me. It will be necessary for others to do the same. The Government will then be prepared to submit a proposal which will inflict no hardship upon those who have honestly done their best to comply with the law. </para>

It may be said that there is a general hardship ; and, if so, that will require to be dealt with by general provisions. But there may be specific cases of hardship in the application of the Act in, country districts, or where there are two sets of wages, as across the borders of States, to which the honorable member for North Sydney has called attention. </para>

Whatever we may do as to the past, the manufacturers have now a clear indication from the Court of what are considered fair and rear sonable rates, and I think it would be only fair- </para>

I may add that yesterday, and again to; day, I saw the head of the Department; and authorized him to convey to manufacturers, who were not present at the deputation, an exactly similar intimation - that from the date of the publication of the award, the scale of wages therein must be observed. </para>

A Committee of Inquiry has been sitting in connexion with this question of stamps, and I have the report of that Committee before me. I have not had time, however, to deal with the matter, or to consult the Postmaster-General in regard to it. On the class of stamps determined upon, and how they are printed, will depend the answers to nearly the whole of the questions- asked; and when a decision has been arrived at in this connexion, I shall answer the honorable member. I desire to consult the Postmaster-General before any action is taken by the Treasury. </para>

                        <para>- But it has already been explained how this item came to be recommended by that section of the Commission. To my mind, it was foolish for the free-trade section of the Commission to attempt to frame a Tariff. However, they did so, and the duty recommended in this case being part of a general scheme was to go for nought if that scheme were not adopted. The honorable member therefore, was hardly fair in alluding to this as the recommendation of the. free-trade section of the Commission, without qualifying that statement in the way I have indicated. Most of the goods in this item are either minor articles used in manufactures, or for ordinary household purposes or are used by women reduced to the unfortunate position of having to battle for their existence. This statement applies more particularly to typewriters and sewing machines. The Government propose a preference of 10 per cent. on goods imported from the United Kingdom, but as a matter of fact, we,.; do not import sewing machines in any quantity from the Old Country. The total value of imports under this heading in . 1906 was £140, 877, of which only £13,608 came from the United Kingdom. But -that sum of £13,608 covered few, if any, sewing machines. For the most part, it represented stitching and knitting ; machines; which are included in this item. The bulk  of our importations of sewing machines come from America and Germany, and are excellent productions. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member and his followers generally tune their political fiddles to the note struck by that newspaper. It was in recognition of the fact that sewing machines are used chiefly by the poorer classes of the community, and are necessary to enable many poor women to earn a living, that, in response to a tremendous protest, the New Zealand Government removed the duty of 10 per cent. </para>

Careful inquiry made in connexion with the preparation of this article goes to prove, by actual extracts from the city ledgers of a leading firm of sewing machine importers, that it is the " working " and poorer classes who are the principal purchasers of sewing machines, especially on the extended payment system. An analysis of the last thousand town customers in this direction (farmers and country folk generally not appearing in the list) give the following results : - </para>

                    <para>- - Personally, I do not think that it matters much whether we do or do not impose a duty of 10 per cent, on foreign importations of sewing machines, to give a preference to Great Britain; but I am surprised that the honorable member for Lang and the members of the party to which he belongs have not shown more concern about the robbery of sempstresses and other poor persons who need sewing machines, and have to pay extortionate prices for them. When Parliament was considering how best to protect certain local manufacturers  from unfair competition from abroad, tons of documents and protests were produced, and the members of the Opposition were perfervid in their declarations' against the iniquity of the proceeding, because, they alleged, prices were being charged for the locally-made articles quite disproportionate to their cost. But, in this instance, apparently because it is the importers who are making exorbitant charges, not a word is said on the subject. </para>

                        <para>- I did not suggest 'that the honorable member should refrain from saying what it was necessary to say in this regard. Sewing machines which are sold for ^12 and ^15 each are invoiced at about <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> 10s. each, the average invoice cost of sewing machines with their appurtenances and fixings being less than <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> each, so that the purchasers are robbed to the extent of about 500 per cent. The honorable member for Lang is wildly excited by the proposal to charge a duty of io per cent, on the invoice cost of foreign machines, which would come to about 4s. each, but he and other members of the Opposition seem to regard it as of no importance that the importers' make a profit of from <inline font-style="italic">£10</inline> to <inline font-style="italic">£12</inline> on each machine. </para>

                            or for any one else ; but it seems to me that the prices of sewing machines are out of all proportion to their cost, and I am surprised that honorable members who have made such a noise about the proposed duty have nothing to say about the action of importers in charging so much for their machines.

                    <para>. - I was rather astonished at the fierce attack of the honorable member for South Sydney on the honorable member for Lang. We are dealing with a proposal' to impose a duty on foreign sewing machines, and the question of selling price did not arise. But may I point out to the honorable member for. South Sydney that, when it had been pointed out by the Opposition that Australian manufacturers had by combination been taking advantage of duties, and would do so still further if rates were increased, he and those with him, merely said " We can. deal with combines." </para>

                        <para>- I am referring, not to harvesters, but to other manufactures protected by high duties. Similarly, I would point out that there is on the statute-book an Act to prevent what the honorable member for South Sydney has complained of, and therefore it seems to me that the honorable member for Lang is not to be blamed for not having referred to the matter. I am not here to support the importers, but, in reply to what the honorable member has said, I would mention that I have myself bought good family sewing machines for  £6  each. Of course, there may be much more highly-priced machines. </para>

                        <para>- I. know that the honorable member would not wilfully misrepresent the matter. But if prices are as high as he says, why do not Australian manufacturers take advantage of them, and, by importing and assembling here the parts, which they can bring in free of duty, share in the enormous profits. It is not necessary to erect an extensive plant for the manufacture of sewing machines ; all that has to be done is to assemble imported parts. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; anyone can , get them. The proposed dutv is not protective in its incidence, because there is no duty on British importations, and it is admitted that we cannot compete with' them. The honorable member who has- moved the amendment wishes to prevent the price of imported foreign machines from being increased, and I think that he is right in the action which he has taken. </para>

                    <para>.- This is an old subject with me. I remember that, when the last Tariff was under discussion, the honorable member for Adelaide gave way on the duty on sewing machines without calling for a division, while the proposal to make stands dutiable was negatived on division. I have been informed that machines which cost £13 10s. are invoiced f.o.b. at , £4 17s. 6d. It must be remembered that machines vary a good deal - some, are very plain, while others have a lot of fancy work about them. </para>

                        <para>-The duty would come to much more than that on a machine invoiced at £4. It must be remembered that the parts of machines can be imported free of duty. I ask the Treasurer whether sewing machines are a fair subject for taxation? Hundreds of other tools of trade have already been placed upon the free list and I do not know why the women workers of the Commonwealth should be subjected to a special disability in the shape of a duty of 10 per cent. As a matter of fact sewing machines comprised one of the items in respect of which the Premier of New Zealand on the representations of the Labour Party of the Dominion refused to accord preferential treatment to the Mother Country. In almost every village throughout the Commonwealth women are operating these machines as their tools of trade. I trust that the Treasurer will see his way clear to place them upon the free list. When we were discussing the duty upon cream separators yesterday the honorable gentleman requested the postponement of the item because he practically admitted that there was a consensus of opinion amongst honorable members that these articles should be admitted free. I venture to say that sewing machines are used to a much greater extent in the Commonwealth than are cream separators, and if it is fair to place the latter upon the free list surely the former should be included in the same category. I ask the Treasurer whether he seriously desires to levy this duty of 10 per cent. upon sewing machines ? </para>

                    <para>. - I do not care very much whether sewing machines are made dutiable or not, but I am opposed to their importation from foreign countries when we can obtain them from Great Britain. I find that the importations under this heading are valued at £179,000, of which only £14,000 worth are of British origin. The balance comes chiefly from Germany and the United States. </para>

                    <para>. - I find it most difficult to accept the statement of the Treasurer that an important lot of machines, which were admitted free under the old Tariff, were inadvertently made dutiable under this Tariff. I cannot accept his statement that, as the result of inadvertence, important machinery like printing machinery, which under the old Tariff was admitted free, was taken out of the free list and placed under a dutiable item. I cannot believe that the Department is in such a state. Blackfellows would not make a mistake of that kind. It is a monstrous thing. Was it the result of a mistake that a schedule was inserted in this Tariff under which hat and woollen mills were granted a refund of the duty which they are called upon to pay on their machinery? </para>

                        <para>- The old Tariff did not provide that they should first pay the duty and then get it back. I have too high an opinion of the officers of the Customs Department to imagine that they could make an omission of this kind by accident. They must have done what they did by design. We do not expect mistakes of this sort to be made in a Tariff. In reference to sewing machines, I hold in my hand a publication which was issued upon the day that the Tariff was introduced, and which sets out hundreds of the tools of trade of protected industries upon the free list. But amongst these I can find only one connected with the farming industry - I refer to scythes. That is the only implement of the agricultural industry which has been exempted from duty. I ask honorable members to get a copy of this by-law, and to compare all the tools of trade of industries enjoying a protection of  30  and  40  per cent. which have been put upon the free list with the tools of trade of the agricultural industry which are being made free. Sewing machines are undoubtedly a tool of trade of the weakest portion of the community. I observe that about fifty different machines used in the bookbinding trade, and about  100  tools and machines used in the paper-finishing, saddlery trades, and so forth, are free; I suppose that, altogether, about  1,000  tools and machines of trade are made free by departmental regulation. I am glad that the Minister intends to accept the amendment which has been proposed.. The high prices which are charged for sewing machines represent a most odious sort of extortion ; but imposing a duty would not mend matters. </para>

                    <para>. - I am glad that the Treasurer has consented to accept the amendment of the honorable member for Lang, and thus place sewing machines on the. free list. The Treasurer has told us that he desires to put a number of other items on the free list ; and, in view of that fact, seeing that item 155 has been postponed, I suggest that the item now under consideration should also be postponed. I desire to say a few words on behalf of the engineering industry, considering that so much consideration and protection has been extended to the woollen, hat and other industries. Speaking from memory, I should say that the engineering establishments of Australia could produce some, if not the whole, of the items which the Treasurer has intimated his desire to place on the free list. </para>

                        <para>- High protection is given to the woollen industry and to the hat industry, and yet those who benefit from the high duties grudge protection to the local makers of tools and machinery. I should say that any one who posed as a protectionist would give the utmost consideration to the iron and engineering industries, which are the basis of all other industries. Yet we find the Treasurer proposing to place on the free list many articles which are made by moulders, brass-workers, blacksmiths, and others. These men arid their families have to pay heavy duties on apparel and other necessaries of life, and yet they are denied any assistance under the Tariff. </para>

                        <para>- I have already said that probably I could make a better protectionist speech than could the Treasurer, and honorable members know that my stated intention was, if the policy of the Commonwealth had to be protection, to see that the industries in my electorate have a share. Under the Tariff the jewellery trade is highly protected, and yet jewellers' lathes are to be admitted free, although such lathes are a finished product of an industry within the Commonwealth. Surely it cannot be pretended that Australia cannot produce rolled shells or steel rollers for flour mills. </para>

                <para class="block">New South Wales. I am very strongly tempted to move that this item be postponed. Surely the Treasurer will admit that there is good reason to believe that some of the machines that he proposes to exempt could be made in Australia. The matter is worthy of consideration, and the artisans and mechanics concerned who have to pay a duty of 100 per cent, on hats will certainly be anxious to know what he has done to assist them. The Treasurer ought to be prepared to do for the secondary industries that which he is ready to do for the primary industries. </para>

                    <para>. - The question of the duty on sewing machines is not now of any importance since the Minister has agreed to place them on the free list ; but it seems to me that the general policy of exempting machines known as tools of trade from any duty is being carried by the present Government to what from a protectionist stand-point is an extraordinary extreme. It will be found that quite a number of machines included in the list referred to by the honorable member for East Sydney are not difficult to manufacture. They have not been made locally, because no encouragement has been offered to local engineers to produce them. They have been free, and have been so easily obtainable from abroad that no manufacturer in Australia has cared to embark upon the enterprise of making them. Some tools of trade, however, have been made in Australia. If the Treasurer pays. a visit to the Newport Railway Workshops, he will find that a large proportion of the machine tools in use there were made on the premises. In the same way, quite a number of engineering firms in Sydney make their own tools. Whilst I do not think it would be justifiable to impose a high duty upon machines that are not generally made here, I think it is equally unwise to exempt them. In doing so, we give no encouragement to Australian engineering firms. </para>

The word " patented " still appears upon many of them, but in a number of cases the patent rights have expired. Protection should not be granted to manufacturers abroad unless within a certain time they set up manufactories in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so ; but, holding these views, I do not sympathize with the idea that we should necessarily exempt from duty anything patented abroad. It is all very well for those who believe-wi certain machines, such as those used in hat making, being free from duty to refer specially to them, but we must not overlook the fact that these exemptions in the aggregate affect to an enormous extent the possibilities of development in the engineering trade. Machines of the value of hundreds of thousands of pounds are exempt as " flop Ls of trade," or as not being made in Australia. If we are to have any adequate development of the secondary industries in iron we must impose some duty. </para>

                        <para>- No. I admit that at present many of these tools are not made in Australia; but protectionists cannot overlook the fact that we are unlikely to have any development of the engineering industry if we persist in putting all tools of trade on the free list. </para>

                        <para>- In some cases it would not be sufficient; but in any event it would not be a serious tax upon those who use such machinery. I do not think that protected manufacturers should complain of a desire on our part to give a little assistance to engineers who can manufacture the machinery which they use. For that reason I would urge the Government in regard, not to this item alone, but to the exemption, of machinery generally, to consider; the desirability of imposing a moderate duty. T.o view the matter from another stand-point, I would remind the Committee that we have -imposed a - number of - revenue duties upon articles which are in daily demand by the general masses of the community. If we» need revenue duties, it is much better to impose them on articles which may be produced in Australia, although they are not being made here at present, than oh actual necessities of the poorest section of the population. From that stand-point alone the Government might fairly well reconsider the position in regard to these exemptions. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for South Sydney has raised a point which undoubtedly ought to be of considerable interest to protectionists., but of which protectionists, as a rule, have fought shy. I was very glad to hear the honorable member indorse what was practically the opinion expressed by the freetrade section of the Commission in regard to the exemption of tools of trade. We were struck by the anomalies in relation to these exemptions. We found that whilst tools of trade used in certain industries were on the free list, others were taxed. The anomaly appeared the more extraordinary when we found that almost invariably those industries which derived no advantage from protective duties were taxed in respect of their tools of trade, whilst protected industries obtained  them free. The honorable member for South Sydney has said very forcibly that if the engineering industries of Australia could only secure the making of a proportion of the tools- of trade, which, for the benefit of protected industries, are allowed to come in free, there would be very little complaint of depression amongst them. The quantity of machinery so introduced is enormous. Undoubtedly there is force in the observation that whilst, perhaps, a prohibitive duty would entail hardship on those who must neces-sarily obtain their tools of trade from abroad, still a moderate duty could be imposed which would produce revenue, and at the .same time lead to an expansion of production in the engineering trade of Australia, in those directions where any chance of success is probable. Although the freetrade section of the Commission, according to the comparative table circulated amongst honorable members, recommended a duty of  10  per cent, on this item, its intention undoubtedly was that it should remain, as under the old Tariff, free. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member for South Sydney has anticipated a great deal of what I had intended to say, and I shall not repeat his arguments. The iron industry and its associated manufactures come next in importance to the primary industries, and are probably the most helpful that any country could possess. There is a good deal in the suggestion of the honorable member for South Sydney that practically all these tools of trade should bear some duty. There are some machines, such as printing and' sewing machines and a few others, so complex that it would be idle to tax them, because their output in Australia would necessarily be very limited. </para>

                        <para>- Very many tools of trade which are now on the free list could be made in Australia, and their manufacture here would give far more employment than many of the industries for the encouragement of which the Treasurer has been fighting so hard. Every additional tool of trade made in the Commonwealth means the introduction of special machinery,' and the possibility of still more machinery being produced in the Commonwealth. The introduction of one machine perhaps enables a number of others to be produced here. For what reason have fire engines been placed on the free list? They could be made here as well as most mining engines, and we make locomotives, which are the most complex of all engines. </para>

                    <para>.- I am in the main in agreement with the general policy in regard to tools of trade adopted by previous Governments and followed by this one. No doubt the Australian people wish to endeavour to produce as much as possible of their own requirements, and I think it a good thing to give reasonable protection to local manufacture. But if we penalize the importation of machine tools necessary for manufacture of one kind or another, we shall be hampering instead of encouraging local production. Many machine tools are turned out by firms which have specialized their production, and have the world for their market. </para>

                        <para>- For certain lines the Australian market is so small that it would not pay them to do so. We could manufacture battleships or any other propositions if we were prepared to pay sufficiently for them ; but it is wiser to centre our efforts on the production of what we can make economically, and to give our manufacturers an opportunity to take advantage of the skill and specialization of manufacturers abroad. As our plants extend we shall extend our manufacture, even of special tools ; and patent rights will expire. But it would be bad policy to penalize now the importation of tools of trade whose manufacture is protected by patent rights and carried out by specialized processes. There are many articles in the list of the Treasurer which could not be made without a special plant, and for which the demand is too small to make their manufacture in Australia profitable. I intend not to vote for revenue duties, and I shall oppose duties which, while giving a little protection, are really revenue-producing in their incidence. But I am willing to give reasonable protection to the encouragement and assistance of manufacture, though without hampering our manufacturers or primary producers by imposing duties on tools of trade and other necessaries of the mining and agricultural industries which cannot profitably be made here. The Minister has consented to place sewing machines, typewriters, and other similar machines on the free list, because there is no reasonable expectation that they will be made here in the near future. </para>

                        <para>- It is easy to make an assertion of. that kind, but, as men of affairs, we must be guided by experience in determining what is possible. In my juvenile days I started out to make a steam engine, but I am satisfied that, had I completed it, it would not have been suitable for driving some of the plants which are used by our great primary industries. I am in thorough agreement with the proposals of the Government generally ; but I believe in exempting tools of trade and other machinery which cannot be made here, set out in this and in subsequent items. </para>

In a letter which I have received from the Otto C. Schumacher Mill Furnishing Works - the only manufacturers of flour-milling machinery in Victoria - it is pointed out that- </para>

                    <para>These steel rolls are the principal parts of roller mills, and' are at present not manufactured in Australia, and but very few indeed in England, and these, by the way, are inferior to other makes. </para>

                <para class="block">When the Bounties Bill was before us we were supplied with a report in which attention was drawn to the great value of the flour-milling industry, an industry of such value to the country that it was stated that there was a desire to recommend a bounty for the production of flour for human consumption and offals for the use of agriculturists and dairymen. We recognise the advantage of manufacturing all that we can, and I am prepared to give reasonable protection for the assistance of manufacturers. But we shall depart from the. true principles of protection if we levy taxation on articles which cannot be manufactured here. The Schumacher Company advocate a duty of  25  per. cent, on steel rolls ; but it seems to me that they do so on purely selfish grounds. They urge that if the duty upon this article be retained at  10  per cent., and if the frames of the machines are subject to a  25  per cent. rate, the machines will be imported in parts, and the parts will be assembled here. That will provide a certain amount of employment, no doubt. </para>

                        <para>- I am not arguing this question from, a selfish stand-point, because I have a flour mill which is equipped with everything that is necessary in the way of machinery. But if the manufacture of flour ought to be encouraged, it should be. encouraged by admitting free those articles which cannot be manufactured locally. I should like to add that my sympathies are. entirely with the .sempstresses and others who -are required to use sewing machines. As we do not manufacture these articles, it seems to be a very harsh proceeding to levy a duty of  10  per cent, upon them. </para>

                    (Melbourne Ports&gt;-  [12.34].  - So far, we have not attempted to manufacture porcelain rollers for flour mills, but there is a plant at Port Melbourne for the manufacture of the steel rollers. I admit that the firm in' question? is not making them now. The reason is that its members resemble certain other protectionists who, whilst desiring their own industry to be protected, wish to obtain their raw material - which Is the finished article of another industry - as cheaply as possible. Surely the mechanical skill required, to produce a steel roller is not beyond Australians. These rollers are not being manufactured to any extent in Great Britain, and the whole of those used in the Commonwealth are imported from Germany.

                    <para>- Yes. But, in this connexion, I regard Austria and Germany as one country. Of course, we have been told that it is impossible to properly temper the steel in Australia. That is all moonshine. A good deal has been said in reference to subjecting the users of sewing machines to a disability by levying a 10 per cent, rate upon them. Are honorable members aware that if a duty had been placed upon these machines thirty years ago, they would have been selling in Australia to-day for half their present price? I know perfectly well that in Sydney and Melbourne 'there is a firm which alleges that it manufactures sewing machines. But, as a matter of fact, it merely imports the parts and puts them together here. I admit that it also "does a certain amount of moulding work. The reason that the price of sewing machines in Australia has not been reduced is that they are not manufactured here. </para>

                        <para>- They are not. Of each machine alleged to be made within the 'Commonwealth, not one-fourth of the parts are so .made. A machine which is sold for <inline font-style="italic">£12</inline> 10s. upon the time-payment system cannot be purchased for <inline font-style="italic">£10</inline> cash. Yet that machine landed in Australia costs only about 5s. The position in regard to' the price of rollers for flour mills and printing machines is an exactly similar one. If these articles were protected the imported article would be much cheaper than it is now. I hold that there is nothing remarkable in the process of manufacturing these rollers. Some of them are turned out plain, and others are corrugated, but as a matter of fact the corrugation upon them does not last. What do the Victorian millers do? They send their rollers to be re-corrugated and re-set bv a firm in my electorate. Instead of imposing a duty of 10 per cent, upon these articles, the Treasurer should have subjected them to a 25 per cent, rate under the General Tariff, and to a 15 per cent, duty under the Tariff for the United Kingdom. Experience has shown that wherever a duty has been levied upon an article which has encouraged its local production, the result has always been to reduce- the price for the imported article. </para>

                        <para>- If we wish to. exclude black labour, it is essential that we should impose high duties upon articles in the production of which it would be engaged. What is the use of protecting a whole machine if we allow its parts to be admitted free? Unless we can manufacture the articles specified in this item, it is useless for us to talk about becoming a nation, especially in view of the fact that the iron industry is the most 'stable industry that we can establish. We should be very careful about admitting free of duty parts of machines which can be manufactured locally. Seeing that the manufacture of steel rollers for. flour mills and for printing machinery would absorb such an enormous quantity of iron, I hope that the Treasurer will see his way to transfer this line to another item, under which it will be dutiable at a higher rate than that proposed. </para>

                    <para>.- I think I can claim to be a fairly strong protectionist, but, at the .same time, in imposing protective duties on tools of trade or parts thereof, a certain amount of discrimination should, in my opinion, be exercised. If we accept the advice of the honorable member' for South Sydney, and impose a duty, with a view to some possible speculative effect, we may thereby place a heavy burden on industries already established. The time may come when- we can expand the area of tools of trade, on which protective duties are imposed, but, in the meantime, it is a fair proposition to place duties on such tools or parts thereof as can be fairly and reasonably produced or manufactured in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- Up to the present, steel rollers have not been fairly and reasonably produced here; and, therefore, I think that the proposal to eliminate porcelain and steel rollers for flour mills is unfair and unreasonable, and ought not to be entertained. There is a duty of 25 per cent, on flour roller machinery - that is, on the machine itself - and if porcelain and steam rollers are embodied in the complete machine, they are liable to that duty. </para>

There is a. duty of 25 per cent, on the complete machine, and that ought to be enough. I utterly disagree with the view presented by the honorable member for South Sydney that we ought to place an all-round duty on machine tools and parts. We ought to exercise a certain amount of discrimination and judgment. Item 166 covers the whole of the applications which were made for protection ; and I am not prepared to support any. duty which has not been applied for by manufacturers in Australia. We should only comply with applications which are fairly and reasonably supported by evidence. The principal maker is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gideon</inline> James, of Melbourne, and he has obtained nearly every duty he asked for ; and I do not think we ought to go further and grant duties on tools of trade, and so forth, which at present are not made in Australia. </para>

                    <para>.- It appears to me from the discussion that a number of honorable members' desire the Treasurer to completely remodel the tariff. Seeing, however, that, after a long discussion, we have disposed of about one-third of the items, it is too late in the day to make any such . change. The Tariff has been arranged on general lines which are very well understood ; and it comes before us as the result of a Commission appointed to inquire into  the  operation of the previous Tariff on existing industries. But some protectionists seem to have an idea that we have only to impose a duty to have, like the result- of a stroke from a fairy wand, industries springing up all round us. While I look upon private enterprise as one of the failures . of our social system, I may point out that -no one engages in. commercial business as a mere matter of philanthropy, especially when it is sought to introduce a new line, which has to come into competition, with the existing supply. Tools of trade are supplied in . a certain . way already ; and it would be a big undertaking to now endeavour to secure the market by. means of a new venture, apart altogether from the question of being able to produce the commodities at a competing price. Firms have their connexions and financial arrangements with wholesale houses, and sometimes these arrangements are such as to place them in the grip of the big manufacturer or importing firm, as the case may be. Under such circumstances; a firm takes the line that is most profitable. Any one with capital to invest does not go round looking for some direction in which he may do a good turn to the community, but embarks on the enterprise which is likely to prove the most remunerative. I support the views expressed by the honorable member for Bendigo. Tools of trade have to be replaced, and this cost has been calculated in the imposition of the duties. To impose a duty on tools of trade would have much the Same result as imposing duties on raw materials ; and I hope the Treasurer will adhere to the principle of confining his attention to industries already in existence. If it be desired to impose a protective duty, with a view <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> encouraging the starting of an industry, that duty ought not to become operative until the industry is started. I have a strong objection to duties on articles which are not made or are not likely to be made profitably in Australia. Until our population is much greater we cannot hope to make Australia self-contained or self-supporting. The honorable member for Melbourne Ports has urged that the imposition of a duty immediately lowers prices. </para>

                        <para>- Of course, we know that firms and establishments, like the Newport workshops, for example, make their own tools of trade; but that is very different from making tools for sale by merchants and retailers. I support what has been said in favour of making sewing machines free. We know that sewing machines invoiced, here at 50s. are sold at fourteen guineas. There is no doubt that the organization of vendors is very complete; and I think it is a cruel system which insists on the breaking up of a second-hand machine, however good it may be, so that prices may be kept up. This is only one of the cruel wastes of the competitive system. I would be prepared to vote for the Government proposal of preference, because the great Singer company manufacture in Great Britain ; and, as a tool of trade, the sewing machine is just as important as any other.I do not know that a duty would make any difference in the prices, but I am glad that the Treasurer is prepared to give way. </para>

                        <para>- What change of circumstances has since taken place ? I am not aware that wrought pipes of 6 inches diameter and under may be made in Australia. The larger pipes are made here, and their manufacture is protected. If pipes of up to 6 inches in diameter are not made in Australia, then the duty will add to the cost of many undertakings the price of which it is not desirable to increase. </para>

                    <para>.- Surely it will not be contended that we cannot make these bolts in Australia. Bolt-making machines are very simple contrivances, and the quantity of bolts used must be very large. We must use more of the smaller than of the larger sizes. I suggest that the duty be raised to 10 or 15 per cent. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that these cylinders should be admitted free. They cost £3, £4, and£5 each, so that they are infinitely more valuable than their contents, and the holding of a stock of them is a tremendous charge. As the Minister has pointed out, we are now beginning to export gas in them. The English cylinders are hardly used in Australia, being bulkier and heavier than the German cylinders, which latter are tested to prove that they will withstand the necessary pressure. The use of British cylinders would mean more in carriage, and would generally prove more expensive. </para>

                    <para>.- I fail to recognise the utility of levying a duty of 5 per cent. under the General Tariff upon locks. Either they should be admitted free, or a sufficient duty should be imposed upon them to induce persons to manufacture them locally. Under item 186 barbed wire is dutiable at 36 per cent.' under the General Tariff, and at 20 per cent. under the Tariff of the United Kingdom. Does anybody seriously suggest that there is as much skill required in the making of barbed wire as there is in the manufacture of locks? Why, a Chinaman could make barbed wire, whereas the manufacture of locks necessitates the employment of a great deal of skill. There is nothing whatever to prevent persons in the Commonwealth from making keys, locks; and escutcheons, and yet it is proposed to levy a duty of only 5 per cent. upon them. Surely (here should be some system followed in dealing with this Tariff.. The Treasurer wishes to stimulate native industries, but because nobody has waited upon him,' and told him all about the manufacture of locks, he has not bothered to ascertain whether or not they can be made locally. . As a matter of fact, they can be manufactured in the Commonwealth. </para>

It was urged by certain persons in the United States that this article and that article could not be made locally. I recollect the experience of the tin-plate industry in this  connexion. It was said that tin plates could not be made in America, but to-day that industry is one of the greatest in the country, simply (because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKinley</inline> gave it the benefit of a heavy protective duty.

                    <para>. - I do not see any reason whatever for the amendment. A slug is simply a piece of lead which is thicker than the ordinary lead which is placed between the metal types. It must be a much more difficult matter to make ' leads of varying thicknesses than it is to make slugs, and it is easy enough to make the former. It is quite absurd to omit slugs from this item. </para>

                        <para>- That cannot be, or, if so, it should not be described as "tin plates," because tin plates are a well-known article of commerce. These plates are brought in as plates tinned, and if a duty be imposed the packing industry in Australia will be heavily taxed. I am sure that tinned plates are meant, because no iron plates are brought in here for tinning. If it does not mean tin plates, then tin plates must be under a heavy duty in another part of the Tariff. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Darwin desires to see the tin-plate industry encouraged here, in view of the fact that enormous quantities of tin are produced in Australia. These are really iron plates covered with a strong surface of tin ; and it is with a view to encourage the industry that the honorable member for Darwin suggests a postponement of the item, so that fuller information may be obtained. I remember very well how the McKinley Tariff so built up this industry in America that the imports from England were absolutely destroyed. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Melbourne is a little wrong in his facts. Under the McKinley Tariff an effort was made to establish the tin-plate industry in the United States, but Titus Salt, the world-famed manufacturer of Wales, got into the American market in spite of the Tariff, and to-day Wales supplies the bulk of the tin plate there used. When we find that the manufacturers in a highly protected country like the United States cannot compete with the Welsh makers, how can we expect the Australian manufacturers to compete? Any duty imposed will simply be a tax on those who use the plate. </para>

                    <para>.- This item is so important that I agree with the honorable member for Darwin in his suggestion for a postponement. In the tin industry here the primary workers suffer a severe injustice, getting little more than half the value of the product. The tin dipping, at least, ought to be done in Australia, and some effort made to regulate prices in a proper way. At the present time the workers are absolutely at the mercy of agents. We have been told that the American manufacturers failed ; but, if so, that must have been on account of a trade secret, or some other special reason. </para>

                    <para>.- Honorable members should realize that the tin plate, to which this item relates, is an absolute necessity to many of our local industries. Preserves, butter, and various other commodities, are packed in vessels made of tin, the plate which is imported for this purpose being known on the market as the "I.C. Coke" and "Charcoal" tin. I certainly should like to see the industry established in Australia, but we cannot lose sight of the fact that the cost of the necessary plant would be very great. The value of our imports of plain tin plate last year was £258,000, and probably a properly equipped tin-plate mill would involve an expenditure of about £250.000. </para>

                        <para>- But that is a very different industry. The proposal to impose a duty of even 5 per cent. on foreign imports is to my mind a mistake, since it is practically impossible at the present time to establish the industry here, the scope for it not being wide enough. My honorable friend was mistaken when he said that the United States of America had failed to establish the industry. They unquestionably established it, and did so by means of a duty. The difference between their position and ours, however, is that they had a market of 60,000,000 of people to work upon, whilst we have a population of only 4,000,000. We might well agree to the item as it stands, and possibly, when our population has increased by a few millions, we shall have tin-plate mills in Australia. </para>

                    <para>. -The honorable member for Dalley was labouring under a multiplicity of delusions when he said that the tin-plate industry in the United States of America was a failure. What happened was that the Welsh tin manufacturers for the time being lost their market as the result of the establishment of the industry in the States, and many of them proceeded to America and set up business there. The United States of America is now able to supply itself with all the tin plate that it requires. </para>

                        <para>- The Treasurer ought to agree to the postponement of this item, which has a bearing on the iron industry, until we have dealt with the Manufactures Encouragement Bill. If that Bill is designed to give special privileges to a section of the people at the expense of the rest of the community, then I am opposed to it. I am a protectionist because the policy of protection enables the  community to build up industries for the benefit of the whole of the people. I do not favour protection for any special industry or special class or corporation, but I believe that a general policy of protection cannot fail to be beneficial. I hope that the item will be postponed. </para>

                    <para>.- This item has some relation to the iron industrv. since sheet iron is the basis of tin plate. If honorable members believe that iron will be imported and tinned out here, I think they are mistaken; there would be a risk of deterioration on the voyage. On the other hand, I have not heard of any proposal on the part of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandford</inline> or any one else interested in the iron industry to enter upon the manufacture of tin plates. I do not think we shall be able to utilize for some years our production of tin, and we must not forget that this material is used in nearly all our industries. Even the farmer requires tin for his stencil plates for branding purposes. I do not think that we should increase the duty. I should not object to the item appearing in division VI. a, so that the duty would come into operation when the industry of making tin plates had been established locally ; but I do not think that we can hope for its establishment in the Commonwealth for some time. </para>

                    <para>.- I rise to support the statement made by the honorable member for Darwin. When it was first proposed under the McKinley Tariff to establish the tin-plate industry in the United States of America, arguments similar to those just advanced by the honorable member for Mernda were heard all over England and America. It was said that it was a farce to impose a duty on tin plate, and thousands of dollars were offered to the first man who could produce a comparatively small quantity. One of the arguments used by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> during his Tariff campaign of 1903 was that the tin-plate industry in the United States of America, which was so despised six or seven years before, was actually exporting plate to Wales. </para>

                        <para>- The State of Queensland, with a deduction of , £4,800 paid by the Commonwealth for mileage. Having regard to our recent experience with an extremely promising contract, which was not carried out, under circumstances into which it is not now necessary to enter, the Government has reviewed all the old terms in order to obtain a contract more applicable to the conditions of the Commonwealth, and more in consonance with the desires of the representatives of the States. Instead of agreeing to pay £146,000 for a mere service to Adelaide of 696 hours, with several old boats, and a general Undertaking to provide cool storage space, we have made a more elaborate contract for an entirely new service, a copy of which I shall lay on the table, briefly summarizing its principal terms. The. proposed contract is for a term of ten years, commencing in February, 1910. A subsidy of £170,000 is to be paid for a complete Australian service, making Brisbane the final port of call. The route to be followed by the mail steamers is to be from an approved port in the United Kingdom, connecting at Brindisi probably, passing through the Suez Canal, and calling at Colombo, Fremantle, Adelaide, Melbourne, and Sydney, to Brisbane, returning on the same track, subject to a condition in regard to Hobart, to which I shall presently allude. The time of journey from Brindisi to Adelaide is to be reduced to 638 hours, or fifty-eight hours less than is required by the present contract, and from Adelaide to Brindisi to 650 hours, both periods being the same as are provided for in the latest contract between the British Government and the Peninsular and Oriental Company. Consequently, under the proposed contract we shall obtain what Australia has never enjoyed hitherto-a much quicker service and uniform weekly arrivals of the mail boats, so as to permit of letters being answered, even from Brisbane, by return post. The proposed subsidy will be a little less than is now paid,  taking £25,000 for an increase of speed, and £26,000 for the service to Brisbane; besides which we obtain all the further advantages which I am about to enumerate. </para>

                        <para>- It must be remembered that, under the proposed contract, the service will be carried on by a much better class of boats, at a higher rate of speed, and under many other advantageous conditions. The new service is to be commenced with five new steamers, each of not less than 11,000 tons register, possessing a speed of at least 17 knots an hour, and built to plans and specifications approved by the Government. In each steamer not less than 2,000 tons of insulated space must be provided, allowing 40 cubic feet to the <inline font-style="italic">ton.</inline> At the present time, the insulated space on the Orient mail steamers is in" some cases less than1,000 tons, and - if my memory serves' me aright - in no instance exceeds 1,700 tons. An additional new steamer, equal in every respect to those just mentioned, is to be provided, and employed within eighteen months of the commencement of the contract, and another within six years. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; all the steamers mentioned are able to do so. The refrigerating appliances are to be in accordance with the most modern patents, and six of the steamers must call at Hobart in the period between February and May of each year, subject to exemptions which the. Postmaster-General may allow. White labour is to be employed exclusively, and no discrimination is to be made between unionists and non-unionists. There is the usual provision for repurchase by the Government, and no steamship used for the service is to be chartered or sold without the consent of the Postmaster-General. In the event of any competing line of mail ships establishing an improved and accelerated service <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> the Suez Canal, the contractors shall, if so required at any time after the fifth year of the contract, provide a service equal to such improved service. Any additional subsidy and extended period of service are to be determined by mutual agreement, or settled by arbitration. Therefore, if unforeseen improvements, enabling, the rapidity of transit to be greatly increased, occur within the next five or six years we shall not be tied down to a slower service. All the steam-ships used under the contract, except any that may be temporarily employed, are to be fitted with a wireless telegraph apparatus when a shore station has been established in Australia. The plans and specifications of the new ships are to be submitted for approval within three months of the  ratification of the contract by Parliament, and the building of them is to be commenced within three months of the approval of the plans and specifications, and to proceed with all reasonable despatch. The contractors have, in accordance with the conditions of tender, made a deposit of  £10,000,  and will, in substitution for that already given, enter into a bond for  £50,000,  with approved securities, to be increased to £100,000 if sufficient progress is not made with the building of the steam-ships. It will be seen that the experience of the last contract has not been lost sight of. </para>

                        <para>- It might do so if the arrangement could be shown to be detrimental to the public of Australia. Speaking without having referred to the Act, I think it possible to prevent many arrangements seriously detrimental to the interest of the Commonwealth. Under a separate agreement the contractors undertake to continue the existing mail service on the present terms and conditions from February,  1908  - when the current contract expires - until the commencement of the proposed contract, in February,  1910,  unless an earlier date be agreed upon. They also agree to the insertion in this interim contract of the provision with respect to combines or commercial trusts. The mail ships employed under the principal contract are to fly the flag of the Commonwealth, provided that the Imperial Government consent - we hope that there will be no difficulty about that - and the contractor's position is not prejudiced thereby. </para>

                        <para>- The criticism of the honorable member for South Sydney with reference to the applicability of Commonwealth law, has been met, so far as present conditions are concerned, in a manner which I shall detail. In this matter, the Commonwealth Government, though deeply interested, is not so directly concerned as the States Governments, which have made various arrangements in regard to the export of butter. Nearly all our delay during the last week or two has been due to our desire to defer concluding the contract until the very active, vigilant, and capable Minister of Agriculture for Victoria could have an opportunity to place before the companies concerned the complaints which are being made throughout' Australia. A combination of shipping companies, has led to the imposition, by what are known as " the five lines," of penal charges on goods shipped by exporters who have not agreed to send all their butter by these lines. This has followed a reduction of the butter rate to1s.10d. per box for butter shipped by a rival combination known as the " three lines." However we may view these arrangements, they are regarded as honorably binding upon the parties to them, and it has been necessary to allow the representatives of the Orient Company time to communicate with the five lines, with a view to securing their freedom. When they had done this, the larger question was raised whether it would not be possible, not merely to provide for the Orient Company forsaking the agreement, but to induce the companies associated with it to reconsider the action they had taken under some pressure, and thus relieve the shippers of perishable produce of certain disabilities. That has been the cause of the delay, which I have been unable to explain to the House for obvious reasons. Negotiations had to be conducted, not only with a great number of steam-ship companies upon this side of the world, but also with their principals upon the other side of the globe. Considering the difficulties by which the whole question was surrounded, I have to freely admit that it has been owing to the unremitting attention and  energy which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swinburne</inline> has devoted to it that we have been enabled to arrive at what I believe will be a satisfactory conclusion. At all events, so far as the Orient Steam Navigation Company is concerned, they now propose an agreement which the people of Australia will recognise as a fair one, and they have been able to induce their companions in this agreement to take a similar course. The proposal made is to come into force at once, before the principal contract to which I have referred has any effect whatever, except, of course, so far as regards the building of ships and the carrying out of necessary preliminaries. At present, or up till lately, the freight charged for the carriage of butter by the mail steamers was 2s. 6d., and by the great carriers, which were not mail steamers, 2s. 3d., per box. </para>

                        <para>- The five lines are willing to come into it. These rates are to operate at any port of the Commonwealth. It is worth noting - to prevent any misconception - that the conditions for which we have been fighting, while we have been assisted so materially by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swinburne,</inline> are not for the benefit of one State, but apply to all the States, without any distinction whatever. The condition upon which these concessions are proposed, so far as the five lines are concerned, is that the shippers shall not use any line charging less than 2s. per box. Now, the present cutting rate charged by the three lines to which I have referred is1s.10d. per box, and it is intended to propose to them that they shall come into this agreement, and thus be placed absolutely on the same footing as the five lines. Then, instead of there being three lines and five lines charging different rates, there will be eight regular lines of steamers charging the same price from all ports of the Commonwealth. The producer will thus be able to send forward his butter without regard to the ship that is in port, knowing precisely the rate that he will be charged for its carriage and the facilities that he will enjoy. If this arrangement can be carried out - and I am assured by experts that it is most reasonable, that the price charged is low, and that the conditions offered to trade by this means are better than have ever been enjoyed in Australia - it promises to give a very great impetus indeed to the whole of the Industries dependent upon cool storage. If the three lines should persist in standing by themselves, and should rely upon the difference of 2d. per box to tout for custom, of course a different state of things may prevail. But to us the important point is that, so far as the Orient Steam Navigation Company is concerned, this fair and reasonable offer - which has been approved by all the experts to whom it has been submitted - is made by them. They are anxious - and they have proved their <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> - to withdraw from charging a penal rate, and to substitute instead a far superior arrangement from every Australian point of view. </para>

                        <para>- The question of the freight upon fruit has not arisen, because, as I understand, the present contest between the five lines and the three lines relates to butter. Moreover, our arrangement with regard to fruit will begin only with the commencement of the new contract. If the statement which I have made has not been quite as clear and comprehensive as I desired it to be, honorable members will realize that it is because the final papers relating to this matter have only been placed in my hands within the last few moments. I do not think, however, that anything material has been omitted. When honorable members look at the new contract, which I now lay upon the table of the House, they will find that it has been thoroughly revised in every part, and that it has been brought up to date in the light of our past experience. We are under a great obligation to the Secretary of. the Postmaster-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scott,</inline> and to the Crown Solicitor, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Powers,</inline> for the manner in which they have devoted themselves to the entire reconsideration of every line of this agreement, which I can therefore lay upon the table with the utmost confidence. It has been subjected to the strictest scrutiny from the point of view of the Post Office, from the freight point of view, and also by the Crown Solicitor. I desire to give notice that on Wednesday next- </para>

                        <para>- Yes; we took into account the three lowest tenders. On examination one appeared to be of a speculative character, and, therefore, we concentrated our attention on the other two. The second tender, of an advantageous character, was from a company which preferred to take only one-half of the service ; that is to say, they desired to undertake a monthly service to Australia, leaving some other company to share the work, so that we should have had three mail lines instead of two. That, at first sight, presented considerable attractions; but on inquiry it seemed very doubtful, from what we could learn, whether we could obtain from two lines the special conditions which are given in the contract now before honorable members. One difficulty was that the principal office of the second company was on the other side of the world. Honorable members will recollect that under the contract we undertake not to mention names except in the case of the lowest tender, though we may give" particulars of the other tenders. </para>

                        <para>- Speaking from memory, the amount of the first tender was £180,000 a year, without any of the special conditions contained in the Orient Company's tender. That offer was afterwards . lowered, if I recollect, to . £170,000, still without any special conditions; and only within the last few days there has been an intimation that a less amount might be considered. But under the circumstances, the fullest examination seemed to show that the contract with an old and tried service was the one that promised most advantages; the terms we have obtained are at least as favorable - indeed, so far as we could judge, more favorable - than those to be secured from any other tenderer. </para>

                        <para>- Under this contract we have a great gain by getting a truly Federal service, which touches every principal port during the year - that is, the vessels will call  six times at Tasmania, and every fortnight at each of the other ports. These new conditions will give, shippers, and the public of Australia generally, a deeper interest in the mail service than they have ever had before. We have been met in the frankest possible manner by the Messrs. Anderson, who were charged with the negotiations. Naturally those gentlemen have studied their own interests, and there were many weeks of keen bargaining before we were able to obtain the conditions now laid before honorable members. Those conditions speak for themselves ; but I may say those concessions have been made by Messrs. Anderson, on behalf of their company, in the hope that they will lead to the recognition of the fact that they are endeavouring, as far as possible, to provide a truly Australian service in order to meet Australian conditions, and that they are relying upon the Australian public for support by way of recognising that aim. </para>

                        <para>- I think the best course would be for the Prime Minister to move that the papers be printed, so as to afford an opportunity to honorable members to offer any remarks they please. If, later on, the Prime Minister desires to give notice of motion out of due time, he may. by permission, do so, but the notice of motion could, of course, be given on Tuesday. </para>

                    <para>.- I have listened with deep interest to the statement the Prime Minister has made ; and the contract submitted is evidently the result of very arduous negotiations. There was, however, in the midst of the honorable gentleman's eloquent exposition a melancholy sort of echo. The honorable member laid a much more dazzling prospect before us two years ago. </para>

                        <para>- Can we forget it? Only the densest party spirit could lead any one to forget it. The Government have not even got the £25,000. Are they going to forget that? One of the most extraordinary announcements was made by the Prime Minister to-day in reference to the miserable fiasco of the late tender. It is disgraceful to the Federal Government that two  years  after this frightful piece of imposition - after this gambling with the people <inline font-style="italic">of</inline> Australia, as it really was - we should be told, as we were this morning, that no process has been begun in the Courts of England to recover on the bond, which was sup posed to be so drawn up as to be recoverable in the most summary way. </para>

                        <para>- In that I agree, but the tender was accepted, I think, more than ten months ago. One of the advantages of a properly drawn-up bond is that the moment default occurs, it has  simply  to be put in suit to be enforced without delay. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know whether honorable members are satisfied to have this £25,000 suspended between heaven and earth for an indefinite period. I do not think that it is the disposition of honorable members. I admit that a seat on the other side of the House might lead honorable members to forget the whole affair; but our duty to the public ought to prevent that. Occasionally, when actions are begun, there are de' ays beyond the power of the parties ; but what I complain of is that no proceeding has been taken for- the recovery of the £25,000 . under the bond. Having regard to our very unfortunate experience in connexion with the old contract, which very nearly, involved the States in a most miserable ever-to-be-regretted dispute, I am pleased that the Government have been  able to conclude a contract with a company of a very different character. Over twenty years ago, I had the pleasure of playing a somewhat influential part in securing for the Orient Steam Navigation Company the prestige of a Royal mail service. In 1883, they entered into the Australian trade in competition with that mammoth concern, the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, and I think that the people of Australia should have a very kindly feeling towards them, having regard to the great battle which they fought against so formidable a rival. </para>

                        <para>- They so cheerfully observed the Australian view of that matter that I look with far more pleasure upon a contract entered into with them than I should have looked upon a contract made with any other company. I feel sure that in all our transactions with them we shall not have any of the miserable troubles that we experienced in connexion with the old abortive contract. In view of the fact that the Prime Minister has, in many eloquent speeches, expressed an ardent desire to encourage the flow of immigration to Australia, I notice with some regret that the honorable member made no mention of any arrangement in relation to that very important subject. </para>

                        <para>- That will be a matter for the consideration of the House when we are asked to deal with this contract. I listened with the greatest pleasure to the details given by the Prime Minister as to one or two features of the contract. In the first place, I think that the least we could do for Queensland is that which the Government have done in connexion with this contract. And so with Tasmania. We might fairly relieve Queensland at once of the extra payment which she has been making. I fail to see why we should wait for another two years before doing so, because, by the terms of this contract, we practically acknowledge that we should have relieved her of this obligation. I shall be very glad to support any movement to relieve the people of Queensland, from the present time until the new contract begins, of the special payment which they are now making to the company. I do not wish at this stage to deal with the questions of rates and freights. There are matters in connexion with the contract which require serious attention, but, subject to a fuller consideration of all its details, I wish to say that it affords me the greatest possible pleasure to know that this contract - if it prove a wise and good one - has been made with a company on whose promises and undertakings we can fully rely. </para>

                    <para>.- The statement that Queensland is satisfied, Tasmania is satisfied, and the primary producers are satisfied with the terms of this contract, sounds very well. The contract provides for something more than a postal service, consideration having been given to certain vested interests. About a fortnight ago I asked the Prime Minister to consider the advisableness of providing in the contract that the vessels of the service should be docked in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- It is all very well for the Prime Minister to say "Hear, hear," but whilst I believe that there is an understanding that the vessels of the fleet as far as possible shall be docked in Australia, a provision to that effect has not been inserted in the contract. The mere fact that these vessels will fly the Australian flag is not in itself sufficient to satisfy the people of Australia. Had the postal service alone been considered I should not have been justified in urging that provision should be made for the docking of the steamers of the fleet in Australia; but since the contract provides for something more than a postal service - since it covers various vested interests - I have a perfect right to put in a plea for the consideration of other vested interests. The subsidy of £170,000 per annum means that the people of Australia will have to pay nearly  £500  per day for this service. About four years, ago, when the Reid-McLean Administration concluded a contract with the Orient Steam ' Navigation Company for a service at the rate of  £120,000  per annum, it was subjected to considerable criticism by many honorable members, as well as by a section of the press. We now have before us a contract under which the annual payments are increased by  £50,000,  and the fact that the Australian flag is to be flown over the stern of these vessels will not prevent the people from making the arithmetical calculation that an annual payment of  £170,000  represents  5  percent, on a capital of  £3,400,000.  I can understand the honorable member for Barrier saying in the circumstances that if we are to impose one or two more conditions we might as well have a fleet of our own. The arrangement is not such an excellent one. as it would at first sight appear. Seven or eight vessels of the type for which provision is made could readily be purchased for  £3,400,000.  Hundreds of thousands of people in Australia will derive no benefit from a speedy mail service, and I think that I was quite justified in asking the Prime Minister in arranging the contract to do something for the dockers, who are amongst the most ill-paid of our workers. I hope that, although there is no such provision in the contract itself, there will be a distinct understanding between the Government and the company that, whenever practicable, these mail steamers will be docked in Australia. From a sentimental point of view I am pleased that the Orient Steam Navigation Company, which is a well-tried one, is the successful tenderer, and in conclusion' would emphasize the point made by the leader of the Opposition as to the bond. I hope that it will not be so full of loopholes as was that prepared by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Croker</inline> in connexion with the recent abortive contract. </para>

                    <para>.- I ask the Prime Minister to postpone the further consideration of this matter until Thursday next, so that honorable members, many of whom leave for Adelaide and Sydney to-day, and will be unable to read the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report of his speech until Tuesday next, may fully inform themselves on the subject. The proposal to hand our mail service over to a private company for a term of ten years is an exceedingly important one, and requires very careful consideration. The Prime Minister gave us a great deal of information, but he ad- mitred that the papers from which he spoke came into his hands only five minutes before his speech was delivered, and therefore his remarks may not have been as comprehensive as they would have been, had he had more time for preparation. A good deal of additional information was elicited by questions, and I think that honorable members should have an opportunity of making themselves fully acquainted with all the facts, so far as they are now published. If we debate the matter on Thursday next, we shall probably be able to come to a decision before the end of the week, and the Senate can deal with the matter at the beginning of the following week. I hope that the House will not ratify the agreement, but will take the better and bolder course of deciding to inaugurate a Commonwealth service. I hold that two years ago the House failed to do its duty in this matter. Those who then advocated the running of a Commonwealth mail service were undoubtedly right, as events have clearly shown. The right honorable member for East Sydney has pointed out what a miserable fiasco the adoption of the alternative course was. </para>

                    <para>. - I indorse many of the remarks of the leader of the Opposition. I am pleased that it is the Orient Steam Navigation Company which has made this contract with the Government. If the Prime Minister can see his way to postpone the consideration of the matter for a day or two, that course may conduce to a quicker settlement of it; but, in any case, he can be sure of my vote and support. I have watched the operations of the Orient Steam Navigation Company for the last fifteen years; but I did' not know that it was the leader of the Opposition who helped it to start here. We owe to the Orient Steam Navigation Company, rather than to the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, the acceleration of transit and other advantages which we now enjoy. The company has employed British men on British ships, and has made a brave fight against a competitor which has been so unscrupulous that the  President  of the Board of Trade has said that the time may come when it will have to  be prosecuted criminally for its wicked and cruel treatment of the lascars in its employ. The Orient Steam Navigation Company, by employing white seamen, has hurled back the insulting charge made against Britishers  by the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, that they are too drunken to be employed. </para>

                        <para>- It has said so repeatedly, and acts speak more loudly than words. The Orient Steam Navigation Company has never had the finger of scorn pointed at it for carrying German goods imported to England, and transhipped at London for Australia, for 100 per cent, less than the rates at which it carried British goods from London to Australia. Therefore I am glad that the Orient Steam Navigation Company is to have the contract, even if it be for ten years. The honorable member for Barrier knows that he can always command my vote for the establishment of a Commonwealth mail service. If the Orient Steam Navigation Company flies the Australian flag, that may be the thin end of the wedge, and we may ultimately be able to start a fortnightly service with boats of our own, to be used as cruisers in time of war, and in time of peace carrying mails as far as Ceylon. I think that a fortnightly service would be sufficient for quick despatch, in addition to communication with Europe by way of the Cape; but if more vessels are needed, I am sure that the shipping companies will supply them. I am very pleased with the contract, as I have gathered its terms from the eloquent lips of the Prime Minister. It is the fairest and best ever entered into by Australia. By requiring a bond of £100,000 we shall prevent trickery such as we have experienced in the past. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone,</inline> on one occasion, when asked by Lord Tollemache if he thought that the shipping companies would assist Germany to land troops in England, said that he believed that they would carry troops to Hell if they could get filthy lucre for doing so. The Orient Steam Navigation Company, however, is free from reproach. </para>

That sum is paid for benefits quite separate and apart from a mail service, and makes the total subsidy paid by Australia £146,000. </para>

                    - No; under this agreement, if the Queensland Government refused to pay, the boats would cease to go to Brisbane until 1910. At present a subsidy of £120,000 is being paid by the Commonwealth Government, and £26,000 by the Queensland Government, a portion of which - between £4,000 and . £5,000 - is refunded by the Commonwealth to Queensland. A total subsidy of £146,000 is being paid at present for a combined mail and mercantile service. That sum is very much less than the proposed subsidy of £170,000 provided for under the new contract to be paid from and after 1910 ; but it is, perhaps, quite as much as should be paid for the less advantageous service which will cease in the year named. In the meantime, it does seem to me the Commonwealth should forthwith relieve Queensland of the payment of this immense burden of £26,000 a year. That is the only comment I have to offer upon the proposal now made save in terms of praise. However, that is, after all, a matter which is entirely outside the mail contract, and which could be arranged between the Commonwealth Government and the Government of Queensland. Save as to that, I think the Government are. to be heartily congratulated upon the contract that has been made.

The people of the Commonwealth, and particularly the trading community, who have been very much disturbed by the uncertainty which has existed for some time in connexion with this matter, and particularly during the long period occupied by the proceedings connected with the recent fiasco, will be very much gratified at what has taken place. I hope that this agreement with a company to which the people of the Commonwealth already owe so much will be satisfactorily completed. I trust that the amount at present due by the late mail contractors will be obtained without delay, and that that nightmare will be done with and forgotten. I am glad that the Victorian Minister of Agriculture has received the commendation he deserves from the Prime Minister for the work he has done in bringing the various States Governments into line in this matter. On behalf of the commercial institutions, I express the most complete satisfaction at the accomplishment of a contract which, I trust, will be for the permanent good of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not intend to go into the merits of the proposed contract at this stage, but I wish to emphasize the protest made by the honorable member for Brisbane against the contract on the ground that it would compel Queensland, for the next two years at all events, to continue the payment of a subsidy of £26,000 - less about £5,000 refunded by the Commonwealth. It appears to me that, as all the other States will benefit under the contract in being able at once to arrange for the export of perishable produce it is hardly fair that Queens- land should be left out, even for the two years referred to. I do not intend to say any more on the subject now. It is well known that I favour the Commonwealth running its own line of steamers. When we take into consideration the elaborate statement made by the Prime Minister today, and the varied conditions he has sought to bring about, it is not unreasonable to say that he had only to go a little further to decide upon running a line of Commonwealth steamers, which, I am satisfied, would be found more satisfactory in the long run. </para>

The honorable member for Barrier, and those who think with him, are certainly entitled to every opportunity to consider and criticise this contract. In order that such an opportunity may be afforded, while I propose to put this matter down for consideration on Wednesday next, I shall have pleasure in arranging for <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> proofs of this afternoon's proceedings to be sent to every member of the House by to-morrow's post, in order that they may have a full opportunity of considering the provisions of the contract before it is dealt with on Wednesday next. We have other business set down for Tuesday, which may possibly overflow into Wednesday. </para>
