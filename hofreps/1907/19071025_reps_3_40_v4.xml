                        <para>- The preparation of the Bill, which must be read in relation to the Tariff, is well in hand. The discussions now taking place on the schedule touch so many points of the new protection that we are anxious to take advantage of them before introducing a measure, the scope of which will be extensive and its administration complex. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to ask the Prime Minister, without notice, a question relating to the Commonwealth offices in London. It is mentioned in this morning&#39;s newspapers that an offer made by the Government for a lease of the site of the proposed Commonwealth offices is likely to be rejected, and that it is possible that the Government may offer an increased rental. Are the Ministry satisfied that a considerable amount of the work now done by the Agents-General of the States is likely to be transferred to the Commonwealth, having regard to the statement made in the report of the Agents-General, presented in December,  1905,  to the effect that of a total outlay of &#163;82,000 in connexion with their offices, &#163;51,000 or  &#163;52,000  represented expenditure incurred in connexion with the registration or inscription of stock, which of course is not likely to be transferred to the High Commissioner ? Seeing that if a High Commissioner were appointed as a merely ornamental entertainer he would be Ludicrously out of place, is there any certainty that the greater part of the expenditure now defrayed by the States will be taken over by the Commonwealth as their agent in order to justify to some extent the large expenditure proposed to be incurred upon Commonwealth offices? . </para>

                        <para>- It is rather difficult to deal off-hand with all the suggestions contained in the honorable member&#39;s inquiry. He, perhaps, will remember that, since the presentation of the report to which he refers, there has been in connexion with the London offices of several of the States a very large development of business quite apart from the inscription of stock. That business must continue to grow and thus involve an increased expenditure upon the part of the States.</para>

                            <para>- Are negotiations pending between the States and the Commonwealth, which are likely to be successful, in regard to the transfer to the Commonwealth control of any portion of the London business of the States, including the management of the States debts, as to the transfer of which the Agents-General in the report I have mentioned expressed considerable doubt? I think the House should receive some information on the point in view of the very large expenditure which is likely to be incurred in connexion with the selection of a site for offices. </para>

                            <para>- The information sought will be immediately pertinent when there is before the House a proposal for the acquisition of the site. It can then be dealt with in detail. The assurances I have received from the States are practically those made by several States Premiers at recent Conferences. They were willing to transfer to the Commonwealth certain portions of the work now being carried out by the Agents-General. I do not recall that in any case there was a proposal to transfer to the Commonwealth the management of any States debts whilst they remain States debts. When the States debts become Commonwealth debts then naturally the Commonwealth alone will deal with them. </para>

                    <para>- I wish to make a personal explanation in reference to a statement in this morning&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> which has just been brought under my notice. It is reported in that newspaper that last night I made some observations to the honorable member for Maranoa, who, in. reply, threatened to do for me outside the chamber. It is too bad for a newspaper to attribute ton honorable member, for the purpose of holding him up to ridicule, statements which he never even thought of making. I made no Statement to the&#39; honorable member for Maranoa of the kind attributed to me by the <inline font-style="italic">Age.</inline></para>

                        <para>.- I feel that it is due to the Tariff Commission, that at least one member of it should make some observations upon this item, in respect of which some honorable members appear to be labouring under a misapprehension.. I listened with a good deal of interest to the speech which was delivered last evening by the honorable member for Yarra, who put the case for the manufacturers very well indeed. It seems to me, however, that his speech afforded another excellent illustration of the vicious circle in which protectionists move. He pointed out that it was absolutely necessary to levy high protective duties upon confectionery, because similar duties had been imposed for the benefit of other industries.  His  statement clearly illustrates what is continually going on in the fiscal circle. One industry has to bear a portion of the burden which rightly belongs to another. </para>

The honorable member for Yarra stated last evening that a reduction had taken place in the price of sweetmeats in Victoria, and quoted evidence in support of his allegation.  His  statement was entirely correct, but I object to his having left the &#34;tail&#34; of the thing out of sight. According to the evidence of a witness, who appeared before the Tariff Commission, the reduction in the price of confectionery was made by a certain firm for the purpose of crushing a workman who had started a business of his own in opposition to them, and was endeavouring to work up a connexion for himself. That was the reason why the reduction was made, and I am sure that it is one which will not &#39;commend itself to the honorable member. Consequently, his illustration of the willingness of the manufacturers to reduce their prices was about the worst that he could have selected to support the contention that protective duties have the effect of reducing prices.

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. MacPherson</inline> Robertson, who has a substantial interest in one of the largest confectionery firms in Victoria, and whose business is conducted upon excellent principles. I regret that other manufacturers do not conform to the high standard upon which he carries on his important industry. The importing firms tendered no evidence whatever to the Tariff Commission. Had they been in such close combination as has been suggested by the honorable member for Yarra, they would undoubtedly &#34;have appeared before that body. But I believe that they did not tender evidence because of the keen  competition which exists amongst themselves. The fact that no importer appeared before the Commission to my mind demonstrates that no such combination as has been alleged exists. There is no doubt that during recent years the imports of confectionery have considerably increased. But I would point out that those imports chiefly consist of chocolate combinations, which seem to be so popular with the users of confectionery in this country. </para>

                            <para>- The increase of 500,000 lbs. in, general confectionery is not a very serious one. In relation to the local manufacture it is really a negligible quantity. The witnesses who. appeared before the Tariff Commission testified that the local manufacturers enjoy a practical monopoly of the lower class of the confectionery trade. As a matter of fact, there are very few importations of confectionery other than chocolate preparations. In this particular instance it can scarcely be alleged that our manufacturers have to compete against that pauperized labour which forms such a useful <inline font-style="italic">ad captandum</inline> argument amongst &#39; the protectionists &#39; of Australia. The imports of confectionery are nearly all comprised in three very large British, firms, all of whom treat their employes in a way that is. almost unexampled. They are. firms of the highest repute, and their attitude towards their employes is a standing refutation of the allegation that highly paid labour must always be protected against poorly paid labour. These firms are paying double the wages which are paid in other parts of the world, and are  treating their employes in the most handsome fashion, notwithstanding that they control the entire importation of confectionery into the Commonwealth. What has become of the cheaply paid labour in this industry in Great Britain? Why do not the confectionery manufacturers who employ cheap labour sweep out of existence the workmen employed by Cadbury&#39;s, Fry&#39;s, and Rowntree&#39;s? The truth is - as has been pointed &#39;out again and again by political economists - that highly paid workmen do not require protection against poorly paid labour, because, of the two, the latter is the most ineffective. The honorable member for Yarra, recognising that the reputation of. such firms as Cadbury&#39;s was beyond assault, took refuge in the insinuation that certain Scottish firms sweated their employes, and that large quantities of their confectionery were imported into the Commonwealth. Fortunately, these firms have representatives here, and one of those representatives who heard the insinuation in regard to the bad conditions imposed upon the operatives, immediately took action to refute it. lt is to be regretted that an honorable member will utter words which are put into his mouth by interested people, without first taking the trouble to satisfy himself as to their accuracy. </para>

                            <para>- They compete very successfully indeed. I hold in  my hand a copy of two telegrams sent by a representative of one of these Scottish importing firms to his firm in Glasgow asking them to telegraph immediately what is the average wage paid to their workmen. The following is the reply received, adding necessary words to make it intelligible: - </para>

                    <para>Above the age of eighteen, the average wage is 32s. weekly. </para>
                    <para class="block">The honorable member for Yarra is sufficiently well acquainted with the labour conditions in the old country to know that such is by no means a sweating wage, but that, as a matter of fact, taking the difference in the cost of living as between the two countries, it compares favorably with the average paid in Australia. </para>
                    <para class="block">At any rate, here is proof positive that one of the Scotch firms, regarding whom insinuations were made, pay what is, so far as the old country is concerned, a high wage. The principal witness before the Commission on this subject was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robertson. His</inline> evidence was undoubtedly  given frankly, and with the object of supplying all reasonable information; and he did not for a <inline font-style="italic">moment</inline> insinuate that he had to compete with sweated labour in connexion with importations. He stated what I believe is the fact, that, so far as the higher classes of confectionery are concerned - and these form the bulk of the importations - high wages are paid, not only in Great Britain, but even on the continent of Europe. Some of the men employed on the continent earn as much as &#163;3 or a week; but these are special cases, and that rate does not apply to the majority. Here, at any rate, we have an Australian industry which has to face a certain amount of competition, not from poorly paid labour, but from well paid labour. The honorable member for Yarra, while pointing out the increased importation of confectionery, had to admit that there has been a certain increase in local production, though he argued that the local increase is not proportionate to the importation. However, I think that if the honorable&#39; member for Yarra goes &#39;into the figures again, he will find that the increase in the local production is in greater ratio than the increase of importation. </para>

                    <para>That does not look very sad or discouraging in regard to the future of the confectionery industry of Australia. The manufacturers complained to the Commission that certain classes of chocolate were admitted at a lower rate than was justifiable. That complaint was regarded as reasonable, and, accordingly, the Tariff Commission recommended that edible chocolates, which are really confectionery, should be placed in the higher lists. That recommendation has been adopted by the Government, and will, in itself, be a considerable advantage to the local manufacturers&#39;, who have obtained a higher duty for a large and important class of chocolate goods. It will be observed by those who have taken the trouble to read the Commission&#39;s report, that the members were practically unanimous in this connexion. When it is remembered that the recommendations were based very largely on the evidence of the manufacturers themselves, it will be realized that the very best case was submitted for higher duties. There was little or no rebutting evidence; and, consequently, it may be fairly said that the case was judged on the evidence of the manufacturers themselves. It is unfortunate, I think, that that should be so ; but the Commission had to take such evidence as was offered them. I think I can fairly claim on behalf of both sections of the Commission that the duties they recommended were regarded as ample even from a protectionist stand-point. The free-trade section, in practically indorsing the recommendation of the protectionist section, were largely influenced by the fact that those particular confections might reasonably be subjected to a very high revenue duty. But I have not heard yet, in the whole course of the debate, any substantial reason given for the higher rate of duty as proposed by the Government. </para>

                            <para>- No; it seems to be simply a case of running up the duties, reason or no reason. While I undoubtedly hesitate to take any steps which would injure or destroy an industry that I regard as one particularly Australian - as one which ought to be carried on here, rather than that we should have any considerable introduction of confectionery from abroad - I think it is the duty of this Committee not to impose such a high Tariff as may lead to a monopoly in the trade. I have here a telegram from a manufacturing confectioner in Western Australia, who gave evidence before the Tariff Commission in that State ; and he is of opinion, now that he has been able to compare the Government proposal with the recommendation of the Tariff Commission, that the latter is the fairer all round. With such additional evidence as that before me, I have no hesitation whatever in adhering to the recommendation of the Commission. I feel satisfied that if that recommendation be adopted, the industry will continue to progress until those engaged in it have practically control of the whole of the trade, even including those chocolate goods of which there has been a considerable introduction during the last few years. That importation, however, has been more than equalled by the increase in local production, and that increase is a fair indication of the prosperity which has come to Australia during the last few years, and which I hope will be long continued. </para>

                        <para>. - This is an item in which I take some interest; and, so far as I can gather from the evidence obtainable, the market for the commoner classes of confectionery is practically controlled by local manufacturers. If the local men have complete control of the market, there seems no necessity for a duty on this class of goods. We have been told by a member of the freetrade section of the Tariff Commission that  practically the trade is in the hands, of Australians; and if a duty be placed on importations, the result, undoubtedly, will be to increase the cost of imported goods. We must remember that whatever duties we impose there must be some importation of all classes of goods; and the increase in price caused by the Tariff enables the  local  manufacturer, who has command of the trade, to increase his price .to the consumer. That is a natural result of a highly protective Tariff ; it ceases to be protective, and becomes taxation. The duty in itself will result in only a small amount of revenue, but, as a matter of fact, it is imposed on the whole consumption, though in regard to the latter we, of course, have no statistics. It seems to me that such a duty confers no benefit on the general consumer, though, of course, it is of great advantage to those engaged in the trade bv enablking them to obtain higher prices. Statistics go to show that their output has increased enormously, and that there has also been an increase in the number of .persons employed in the making of the various brands of confectionery. According to a return furnished to the Tariff Commission, the number of employes in the confectionery business in New South Wales in 1899 was 613,. and in 1904 839, while in  Victoria  the numbers were 727 and 995 respectively. Therefore, in this State, in five years the number of the employes in the&#39; business has increased by more than 250. . These facts show that the industry is by no means declining, and that it will not suffer if we do not increase the duty on confectionery. Last night the &#62; honorable member for Yarra stated that although the higher rates of duties are now being collected, prices have not been increased to the consumer, that the child who enters a lolly shop gets as much for his pence as he received formerly. But the retail sellers have to pay more for their supplies. The honorable member for Yarra spoke of this condition of things .as something in favour of the Trust; but I interjected that the small storekeepers were really being sweated, and I&#39; contend again now that, in supporting the  present arrangement, the honorable member is giving countenance to the sweat-&#39; ing of the labour engaged in the work of distribution, because, when &#39;goods are sold bv the ounce, those who sell them may well, be spoken of as labourers. The confectionery industry is well established in&#39; </para>

                    <para class="block">Australia, and is a. credit to the Common- &#39; wealth. Free-traders like to see up-to-date factories which are able to stand alone, and it is an eye-opener to go through some of the factories here.. The industry being so well established, it is absurd to speak of fostering or protecting it. Higher rates of duty are not. necessary for its protection, and, if agreed to, can only have the effect of taxing the community for the benefit of the manufacturers in the industry, who. have practically the command of the trade of the Commonwealth. Therefore, it is no longer a question of free-trade or protection. One of the witnesses examined before the Tariff Commission, said that, the importations of confectionery did not affect the local manufacturers, that the over-sea competition was not worth considering, the local trade being strong enough to stand on&#39; its own. According to him, it is the Australian competition that is affecting the local makers. They are cutting into one another&#39;s trade, and thus reducing their profits. It is not the duty of Parliament to interfere under these circumstances. Competition is the soul of business, and firms that are not up-to-date and able to compete with, &#39;their rivals must go under. Prior to the passing, of the Kingston Tariff, there were in New South Wales manufactures which had not been fostered by hot-house treatment, but established under free-trade, and when, on the consummation of Federation, were able to compete on equal terms in the Victorian market, the Victorian manufacturers had speedily to get rid of the obsolete machinery with- which they had been making a good living under the old Victorian Tariff. Of course, the man in the street is always ready to give information on this or any other subject ; but a witness who is under examination on oath, and liable to punishment for giving false testimony, is much more careful. Therefore the statements contained in the evidence attached to the reports of the Tariff Commission must be taken in preference to irresponsible statements. Some of the witnesses who asked for higher rates of duty had commenced business only since the imposition of the Kingston Tariff, and&#39;, notwithstanding, were doing very well. They thought, however, that if the importation of confectionery were reduced, they would get a larger output. But, as I have shown, it is the local competition that does most to reduce prices, and men who have been in business for only a short time </para>

If the small makers are earning a good living,wemay be sure that the large manufacture . are amassing wealth. It is highly creditable to the industry that wages have increased; that the employers who are doing well themselves are paying good wages to their workmen. Of course, they expect high-class work from them. In some of the factories in Melbourne, artists are employed in the manufacture of confectionery, and, of course, must be paid high wages. Employment is given to large numbers of active, well-dressed, respectable girls, who are well paid. This being the state of the industry under the old duties, why should we increase the rate, seeing that the effect of such action &#39;can be only to increase prices or to sweat the retailers.? .

                            <para>- Most of the confectionery imported consists of high-class chocolate manufactures and preserved fruits, which are most delicious, and are got up most attractively, largely by French firms. This is confectionery which you can put on your table without the fear of causing dyspepsia to your guests, and we should take steps to make it reasonably cheap, and within the reach of all classes. Notwithstanding the importation of high-class confectionery from abroad, the trade of the local manufacturers is increasing largely, and I understand that nowhere in Australia is better confectionery made than in Victoria. Under these circumstances, theCommittee will be well advised if it adopts the suggestions of the Tariff Commission. I I find that in respect to some of these items both sections agreed that certain duties be imposed, and -I fail to understand why the Minister should have taken the extreme course of imposing duties, 50 per cent., and, in some cases,100per cent. , in excess of the increases recommended even by the protectionist section of the Commission. The confectioners of this State, who appeared before the Commission, showed that they were able to thrive under the Victorian Tariff, and the Commission, recognising that a considerable sum had been invested in the industry arid that it was worth preserving, after a careful consideration of evidence put before it by trade experts, made certain recommendations, the adoption of which by the Parliament would it believed do justice to the industry. Surely those recommendations ought to have some weight with the Committee. The free-trade and protectionist sections of the Commission agreed that on the ordinary class of cheap confectionery in respect of which there is no competition worth mentioning a duty of 2d. per lb. should be imposed. The Government, however, have proposed a duty of 3¾ d. per lb.On ornamental confectionery the &#39;Government pro pose a duty of 25 per cent., whilst the protectionist section of the Commission recommend a duty of 2d. per lb. On cocoa and chocolate the Government propose a duty of 2&#188;d. per lb. ; the free-trade section of the Commission recommended that a duty of1d. per lb. should be imposed, whilst the protectionist section recommended a duty of 2d. perlb. Both sections of the Commission recommended  that  cocoa beans should be free, and  that  recommendation has been adopted. But on cocoa shells and nibs a duty  of¾d. per1b has been imposed, although the Commission agreed that they should be free. Cocoa butter, caramel, caramel paste, and caramel butter have been made dutiable at1¾d., whereas the Commission recommended a dutyof1d per lb. The outlook for the industry seems to be good, and the Minister shows a want of respect for the Committee in submitting these increased &#39;duties without offering any explanation in regard to them. As to the existence of a combine, to which reference has been made, I consider that that is a question which should be dealt with when the amending Anti-Trust Bill is before us, and that to deal with it now would be only to confuse the issue. Will the Minister now give some reason for imposing duties much higher than those recommended even by the protectionist section of the Commission. </para>

                            <para>- Whilst I do not say for a moment that the old duty was  entirely  satisfactory I certainly think that the proposal made by the Government is still more, unsatisfactory. I take it that the argument for the imposition of protective duties generally is that they -give&#39; our own people an opportunity to compete under more favourable conditions than would otherwise prevail. Two phases of this question have to be considered in this connexion ; one is the conditions under which men engaged, say, in the chocolate manufactories of Great Britain and elsewhere work, and the other the conditions under which the industry is carried on here. Whilst I shall not say that &#39; the rate of wages paid in Great Britain is as good as that prevailing here, I do say that the conditions under which men and women are engaged in chocolate factories there are on the whole as good as those prevailing here or elsewhere. It has been asserted that there is in this State a combine comprising practically the whole of those engaged in the manufacture of confectionery. That, however, does not affect in the slightest degree my. judgment in this case. A number of honorable members are inclined to allow their decision to be influenced by the statement that there is a trust in existence, .but I am disposed to agree with the honorable member for Robertson that that is&#39; a matter which cannot properly be considered in connexion with this item. Nor do I think that it is a matter with which those who believe in individualism should concern themselves, because they favour conditions which render the creation of trusts and combines inevitable. Yet, when these combinations arise, they propose to exercise remedies which are not only drastic, but which, in some cases, are grossly unjust. What I propose in regard to trusts is what I should propose in regard to individuals. Both are entitled to absolute fair play. The mere fact that a combine regulates the conditions attached to an industry ought not to prevent justice being meted out to it. A combine <inline font-style="italic">qua</inline> combine ought not to be .treated differently from an ordinary individual carrying on his business. But the mere fact that a number of persons are driven together by the inexorable consequences of a competition ruthless in its results, and in its methods, is sufficient to induce a number of honorable members to promulgate all sorts of schemes for dealing with them. After all our chief consideration should be the consumer, who certainly seems to have been overlooked in this matter. I say that the persons who eat chocolates - and their name is legion - have not received their fair share of attention. Personally, I think that the consumption of boiled lollies, chocolates, and, indeed, of sugar in any form, is very healthy. </para>

I am sufficiently ignorant of the ingredients of sweetmeats to pin my faith to. pure sugar with such an admixture of colouring matter as will render it pleasant to the eye, and harmless to the stomach. The preference which it is proposed to grant to such firms as Fry&#39;s, Rowntree&#39;s, and Cadbury&#39;s - a preference of only <inline font-style="italic">\A.</inline> per- lb. - is simply absurd. It does &#34; not appeal to me either as a representative of the people or as the father of .children who consume a good deal of chocolate.

These rates of duty would constitute a fair compromise, and would allow the manufacturers of the United Kingdom a reasonable preference. The increase which has taken place in the importations of confectionery during the past few years is due to the increased spending power of the people, which, during that period, has been very marked. Not only did the largest manufacturer of confectionery in New South Wales not ask for the present high duty, but he actually wrote to the Minister of Trade and Customs before the Tariff was &#39;introduced, suggesting that no higher rate than 2d. per lb. should be imposed. Consequently, I suggest that a duty of 2&#189;d. per lb. under the general Tariff would represent an appropriate adjustment of the rate.

                        <para>.- My own feeling is that a case has not been made out for the extreme duty proposed by the Government. It is quite clear from the evidence tendered to the Tariff Commission that the large manufacturers engaged in the confectionery industry are doing very well. An analysis of the cost of production - particularly in connexion with sugar - justifies the belief that the honorable member for West Sydney has suggested a fair compromise. </para>

                            <para>- If we cannot accept the statements made by the Treasurer we have arrived at a very pretty pass indeed. I had a suspicion that there was an element of bargaining in the treatment accorded to one or two items of the Tariff, and that a high duty had been proposed in respect of them under the belief that the Committee would reduce it. If the Treasurer has made any declaration of the character attributed to him by the honorable member for Paramatta, the sooner the public learn how he is leading the Committee in this matter the better. </para>

                        <para>. - The statement of the honorable member for Parramatta is not correct ; he is quoting from a newspaper that never tells the truth. One part of the report of the interview is fairly correct, but the latter part is absolutely untrue. </para>

As a matter of fact, I was asked a question by a representative of the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> about the reduction in the duty on candles, and I said to him that if there were no other items reduced in larger proportion, as the consideration of the Tariff went on, I should not have very much to complain of. </para>

                            <para>- That is not so. I have said, from the first submission of the Tariff, that alterations must take place - that suggestions were sure to be made that could not be made before the public knew what the Tariff proposals were. I anticipated that some very good information might be given, and suggestions made, to the Government, whereby anomalies would be removed ; and that is what I referred to in the newspaper interview. If, from persons outside, or from honorable members, there should come any reliable information pointing to the necessity for making alterations, I shall take notice of it and will adopt the consequent suggestions if they appeal to me. Not one word that I ever gave to any newspaper interviewer can be interpreted as meaning that I proposed the duties set forth in the Tariff with a view to their being reduced. </para>

But what has happened here this morning is that the Treasurer has made a statement repudiating; what I read from the report of a newspaper interview, and has, in the next breath, repeated the statements contained! in that interview. That is the position. </para>

I shall allow neither the honorable member for Parramatta nor any one else to create a false impression in that way. I have just stated that I shall generally stand by the duties as proposed, but, at the same time, I cannot expect to carry the whole of them. I think I can say that, up to the present, I have not done badly in submitting a fairly acceptable Tariff.

If I were to talk in the most convincing way for an hour or two, I should only give rise to a flood of debate on the part of those who are never satisfied with anything. Under; the circumstances, I control myself, and say no more than I can possibly avoid ; a Minister who desires expedition must not speak too often or too long. While I am on my feet, however, I wish to urge upon honorable members that the existence of a combine has nothing whatever to do with the Government proposal. I may say that I have information which leads me to suppose that there is a combine; and I think I am at liberty to go 61 so far as to say that the matter has been inquired into by the Crown Law Officers, who have some very important information, on which action is likely to be taken. I am not prepared to say more at present because the case may be regarded as <inline font-style="italic">sub judice.</inline> At present, I contend that the proposed duty ought not to be imperilled because there happens to be a combine. </para>

                            <para>- That is a repe&#34;tition of an untruth. It has been contended that the .Government proposal means a large increase of the duty. I take it that before Federation the States may be taken to have known something of their own business in regard to fiscal matters. I have here figures which show that before Federation the duty on confectionery in New South Wales - owing to the same influence which is felt on the benches opposite - was only 1d. per lb. </para>

                            <para>- Flourishing? In Victoria, prior to Federation, the duty was 2d. per lb., or 25 per cent. ; in Queensland, 4-d. per lb. ; in South Australia, 3d. per lb. ; in Tasmania, 2d per lb. ; and in Western Australia, 4d per lb. In Canada, at the same period, the duty was &#163;d. per lb., and 35 per cent., which worked out at an average of 3jd. per lb. This information has just been handed to me by the Comptroller-General. The duty that was first proposed on this particular item in 1.002 for the Commonwealth,, was 2d. per lb., and 15 per cent. ; but that was reduced to id. The duty, which was fixed in 1902, on cocoa and chocolate, was id. per lb., and on other confectionery 2d., with 20 per cent, on ornamental confectionery and so forth - the duties varied. The Government proposal now practically strikes an average of the duties imposed by the States prior to Federation; and one reason which causes me to submit the proposed duty is that, for some three or four years, importations, instead of decreasing, have been increasing. </para>

                            <para>- There is no attempt at proof; only the bald statement is made. Last year, the importations of confectionery amounted to 3,184,000 lbs., of a value of .&#163;116,000. In 1903 the value of the imports was &#163;89,000 odd, so that there has been an increase of about  5220 <inline font-style="italic">Tariff</inline> &#91;REPRESENTATIVES.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">(Confectionery, &#38;c).</inline> &#163;30,000. That cannot be good for the industry in Australia. I am just as opposed as any one to undue combination, but the fact that there is a combine should not dissuade honorable members from imposing a fair and proper duty. I should, perhaps, have liked to see a little more preference given to Great Britain, whence come about two- thirds of the importations, the remainder being from the United States, Spain, Italy, Germany, France, Hong Kong, and other foreign countries. For the reasons that I have stated, I do not wish to dwell on this subject, but I have given shortly the grounds on which the Government have proposed to increase the rates, which, undoubtedly, were too greatly reduced by the Tariff of 1902. I wish to see the making of confectionery in Australia increase; we should not import any. If there is a nettle in the shape of a combine, we should grasp it. firmly. I feel strongly about combines, and have been urging certain action in connexion with this and with others. Something should be done, and when the Bill which is in the other House is passed, I think that pretty drastic action will be taken, which will show that we mean business. </para>

                            <para>- If the Minister cannot give us the information we ask for, he should at least set an example of courtesy. Ministers are the worst offenders, they are the most discourteous men in the Chamber. But they are mistaken if they think that they can bullock the Tariff through, and silence honorable members. I, for one, refuse to forego my right of speech under the influence of Ministerial threatenings or the boorish behaviour of Ministerial supporters, and intend to say what I have to say completely and without curtailment. The Tariff Commission unanimously recommended that the duty on confectionery should not exceed 2d., and yet the Government, without rhyme or reason, propose to make the rate 3¾d. The Treasurer has not said a word in justification of the proposal. </para>

                            <para>- If there is one item in the schedule which needs explanation more than any other, it. is this. If the Minister will not give an explanation, the item&#34;&#39; will not be passed as quickly as he may think. We shall insist on getting an explanation from some quarter. The facts which have been laid before the Committee show that there is a combine among the manufacturers of confectionery in Australia whose operations are injuriously affecting both retailers and consumers, their object being to restrict trade and to increase prices. In spite of the denials made last night, a price list was read, which shows that increases have been made in a large number of lines - I think over fifty. In view of this fact, will the Minister say that the effect of the duties is not to raise prices? </para>

                            <para>- From the protectionist standard of commercial morality,  perhaps it is regarded as honest to give short weight. I do not expect that any argument would take effect upon the mind of a confirmed and unreasoning protectionist. Such minds have become unreceptive, and impervious to reason . or argument. But there are less hardened members on the Government side of the Chamber, whose minds have not yet become fossilized, and whose brains are still receptive. It&#39; is for their benefit that I am speaking, The writer whose letter I am reading, complains, first, of short weight in boxes. He says - </para>

                        <para>This was so glaringly rampant that though I complained to the traveller about it, and he to the firm, it still went on, and I then brought into the shop my large scales, and weighed the boxes in front of the carters, and required them to put the gross weigh: on the boxes, and initial them, and when empty I again weighed the boxes to ascertain the nett weight received. The traveller told me there was trouble about my delaying the carters, and that I was to weigh them myself, and what was short he would always (and did) allow me for. (I pity the shop-keeper who was not sharp enough to find out the above.) </para>

                        <para>Another grievance - A friend of mine was paying 7d. per lb. for a line. I was being charged 8d. per lb. for the same line, same quality, and by the same traveller. In another case I was paying is. id. per lb. for a line, but another friend of mine was being charged is. 5d. per&#34; lb. for the same line, from the same firm, but not the same traveller. Another unfair practice - Certain lines of toffy at 8d. per lb. are put up in tins, which tins weigh about a lb. The gross weight is  charged,  but only 6d. is allowed for the empty tin ; thus the shopkeepers lose 2d. or more on every tin, if they have not discovered this trick. </para>

                    <para class="block"> Then again, the discount has been (and I have every reason to believe is still) a source, of great complaint. I have been getting 5 per cent., but I find some have been getting 10 per cent., and 15 per cent., whilst one lady who signed our petition to Parliament showed me invoices (two of which I now hold as evidence) on which she received no discount at all ; yet we, as retail confectioners, are asked to trust these firms who are craving for more protection, which will, if carried, injure us still further, and penalize the public. </para>
                    <para>As to the Combine amongst manufacturers of confectionery, in my opinion it not only exists, but is very detrimental to the shopkeepers, and in a lesser degree to the public. One manufacturer who refused to join has been debarred from handling the goods of those in the Combine, and the middleman had to, and did, close their account with the manufacturer because he refused to join the Combine ; and he told me in confidence that he had good reason to believe the Combine has tried to Stop his  supplies  of sugar. I &#39;respectfully submit that there is need for a Government inquiry, and I honestly believe, if instituted, we can procure, evidence that would be the means of showing that a great attempt has been made to introduce the much-dreaded American combine or trust system. </para>
                    <para class="block">I agree with that contention. The writer makes allegations, which I understand he is prepared to substantiate, showing that there is ample reason for  making an inquiry as to the composition and operations of this Combine, and others which are said to be carrying on business in the Commonwealth - and more particularly in Victoria - and whose monopolies we are asked to bolster up by increased duties. This item ought to be postponed until an inquiry has been held, and Parliament has been placed in possession of full information as to the effect upon trade of the operations of these trusts. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so. But the letter bears the signature of a well-known and reputable shopkeeper in this city. Several letters were read yesterday, but no honorable member on this side of the Committee asked that the names of the writers should be disclosed. I have refrained from disclosing the name of the writer of this letter simply because I do not wish to do him an injury bv exposing him to the relentless persecution of this powerful Combine which honorable members of the Labour Party are bolstering up. Three of the largest manufacturers in New South Wales - among them one of the most highly-respected and best-known manufacturers of confectionery in Australia - have admitted that they do not want any increased duty, and that an all-round duty of 2d. per lb. is amply sufficient. If honorable members really desire to grant a genuine preference to the Mother Country, they have a splendid opportunity to do so in this case, seeing that, according to the Treasurer, two-thirds of our importations of confectionery and chocolate come from Great Britain. We should be prepared all the more readily to grant a preference in this case since the labour conditions obtaining in the manufacture of British  confectionery  are all that could be desired. I have here some illustrated pamphlets illustrating the conditions of labour and rates of pay. prevailing in connexion with Cadbury&#39;s establishment. Cadbury&#39;s not only provide the finest possible accommodation for their employes and grant them the best working conditions and high wages, but attend to their social and physical welfare outside their, factory. They provide for them gardens, tennis courts, cricket and football kits, and various other means of taking health-giving exercises. They have also a pension fund arid a scheme for the general improvement of the conditions of their workers. In order that the employes may not have to live under the unhealthy conditions of crowded cities, they have built upon a trust estate some splendid up-to-date dwellings, replete with the most approved hygienic and sanitary conveniences. In short, they have done all they can to advance the physical, mental, and moral welfare of their employes. </para>

                            <para>- I. am told that there are reputable firms which, although perhaps not coming up to the standard of Cadbury&#39;s, observe more than reasonable conditions of labour and pay wages that are in the highest degree satisfactory. It will be seen that in this case the workers in the industry in Australia are not called upon to compete against cheap Continental labour. The proposed duties are almost prohibitive of the importation of the highest class of confectionery, produced by British labour under the conditions I have described. I do not wish it to be inferred that I desire in any way to detract from the conditions which obtain in the industry in Australia. As a matter of fact, in company with a number of honorable members, I visited a local factory some time ago, and I was extremely pleased with the conditions  under which the employe&#39;s labour. But I would point out that under the operation of the old Tariff, which represented a reduction in the duty previously operative in Victoria, employment in this industry has been nearly doubled, and wages have increased by more than 50 per cent. There is no justification, therefore, for the increased duty proposed. Upon the occasion of my visit to the local factory, the proprietor commented upon the satisfactory conditions which obtained in the industry, and pointed with pride to its growth. But there is one item of information which he suppressed. He did not inform us of the extent to which his profits had increased since the imposition of the first Commonwealth Tariff. </para>

                            <para>- Cadbury is not asking for a monopoly or the privilege of dipping his hands into the public Treasury to increase the profits of his business. The Victorian manufacturers are demanding an increase of 275 per cent, on the old rate-, and we have a right to know what are the reasons underlying their demand. The fact is that during the past ten years their profits, must have considerably increased. </para>

                            <para>- I say that even if we admitted British confectionery free, the sales of Australian confectionery would not be affected. In spite of the natural disadvantages under which British confectionery labours in Australia, by cost and length of time in transit, there is a steady demand for it on account of its superior quality. Our manufacturers have not the experience necessary to enable them to produce such a good article, nor have they, the same wide market to cater for. British and Continental manufacturers have the benefit of the markets of the world. They have to compete against the world. But our local manufacturers are restricted to the Australian market. They cannot hope <inline font-style="italic">to compete</inline> with firms like that of Cadbury in the markets of the world, and therefore they cannot afford to purchase the .up-to-date machinery necessary for the production of the highest class of goods. I acknowledge that they produce goods of very excellent quality, .tut I do not think that any body will contend that their production of chocolates is equal in quality to that of </para>

                            <para>- Then they are misleading upon both sides. Probably what the honorable member says is correct. Still, we must accept them as fairly correct averages after making proper allowance for differences, to which I need not refer. The average wage paid in Australia to male operatives in the confectionery industry, is. 30s. 5d., as against the average in Great Britain of  3JS.  In the case of females, the average wage in. Great Britain is 18s. 6d.,. as against 13s. in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- It will thus be seen, that our manufacturers are not called upon to compete against lower-paid labour ir* Great Britain. I would point out to some of my labour friends that not only is the firm of Cadbury&#39;s working upon philanthropic lines, but it is intensely sympathetic with the aims of labour. As evidencing this fact,* I. may mention that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. George</inline> Cadbury, during the recent strike of engineers, contributed <inline font-style="italic">&#163;50</inline> weekly to the union funds, and during Christmas week, he increased his donation to &#163;100. </para>

I have no desire to handicap any local industry. It is the greatest fallacy in the world to suppose that free-traders wish to harm anybody.

Of the total number of hands engaged in the industry in Victoria, 800 are employed by one firm - that of MacRobertson. So that we are asked to grant this increased measure of protection in the interests chiefly of one firm. </para>

                            <para>- I regret. that the necessity arises to combat as vigorously as I have the attempt to impose this duty. At the same time, it must be admitted that no more time has been occupied in this debate than is necessary to place the case clearly before the Committee. It has been stated by at least one retail confectioner in Melbourne, in a letter to the press recently, that, so great is the demand for imported confectionery, as compared with the demand for the local article, that forty-nine boxes of imported milk chocolate can be sold for one of local manufacture. This is evidence that the public taste inclines for the imported article, so far as this particular class of confectionery is concerned. No doubt there are other branches of the trade in which the local product can command a ready sale, and hold its own against competition from any source. Chocolate and cocoa should not be regarded as ordinary confectionery, seeing that they are the staple food of the sick room and the nursery, containing as they do very valuable nutritive properties. A duty such as that proposed by the Government really places an embargo on the best classes of chocolate and cocoa; and we ought to discriminate between such articles and confectionery which is used simply for pleasure. Under free-trade conditions in New South Wales, Messrs. Griffiths Brothers were able, not only to manufacture cocoa, but to successfully compete with the Victorian manufacturers, who were protected by a duty of 3d. per lb. ; and one of the first actions of the Victorian Combine was to endeavour to prevent New South Wales manufacturers from doing business in that State. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robertson</inline> himself, in his evidence given before the Tariff Commission, admits that there is no justification for the proposed duty. He says that the continental competition does not seriously affect his business ; and he added that he did not think that, so far as some of &#34;the continental manufacturers were concerned, he was placed at a disadvantage, because he had been told that the men who made the higher classes of goods were tolerably well paid, receiving <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2,</inline> &#163;3, &#163;4, and in some cases as high as <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline> per week. That furnishes the best proof, if proof be needed, that the proposed &#39;duty is unnecessary. The average wage in Great Britain &#34; pans out &#34; really higher than the average wage paid in Australia; and, in addition, we have <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robertson&#39;s</inline> admission that there is nothing to fear from continental competition. </para>

If they find a <inline font-style="italic">G&#38;vernment</inline> pliant enough to give them anything they like to ask for, they would be foolish not to ask; but I certainly would blame any Parliament which consented to a Government conceding such terms, in face of the overwhelming evidence that we have, and in the full knowledge that thereby there may be created a dangerous, monopoly, injurious to a large section of the public. The Treasurer seems a little restive because this debate has proceeded for a time.

                            <para>- The Treasurer himself is mainly responsible for any debate that may have taken place. If he did not introduce, such unreasonable proposals there would not be the same necessity for hostile criticism. The Treasurer is not satisfied .to accept even the recommendations of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission. How, then, can he expect honorable members, whether protectionists or free-traders, who profess to represent the people, to let his extravagant proposals pass without discussion? If the Treasurer desires a short debate his best plan would be to so revise the Tariff that it will appeal to the common-sense of the Committee. </para>

                            <para>- I visited the MacRobertson factory this morning in connexion with this matter, and I was requested to go into the shop and take down a box. The box was not given to me, but I took it down myself in the presence of the honorable member for Grey, and inside  I  found this slip. Further, a Victorian. Act which was passed last year provides that every article shall carry a tag giving information as to weight and so forth, so that MacRobertsons, if this slip were not included in their boxes of confectionery, would be breaking the law. This, I think, is sufficient to show that the firm referred to is not doing the class of business suggested by the honorable member for Grey ; indeed, the firm has no need to do so. The only argument that the honorable member for Grey can find in opposition to the proposed increase of duty is the fact&#39; that there is a combine in the confectionery trade. We are not dealing with combines now, but with the Tariff. When the time comes for us to deal with combines, we shall, of course, deal with them. </para>

The honorable member for Lang, in a very long speech, told us what Cadbury does in the old country. As a protectionist, I think we should increase our duties so as to compel that firm to come here to carry on its operations. The Australian manufacturers do not fear such competition. </para>

                            <para>- Honorable members opposite, a few days ago, spoke of an industry as not being worth encouraging, because the conditions of employment were not too good. The honorable member for Grey urged that. The confectionery industry, at any rate, should be encouraged, because of the good wages which it pays. I have shown that the statements of the honorable members for Dalley and North Sydney were incorrect, and that the honorable member for Grey objected to the proposals of the Government merely on the ground that there is a combine. But the manufacturers and workers of Australia haying asked for  extra protection, I appeal to the Committee to grant it to them, and to keep out importations which, last year, were valued at  j&#163;i  20,000. We can make our own confectionery. Even the honorable member for Parkes has admitted that Australian confectionery is nearly as good as the imported. He could hardly be expected to say quite as good ; but, twelve months hence, he will find it equally good. I shall have much pleasure in supporting the proposals of the Government. I hope that Ministers will stick to their guns, and carry the rates set down in the schedule. </para>

                        <para>. - I regret that the debate is not proceeding more rapidly. If second-reading speeches are to be made on every item, it seems to me that we shall not dispose of the Tariff for another two years ; but if the Government are prepared to adopt reasonable measures to expedite the discussion of the duties I shall be very glad to assist them. My desire is that we shall push on with the business of the House in order that the affairs of the Commonwealth may be attended to in the way that the people expect. I have listened to this debate with a good deal of interest, and although I do not profess to have an expert knowledge of the manufacture of confectionery, I think that a case has been made out for an increased duty. Under the States Tariffs the duties on confectionery were as follows.: - Victoria, 2d. per lb. ; New South Wales and Queensland, 4d. per lb. ; South, Australia, 3d. per lb. ; Tasmania and, I understand, Western Australia, 4d. per lb. Under the Victorian Tariff certain drawbacks were allowed in respect to sugar and glucose used in the manufacture of confectionery, the effect of which was to place the manufacturers in a much better position than the mere imposition of a duty of 2d. per lb. would suggest. Under the first Federal Tariff the duties were reduced to id. and 2d. per. lb., with the result that the value of our importations of confectionery increased from ^71,575 in 1902 to &#163;110,281 in 1906. There was a steady increase of imports under the old Tariff. </para>

                    <para class="block">I am prepared to admit that the conditions of labour in the old country are in certain respects very reasonable. There is no occasion in this connexion to talk about the existence of sweating in Great Britain. We know that most of the manufactures imported from the old land are made under very favorable circumstances. But it is our duty to look first of all to the industries of Australia. Older nations have to compete with exportations from Great Britain, and although they should be able to carry on their industries under a much lower Tariff than Australia can do, we find that they are not doing so. I have in mind Canada, the United States of America, and Germany, which are not exposed to the same dangers that confront us, and do not need population as we do. The industries of Germany and the United States, and their sources of production, are well developed. </para>

                            <para>- That opens up another phase of the question. I am not greatly impressed with the argument that is con,stantly advanced that our importers labour under special disadvantages owing to the long distance freights which they have to bear. Ocean freights at present are extremely low, and I feel satisfied that if we were to calculate the amount of freightage required to distribute goods from Melbourne or Sydney to every other part of the Commonwealth we should find that the manufacturers in those cities have no advantage over the manufacturers of Great Britain, who are distributing their goods throughout Australia. I shall probably be met with the reply_ that the Melbourne manufacturer should confine the distribution of his goods to Victoria ; but  .1  would remind the Committee that our intention in establishing Inter-State free-trade was that manufactories indigenous to the different States should be able to distribute their goods and wares, all over the Commonwealth. Taking that fact into consideration, I fail to understand in what respect the manufacturer in Melbourne or in Sydney is in a better position in regard to the distribution of his goods over the Commonwealth than is the manufacturer in Great Britain who exports to Australia. The argument as to the natural protection enjoyed by our producers is one which if properly sifted will be found to have very little force. According to the Customs returns, the percentage of duty on confectionery under the old Tariff was about 25  5228 .  <inline font-style="italic">Tariff</inline> &#91;REPRESENTATIVES.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">{Confectionery, &#38;c).</inline> per cent. The Canadian duty is equal to about 40 per cent. ; the duties under the United States Tariff range from 50 to 100 per cent. ; and those under the German Tariff from about 40 to 50 per cent. I think that the duty proposed by the Government is rather high, and my present intention is to support the amendment foreshadowed by the honorable member for Fawkner, that the general duty be reduced to 3d. per lb. and that against imports from Great Britain to 2&#189;d. per lb. The duty of 3d. per lb. would be equal to about 37&#189; per cent., or less than those imposed on confectionery by the well-established nations to which I have referred. I hope that the Government will take into consideration the possibility of being able to meet the honorable member for Fawkner, whose proposal I shall have much pleasure in supporting. </para>

They are prepared to stretch their fiscal conscience to the extent of giving the manufacturers in Melbourne all that they have ever asked for. The Tariff Commission, having sifted their statements, recommended a duty of 2d. instead of the 3d. per lb. for which they asked. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robertson</inline> appeared before the Commission, the  Chairman  put to him the following question - </para>

                    <para>My honorable friends in the Opposition corner will therefore see that in the generosity of their hearts, and after analyzing the whole situation, they are falling into the position prepared for them by the Protectionist Association of Victoria.. It is evident as we proceed with the consideration of these duties that the schedule has been specially prepared for the purpose of enabling the Government to make concessions to the Committee. The statement made by the Minister and published in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> on Monday last is quite correct ; he expected that reductions would be made, and, in framing the schedule, provided for them. This is one of the duties which have been specially set up in order that they may again be removed by the Minister with a show of apparent generosity and fairness. All that the manufacturing confectioners of Victoria have ever asked for is a duty of 3d. per lb., and the Minister simply imposed a duty of 3¾d., in order that he should be able to take off the extra ¾d. when pressed to do so and still reach the point for which he set out - giving the manufacturing confectioners of Victoria the duties they want or expect. It seems that the industry has been suffering from the imposition of duties on its raw materials. That is made clear by the evidence given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robertson</inline> when before the Commission. </para>

                            <para>- He proceeded to give particulars about the cost of glucose. Glucose has not been increased in price. It is quite clear that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robertson</inline> was prospering under the operation of the old Tariff, and all ;that he asked was that he should be relieved of some of the duties which were imposed upon his raw materials. If those duties were retained, he desired that the duty should be increased to 3d. per lb. &#39;The Government, in their generosity, propose to make it 3&#167;d. per lb. It seems to me that Victorian manufacturers have merely to prefer a request in order to have it granted. Why should this Parliament, which represents, not only the manufacturers, but also the consumers, accept the statement of any manufacturer who chooses to come along ? We do not act in that way in connexion with ordinary business bargains. So far as I am able to ascertain, we have every reason to be proud of the position which our manufacturers occupy. I only hope that they will continue to grow and prosper. Should the time ever arise when they are able to supply all the requirements of the Commonwealth in the matter of confectionery, none will rejoice more than I will, so long as they supply them upon reasonable conditions. I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robertson</inline> conducts an establishment which is a credit to him in every way. I have tasted his confectionery, and I pronounce it to be excellent. I only hope that great prosperity will attend the efforts of those who have embarked their capital in this enterprise. But it seems to me that they have already attained a fair measure of success, and that there is no justification for piling the proposed duties upon the consumers. Statistics show that last year, in Victoria alone, there was ah increase in the number of hands employed in this industry of 248. The honorable member for Yarra stated last evening that the importations of confectionery have materially increased during the past few years. But even he had to admit that there has been a large increase in the local manufacture of confectionery. The fact is that the increased importation is the best possible index to the increased prosperity of Australia.. In good seasons our importation of confectionery must necessarily increase to a greater extent than the local product, because that importation consists largely of particular brands of confectionery which have not yet attained to their proper development in the Commonwealth. Seeing that the industry is doing well - that it is prospering in every way - we ought to let well alone, instead of imposing upon these articles higher duties, which will most assuredly be passed on to the consumer. The honorable member for Batman has made a statement in reference to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stedman,</inline> of Sydney. It is almost a pity that the names of individuals have been mentioned during this debate. It would have been far better if the names of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robertson</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stedman</inline> had been kept out of the discussion, and if we had debated this question in an impersonal way. I do not know any of these gentlemen personally, but I believe that they are men of high repute and of strict integrity. Reference has been made to the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stedman</inline> did not appear before- the Tariff Commission to ask for an increased duty. But his absence has been explained by the honorable member for Batman, who has declared that he deputed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robertson</inline> to make the request for him. Why should <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stedman,</inline> who is almost solely an importer of confectionery, depute <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robertson,</inline> who is interested in its manufacture, to represent him before the Tariff Commission? The fact that he did so is conclusive evidence, to. my mind, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stedman</inline> is a member of the Confectionery Combine, which! has now reached Inter-State proportions, and whose operations, I venture to say, will have to be investigated very shortly. Everybody knows that this Combine is spreading all over Australia, and that it not only controls the manufacture of confectionery here, but that it virtually controls the importation of chocolate as well. I think that the Treasurer ought to promise to have a strict inquiry made into the conditions surrounding  this industry. If what is alleged be true, the Confectionery Combine is already beginning to act in restraint of trade. We are told that a higher duty is required upon confectionery. Why? </para>

What are the  ingredients which enter into the composition of confectionery? One of its constituents is milk. But I have been informed that all the milk consumed upon MacRobertson&#39;s premises is Nestles imported milk. It is really wonderful how these manufacturers prefer an imported raw product to a locally-manufactured article. Another ingredient is sugar, upon which there is a high duty, and which, therefore, according to the dictum of the Government Whip, ought to be cheap. </para>

Consequently, according to the doctrine of protectionists, these articles ought to be very much cheaper than they would be otherwise. There should be an abundance of these cheap raw products for the manufacture of confectionery in Australia. Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robertson</inline> had to cut right across that theory when he was giving evidence before the Tariff Commission.

I . am now dealing with the evidence which was given before the Tariff Commission; anu all the figures show that the industry was flourishing and prosperous in every . way.

                            <para>- It is marvellous how some honorable members are able to correct the figures of official statisticians who devote their lives to the work. It would appear that the figures have&#39; to be turned&#39; round until they express entirely what some honorable members desire them to express. . The wages paid seem to be fair and reasonable ; and I point out that the Australian manufacturers are competing not against cheap or pauper labour abroad, but against the best paid labour in the world. </para>

I am not sure, however, that there is such a difference between the wages paid in Australia and the wages paid elsewhere, particularly in Great Britain. I find that in Australia the average wage for apprentices, improvers and full-grown men is 30s. 5d. per week; and I regard that as very fair. </para>

                            <para>- That average wage applies only to men and boys; the average wage for females is 13s. a week. I have been told that the average wage paid by Cadbury is a little higher than that paid in Australia, but I confess that I do not make that statement with any degree of confidence. Whether the wages alleged to be paid by such firms as Cadbury&#39;s applies to men only, or includes apprentices and improvers, I am unable to say, and therefore I cannot make a comparison with that confidence I otherwise should feel. The average wage for men at Cadbury&#39;s works is said to be 31s. per week and for females 18s. 6d. per week; and I give the figures for what they are worth. Only this morning we were told that in the case of another cocoa manufacturer at Home the average wage is even higher than that paid at Cadbury&#39;s factory, being for men over 18 years of age 32s. a. week. I submit that no case has been made out for the high duties proposed. This industry was flourishing and holding its own against the confectionery of the world before the duties </para>

In spite of what the honorable member for Batman says, prices are being increased and passed on to the consumer, all being strictly regulated by means of the Combine. I should like the Government to investigate this matter, and see that the operations of the Combine are legitimate and above board. I. do not object to combines

                        because  cooperative  or associationsal production must always have an economical result. But when combinations begin to act in restraint of trade, and by regulating prices and discounts, make the conditions a great deal worse for the consumer, the law must step in. and control them sternly and strictly. I am quite at one with the dictum laid down by the  President  of the United States, that we must make our choice between nationalization and the regulating and controlling of combines; and I am for control in a very impartial and, at the same time, stern manner. In my opinion, a case has already been made out for strict inquiry by the Government. Unquestionably there exists an association, entrance to which is governed by a severe entrance fee, and a substantial subscription in proportion to the amount of business done, and the interests to be protected. The Combine regulates prices, and, by forcing the middlemen to deal exclusively with it, causes the latter also to combine. Further the Combine regulates the prices charged by the retailer to the consumer, and, in some instances, takes away, or fixes at a lower rate, the discounts which aforetime were proper to the trade. All this indicates that this Combine, like all others, while entrenching itself, and getting within its grasp the whole ramifications of the retail trade, is ever seeking a little more for itself than was considered fair previously. That is the point at which the Government ought to step in. Abundant proof was furnished last night by the honorable member for Grey that the Combine is extending its operations all over Australia; and that very shortly, if it has not now, it will have the control of the whole of the industry. Now and again a manufacturer may stand out; but he is made to suffer. I make no allegation regarding the operations of the Combine except such as have been made to me, and I simply urge that there is a case for inquiry.
                    </para>
                    <para class="block">If  it be found that the Combine is conducting its operations in any but a legitimate way, the Government: ought to apply existing legislation, and if that be found not sufficient, let us. have other legislation, in order that restraint of trade may not be permitted.. &#39;We cannot complain &#39; of combines as combines. Manufacturers have every right to associate in order to protect their proper interests, but they have no right to go further, and unduly exploit the public. </para>

                            <para>- The Treasurer may take the insult if he likes; he has been courting it the whole time. It is proposed to increase the duties outrageously, and yet there has not been a word of explanation from the Treasurer. The honorable gentleman says nothing here; but the moment he gets to Sydney he has the effrontery to say that he proposed these duties in the Tariff only in order that they might be taken off. That is the kind of thing we have in this Chamber every day. </para>

He made some outrageous statements in London, and then contradicted the reports when he came back. I ask him, in the interests of Australia, to investigate the charges against the Confectionery Combine. If they are untrue, the Combine should not lie under them any longer than is necessary to disprove them, while, if they are correct, stern action should be taken to repress the practices which have been spoken of. </para>

Would it not be better for him to make explanations now and again, when they are  asked for, than to sit there insulting every one? It would certainly facilitate business. In my judgment, no case has been made out for increasing these duties, and therefore I shall vote against the Government  proposals. </para>

                        <para>.- As we are now only at item 45, and must deal with 444 items before we can finish the Tariff, I shall make my remarks as short as possible, although I have a good deal that I should like to say, and much, no doubt, that honorable members would be glad to hear. To a certain extent, the discussion of this item has been laboured. It has been said that it is necessary for the protection of the confectionery industry to increase fEe duties on confectionery ; but, from the statements made from all quarters, I judge that, of all industries in Australia, it least needs assistance. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robertson</inline> told the Tariff Commission that, thirteen years ago, when he employed comparatively few hands, he was not satisfied with the Tariff. </para>

                            <para>- No protectionist is ever satisfied, however high the duties. Like a&#39; child crying for the moon, he does not know what he wants, half the time. In those days, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robertson</inline> had a protective duty of 2d., and was very anxious to exclude the better class of confectionery, such as sells at 2s. and 3s. a lb. To exclude such confectionery, he wished for a duty of 4d.  It has been stated in evidence, however, that much of this confectionery cannot be made in Australia, and to make the duties on it very high, would be to increase the taxation of our people, and destroy the revenue by lessening importations. It would furthermore deprive poor children of what may be regarded .by some as luxuries, though they have really become necessaries; because what we regard in the first instance as a luxury, gets to be a necessary when we have become accustomed to it. .The honorable member for Melbourne Ports will find that that remark applies to the possession of a seat in Parliament. Regarding the comparison of wages that has been made, I think that there can be little doubt but that English wages are higher than Australian wages. Furthermore, only eight hours a day are worked in England. The&#39;  chairman  of Messrs. Cadbury Brothers, whose statements, I presume, can be accepted with the utmost confidence, stated some time ago that the firm&#39;s employe&#39;s get through more work in eight hours than do continental workers in ten or even twelve, and that although they are paid higher wages, actually less is spent on labour. But the employes of that firm, and of other English firms, enjoy many advantages which are not granted to the operatives of Australian manufacturers. Notwithstanding that there is no protection in Great Britain, wages in this industry are higher there than they have been in Victoria, while on the Continent they are also very high. </para>

Although the honorable member for Parramatta spoke for only twenty minutes, he said more in that time, and with more effect, than I could say in three hours. I wish merely to add, in conclusion, my protest against the manner in which members have been taken round in four-horse drags to visit the various Melbourne factories.

                        <para>.- No doubt the honorable member for Hunter, finding the Committee in a serious mood, wished, for lack of argument, to crack a good joke. Surely one of his kind and generous nature would not accuse honorable members of being bought by the present of a box of sweetmeats, and a ride on a drag. The acting leader of the Opposition has said that in no country in the world is the protection as high as that now suggested. </para>

                            <para>- Not if that machinery could be manufactured here. The Government propose a duty of 3¾d. per lb. on confectionery, which is equal to a duty of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;35</inline> per ton. In Italy there is a duty of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;40</inline> per ton. On cocoa and chocolate a duty of 2&#188;d., or, roughlyspeaking, <inline font-style="italic">&#163;21</inline> per ton, is proposed by the Government. In Italy there is a duty of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;52</inline> per ton upon that commodity. Cocoa beans, which are admitted free into Australia as one of the raw materials of the manufacturing confectioner, are subjected to a duty of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;40</inline> per ton under the Italian Tariff ; whilst ground paste, upon which we have a duty of¾d. per lb., is dutiable in Italy at &#163;40 per ton. I recognise that there is a good deal of truth in the statements made by the honorable member for Grey. I believe that there is a combine in existence in relation to this industry, but I do not blame the manufacturers for combining. I can understand business men, who are called upon to grant a discount of 15 per cent. in some cases, and of 5 per cent. in others, agreeing upon a fixed rate of discount, so that all their customers shall be placed on an equal footing. When we have  submitted to us a Bill to deal with combines, I shall vote for it, so that we may control them, and prevent those who purchase their products from being ruined, as they might possibly be if these organizations were allowed to go untrammelled. I am not going to say that the Combine in relation to this industry is doing anything that is very unjust. I believe that some men have been bought out and paid less than they ought to have received, but I am not going to blame all the manufacturers for that sort of thing. Factory legislation now applies to the industry, and at present the employes are working under fair conditions. I do not suggest that they are as good as those prevailing in Cadbury&#39;s establishment, but I hope that they will be. Cadbury&#39;s are to be commended for the treatment of their employes. Fry&#39;s also treat their employes well, and the same may be said of Rowntree Brothers. The members of these three firms belong to the Society of Friends, but Rowntree Brothers were more loyal than were Cadbury&#39;s to the principles of their society when they received the offer of a contract to supply ^30,000 worth of chocolate for the troops in South Africa. As members of a society that is opposed to war, they refused to take that offer, as they did not believe in the wicked South African war, whereas Cadbury&#39;s did not hesitate to accept it. I shall vote for the higher duty proposed by the Government, but if the honorable member for Fawkner is prepared to agree to an amendment of his amendment, so as to provide for the imposition of a duty of 3&#167;d. per lb. on imports from foreign countries, and of  2fd.  per lb. on British imports - thus granting a preference of id. per lb. to British imports - I shall be happy to support him. </para>

I think honorable members will agree that I am usually very careful regarding the substantial accuracy of any information that I put before the Committee, and that if at any time I make a mistake I am perfectly willing to correct it as soon as it is pointed out to me. It is true that I said yesterday that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stedman</inline> had made representations to the Tariff Commission in favour- of a lower duty. The honorable member for Batman said that it was on that ground that I opposed the Government proposition. </para>

                        <para>Manufacturing confectioners of Sydney and Newcastle commanding New South Wales trade have been holding two and more weekly meetings for past ten weeks, and under the style of New South Wales Manufacturing Confectioners&#39; Protective Society, have combined to raise prices enormously under penalty. The increase of some leading lines was notified to the shopkeeper Monday, the twenty-first inst., by circular, and printed information is given that lists of further lines are in preparation, and will be issued in a few days. Present printed quotations of the Combine as compared  with  those in existence prior to the twenty-first instant show the following increase : - Common mixed lollies, from twopence three-farthings to threepence farthing. Conversations, Scotch mixtures, and peppermints from threepence and threepence halfpenny to fourpence halfpenny per pound. London  mixtures  from threepence farthing and threepence halfpenny to fourpence halfpenny.  Jelly  jubes, threepence  three-farthings  to fivepence halfpenny. Caramels, frosted and cream, from sixpence to ninepence. Jelly beans from sixpence halfpenny to ninepence. Chocolate creams and mixtures from sixpence to eightpence. The writer, after thirteen years in the retail confectionery of this city, and holding two of the leading retail shops, exclusively confectionery, aggregating rentals approximating four figures per annum, was told only yesterday by the principal of a firm of over fifty years&#39; standing in this city and a member of Combine, that while in the past the manufacturer waited on the retailer, in future the manufacturer would be master. If leading vendors are plainly told this, what about aged spinsters and widows, by whom this trade is largely conducted outside business centres? Could say a good deal more on information received first hand, but in the absence of documentary evidence desist. </para>

                    <para class="block">The accuracy of the statements which I made last night  has been challenged in some quarters. I affirmed that prices had been increased in Victoria, and in support of my allegation I quoted not twenty-five lines - as stated by the honorable member for Batman - but fifty-nine lines upon which an increase had taken place. These increases upon the old rates range from .&#163;4 13s. per ton to ,&#163;37 6s. 8d. per ton. It has been argued that the increases are due to the duties which have been imposed upon the raw materials of the industry, but I venture to say that protectionists will experience a great difficulty in proving that. Last evening I quoted from a letter in which the statement was made, not only that prices had been increased, but that short weights were being delivered. The accuracy of that assertion has been challenged. I have since been informed, not only that short weights have been delivered once, but that they have been delivered repeatedly even after complaints have been made by the parties aggrieved. The honorable member&#34; for Batman has declared that every box of confectionery sent out by a certain firm contains an enclosure intimating that if there is any short weight upon a box it will be made up by the manufacturer upon being informed of it. There- upon, I asked him whether it was the practice of the firm to send out a similar enclosure with every box, and he replied that it was. I then sent down to a very reputable firm in this city, and obtained two boxes qf confectionery, which were opened in the presence of witnesses, who can testify that neither of them contained the enclosure to which reference has been made. If further proof of my statement is necessary I am in a position to supply it. It is generally admitted that a confectionery combine does exist. Indeed, there has been no effort to refute the statements I made last night. Not only is there a combine, but it is so effective that it almost succeeded in confining the trade to a particular State, and it has succeeded in arranging that no goods shall be sold under the price fixed by itself. The idea of the honorable member for Wimmera that under protection competition protects the consumer and the retailer is not borne out by facts. The majority of honorable members seem to concern themselves entirely with the men who are employed in the industry; but we must not forget that there are hundreds of retailers, most of them people of small means, who are equally deserving of consideration. By means&#39; of this Combine retailers may be practically fleeced, whilst at the same time it has been arranged to pay 15 per cent, to the middlemen. The Government propose the magnificent preference to Great Britain of Jd.&#39; out of an increased duty amounting to 1¾d. Of &#163;116,000 worth of imports last year &#163;93,674 worth came from the United Kingdom, as compared with only &#163;1,000 worth from France, and &#163;1,200 worth from Germany. The industry is in such a sound position that last year the exports were valued at &#163;13,781, and in spite of the duty of 2d. per lb. in New Zealand: Australian manufacturers can export to that Dominion and undersell English manufacturers. In my opinion, the proposed duty is most iniquitous, and yet not one word in justification of it have we heard from the&#39; Treasurer. When we ask for fair play and honest trading we are&#39; accused of supporting the foreigner; but surely no one can say that the retailers of Australia are foreigners, or that they are not just as much entitled to consideration as are the manufacturers. In the face of what has been proved in connexion with this Combine, we are told that we must leave it to be dealt with under the new protection scheme. In my opinion. 5236 <inline font-style="italic">Tariff</inline> &#91;REPRESENTATIVES.&#93;(Confectionery,&#38;c.). however, this is the time to teach the manufacturers that if they are given the advantage of high duties they must deal honestly with others who have as much right to live as they have. While we are waiting for the Government to introduce the new protection legislation, and, probably, to amend legislation already in existence, the retailers are left in the hands of the Combine. It is proposed that when there is clear evidence that prices are unwarrantably&#39; increased, or that there is a combine created to take unfair advantage of the public, duties shall be reduced, and I am only asking honorable members to take that step now. If we are in earnest we have an opportunity to show the manufacturers that they will not be allowed to enter into a cold-blooded combination for the purpose of fleecing those with whom they have to do business. </para>

                            <para>- The greater part of my life has been devoted to the protection of the working man, but I recognise that there are many others concerned besides the employes. If only the working men have to be considered here, then the sooner I know the fact the better. I take it that we are sent to Parliament to deal fairly with all concerned - not only with employes but with consumers - and all I am asking is that we should give the retailer a fair opportunity. This Combine should have the slap in the face it deserves, and be taught a lesson. If manufacturers come to Parliament for high duties, they must not be permitted to form themselves into combines for the purpose of robbing the public. </para>

If we do not get more business done during the ordinary sittings next week, we shall have to meet earlier or sit later, or, perhaps, do both. I am sure that honorable members will not take umbrage at that proposal, seeing that the Government are anxious to pass the Tariff before Christmas, and that cannot be done unless we apply ourselves steadily to the work. Next week honorable members will be asked to sit each night until a certain amount of progress has been made. </para>

                        <para>. - I cannot help feeling amused at the remarks of the  deputy  leader of the Opposition, because he is such a very courteous member himself, and <inline font-style="italic">no</inline> one can complain very much of any strong language used up to the present in these debates. I am exceptionally courteous, as the honorable member knows, and so his remarks are out of place. If at any time I say anything which may be considered harsh, it should be remembered that I try to control myself, but it is very tiresome to sit here listening to lengthy speeches and repetitions when I am anxious to get on with business. If I were to give the explanations which the honorable member asks for, they would lead to about four times the discussion we now have. I say as little as possible, in order to shorten the debates. </para>
