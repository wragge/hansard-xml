                        <para>- Earlier in the day, the honorable member was good enough to intimate to me his intention to ask this question. In reply, I may inform him that 19,000 Martini-Enfield rifles have been ordered. These would have been to hand in sufficient time to enable them to be used at the approaching Victorian Rifle Association Competitions, but, consequent upon some alterations which it was found necessary to make, their delivery has been delayed, so that I do not think that their arrival can be expected earlier than November. With regard to the supply of new rifle barrels, I may say that when the shortage was discovered an unsuccessful effort was made to obtain a stock from India. There are only 100 new barrels in this State, and 1,000 have been applied for. Sixteen hundred have been ordered. The first 200 of these will be delivered in England during the current month, and&#39; the residue in October. They should begin to arrive in Australia in October. </para>

That is - the reason why I do not wish to give the information which the honorable member desires. I have not yet obtained the opinion of a medical officer upon the effect which the circulation of the document might have upon the public, from the stand-point from which the honorable member regards the matter. </para>

The Commission paid to the New South Wales Public Works Department is not merely for paying accounts, but for expenses of supervision, travelling, advertising, plans, &#38;c, in connexion with Commonwealth works carried out by that Department throughout the whole of the State. The permanent officer referred to does not compile the statement of amounts due to the State, and could not perform the services for which the Commissioners pay without the creation of a large Commonwealth works staff, operating over the State, to assist him. </para>

                        <para>When progress was reported on Friday afternoon, I was directing attention to the great need that Australia has for immigration. Honorable members will realize clearly that as the Australians are perhaps the greatest producing people in the world, they must be fully occupied at the present time; and as we hope to create extra work for our people through the instrumentality of the Tariff, and a proper system of protection, I feel sure that that extra work cannot be done unless we have extra hands to do it. This question of immigration is the most important one that Australia has to solve. I have received letters from all parts of the continent pointing out the great scarcity of workmen. I should like to quote from a letter that has been published in a&#39; newspaper upon this question. It is signed by Messrs. Sargood Brothers, who, in addition to being large importers, are now, I am glad to say, doing a great deal of manufacturing work locally. The gist of the letter is as follows - </para>

                        <para>Our experience during the last twelve months is that we cannot obtain sufficient labour to meet the demand. At present we have a large number of machines idle. We have consequently advertised and used every endeavour to obtain the necessary labour to keep all our machines going, but without success, owing to the scarcity of skilled workers. We are not alone in this respect, and our statement can be verified by many other manufacturers in this branch of the trade. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. I think the statement I have read emphasizes my contention that there is at present a great scarcity of labour. If we are going to encourage, as I hope we shall, the expansion of our industries, where are we to obtain the necessary labour ? That is a point that deserves the most earnest consideration of the Government. If we are to stimulate the growth of manufactures, I am sure it will be our desire to do so in a whole-hearted manner, and, therefore, the labour phase of the question is one that we cannot afford to overlook. A great opportunity to secure an increased population was missed a few years ago when General Booth came to Australia with the object of arranging to carry out a great colonizing scheme which he had in hand. We thought at the time that he would possibly introduce into Australia a lot of the riff-raff of Europe, and, naturally, we were opposed to such a class of immigration. Time has shown, however, that he had something very different in view. I propose to read a short extract from an interview which a representative of the <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> had with General Booth, and which was published on  29th  July last. In that interview, General Booth is reported to have said - </para>

It is on the main line of the Santa Fe railway, and has a depot, &#38;c. The land was bought from the Amity Land and Irrigation Company. The amount allowed to each colonist is 20 acres, every purchaser being allowed to make his own choice.

It would seem that the price of land in Canada is really higher than it is in Australia, and, therefore, I hold that we should not be afraid to take action so long as we have satisfactory organization and management. </para>

                            <para>- That is a very pertinent question. It may be that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Haggard</inline> was referring to the price of each block, and not to the price per acre. We have in Australia vast areas of Crown lands which by means of irrigation schemes could be devoted to closer settlement. Land so treated could be subdivided into 20-acre blocks, and would provide for the settlement of a very large population amid comfortable surroundings. </para>

                            <para>- It should Le done. As showing the progress made, the total equity of redemption for thirty-two colonists amounts to &#163;7,450, and&#39; the total value of land, live stock, improvements, &#38;c, belonging to the colonists amounts to some &#163;19,000. That shows that the question can be. and has been, tackled in a business-like manner. All we are doing is to talk year after year about immigration, which, I admit, is a grand platform word. Nothing rouses an audience more than the mention of &#34; immigration &#34; or &#34; irrigation,&#34; and yet we do not seem to get any further forward. I should like to see the Government take really practical steps in this direction, leaving the locked up lands to be dealt with, as they are being dealt with now, by the States. The Government should launch out, and see if they cannot get some organization to assist in &#34;the work. I have no particular fancy for the Salvation Army, except that it could follow up the good work that it has done elsewhere. As a business man, I consider that it is always as well to see what people are doing somewhere else, and then to follow them and obtain the value of their experience. Then we can do the work in the most up-to-date fashion adopted in other parts of the world. </para>

                            <para>- The dual control is of course a very great trouble. I am very glad that the Government have provided, for this year at any rate, for the payment of the Naval Subsidy of &#163;200,000 to the British Government , for the protection afforded us by the British Fleet and the facilities offered for training our men. Opportunity is given for 500 Australians to be trained as seamen. Looking at the question from a mere bargaining point of view, Australia has made a very good bargain, but that point of view is about the last which any good Britisher ought to take. Still it is a viewpoint that must be considered. The &#163;200,000 is money very well spent. We must make provision of some sort for our, local defence, but in that direction we shall have to proceed very slowly. It must be a long while before we can do the blue water work ourselves. Meanwhile, if we can get the British Navy to do it for us at the small cost of ,&#163;200,000 a year, we ought to look at the arrangement a great many times before we cancel it. The agreement seems an excellent one. I do not .like it to be said that Australia is not doing her part. Statements of that kind always seem to be seized upon, I will not say by our enemies, but at any rate by those who are not friendly to us on the other side of the world, and are made a great deal more of than those who originate them expect. I notice a sneer at Australia in the last edition of the London <inline font-style="italic">Punch</inline> to hand. With regard to the launching of the <inline font-style="italic">Bellerophon,</inline> a fine new British man-of-war, <inline font-style="italic">Punch</inline> states that the Australians have this time excelled themselves in generosity by sending a. bottle of Australian wine to smash on the bows of the ship. Of course, that is a very good joke, but when one is away from one&#39;s country, travelling in England, as I do sometimes, that sort of joke hurts a good deal, and I do not like it. I always reply that Australia has done all that she has been asked to do. The naval agreement was drawn up by&#39; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain,</inline> acting for Great Britain, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr., now Sir Edmund,</inline> Barton, on behalf of Australia. No doubt they had the whole circumstances of the case and all possible information before them, and came to an honorable agreement. It was put before the Australian Parliament and ratified, and has been carried out to the letter. It is entirely wrong to blame Australia for not doing her part, because she is doing, first of all, all that she was asked to do, and, in the second&#39; place, far more than any other dependency of the Empire. Yet it is almost impossible to persuade anybody in the old country that Australia is. doing more than Canada in the defence of the Empire. I am. very anxious to see Australia make a start in naval defence in the form of submarines and torpedo boats, so that we may eventually take a self-respecting position, and; do our own fighting. Still&#39;, it must be a good many years before we can expect to take the seas in anything like a respectable way. I wish to make it absolutely clear that it is to assist in the great work of the defence of the Empire that I desire to see the naval agreement continued, and also to see Australia make a beginning with her navy and naval defence. That will be in the interests of the great scheme of the naval defence of the Empire. It must be  in the interests of the&#39; Empire as a. whole for us to have good coaling stations, well defended, and a fleet of torpedo boats and submarines capable of dealing with any chance cruiser that may come along. For the reasons I have stated I am pleased that the agreement with the British Government is not to be hastily cancelled. I desire to refer shortly to the question of the taking over of the States debts. One remark made by the honorable member for Parkes in that connexion last week greatly impressed me. He very ably brought out the fact that States debts to the extent of &#163;80,000,000 have to be converted within the next ten years, and showed that the cost of conversion at present prices - the loans being at par, and having to be converted at a very much lower price - would mean, on a 3 per cent, basis, a loss to us of about &#163;18,000,000. I think that is a little more than will have to be paid, because, fortunately, those loans are nearly all at a higher rate than 3 per cent. Therefore, it is not likely that we shall &#39;have to pay such a large sum as ,&#163;18,000, 000 for their conversion, even if the money market does not improve. Still, from that point of view alone, the question is one which the Commonwealth Government ought to take seriously in hand, and look straight in the face, because those loans are maturing, and if the money market remains as it is now, &#39; I can assure honorable members, as one having a good deal to do with financial matters, that it will be almost impossible to convert them at anything short of a disastrous rate. The question ought to be looked at very carefully. We have a considerable time in front of us yet. What we should do is to take time by the forelock, so that, when the due date arrives, it will not be necessary for us to go cap in hand to the money-lenders, and ask them to renew the loans on terms disastrous to Australia. With the exercise of forethought, I feel sure that the loans can be renewed on fairly advantageous terms. la the case of any future loans I hope we shall adopt the system which is now being adopted by the Victorian Government, of making the stock mature at short dates, but retaining the option to redeem it either then or -at any later period which may suit the Government. The public have taken up those loans very well at the same price as debentures that mature at a fixed date. The system has the advantage that the Government can choose the time  when they will repay the advances. That is a point which I emphasize, in&#62; order that there may be no possibility of its escaping notice when the time comes for the issue of any fresh loans. </para>

A suggestion has been made that there ought to be a continuous Commission sitting on the Tariff. Anything more awful for Australian manufacturers and merchants of all kinds than to have the Tariff question constantly ripped up by a continuous Commission 1 cannot imagine. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad to hear that, because the continuous irritation would be terrible. If - we do require a Commission, &#34;it is one to ascertain how best the States debts may be taken over, and in what way advantageous terms may be made for the renewal of the loans amounting to &#163;80,000,000 which become due in the next ten years. This is not a question we can expect a Treasurer, however able, to grapple with,- because it is one that requires constant attention. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bent,</inline> the Treasurer of Victoria, has certainly made most admirable arrangements, for the renewal 0 the next two Victorian loans which become due; but he has taken all the money  off the market in that State. Nothing could be obtained from the Savings Bank of Victoria, because every penny of the money of that institution is hypothecated until those loans mature and are removed from the market. I am sure it would not be possible to get much money in Victoria, though I fancy <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bent</inline> has had &#34;feelers&#34; out in the other States. In saying this, I am not betraying any confidence, because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bent</inline> has not spoken to me about the matter; but I may say that I have no doubt on the point. As I say, I know that the Savings Bank funds of Victoria are hypothecated for the renewal of Victorian loans which become due shortly,  and that removes a great deal of the money which would otherwise be available. We are face to face with the renewal of loans to the enormous sum of &#163;80,000,000 within the next ten years, and we are taking no practical steps so far as I can see - though the Treasurer may be doing something without letting any one know - to anticipate that time. I think it might be as well to appoint a small Commission to look into the matter, and also to consider the question of a sinking fund. I do not know whether the Government propose that there should be a Commission to consider the question of the transfer of the States debts, but honorable members of this House, including the honorable member for Kooyong, the honorable member for Mernda, and the right honorable member for Swan, have each gone into the matter thoroughly, and have afforded us very valuable information. This is not the sort of matter which can be settled in a day; it ought to be dealt with most thoroughly if we desire to save Australia from being placed in a very unpleasant position. </para>

                            <para>- The Treasury officials might do the work, but it would be hardly fair to ask them to do so, considering the magnitude of the question. I do not think the .House would be prepared to accept -the statements of the Treasury officials, unless they were indorsed by the Treasurer or a small Commission such as I have indicated. </para>

                            <para>- That may be so., but I think that one of the objects of the creation of the Commonwealth was the taking over of the debts of the States ; and in this connexion I am of opinion that the precedent of Canada ought to be followed. I know that Canada does not borrow a great deal; but I always feel that the Commonwealth stock would command a rate which cannot be commanded by any State stock. One consideration that caused me to vote for Federation was that a good consolidated Commonwealth stock would command a price which would mean a considerable saving of interest to the people of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- The Treasurer is quite right in that desire. We should not do anything to irritate -the States, but there may come a time when the Commonwealth will have to do its duty regardless of what the States think. Of course, that time ought to be put off as long as possible; but I hope the Treasurer will look into this matter, which is of vital consequence. What the honorable member for Parkes says is, in my opinion, quite correct. If we had to renew the loans of ,&#163;80,000,000 to-day, it might cost a very. large sum, though I do not say that it would cost &#163;18,000,000. We do not desire to be placed in any difficulty such as I have indicated, because it would be a reflection on our business ability. People would say that we Australians cannot look after our own interests ; and we ought to take care that that impression is not created. The honorable member for Parkes&#62; asked whether Commonwealth legislation had not had some effect in depreciating the value of State stocks. The other night I said that while we&#39; are passing experimental legislation of a class which does interfere with business enterprises in Australia, I believed that that legislation would do some good. If the result of that legislation is to stamp out sweating and similar evils, and give the working men a proper wage and proper surroundings, it is worth paying a little for it. </para>

                            <para>- I .am very glad to hear that. The final question  on  which I desire to touch is that o? the Tariff itself. As honorable members are aware, I was returned to this House as a pledged protectionist; and protection presents my view of the position. I desire to see Australia do its own work as far as possible. I am, and always have been, an enthusiastic Australian ; and I do not think that any nation is complete without an iron industry. That is the basis df all other industries ; and I hope to see it fairly stimulated by our legislation. Then Australia ought to be the home of woollen manufactures. Whether Australia will eventually export woollen goods I am not at present prepared to say, - but, at any rate, we ought to give our manufacturers protection sufficient to enable them to cater for our own market. The question as to the amount of that protection is one we shall have to debate when the items of the Tariff are before us ; and I do not desire to deal with it in detail now. My view, broadly, is that the Tariff Commission, having sat so long, and having so thoroughly investigated the matters submitted to them - I am now referring&#39; to the protectionist wing of the Commission - -are in a good position to judge as to the protection it is necessary to extend to any industry. In the. case of woollens they have recommended a duty of 30 per cent. As they have gone thoroughly into all the matters with which they have dealt, I feel that if no reasons are adduced for doubting -the wisdom of their findings, I shall be justified in following their recommendations. I do not wish the Minister of Trade and Customs to give the Government away in this matter, but I feel sure that in dealing with the recommendations of the Protectionist wing of the Tariff Commission., </para>

                    <para class="block"> Ministers, anticipating a good deal of trouble in carrying those recommendations, as business men left a big margin. It is very likely that that is what I should myself have done in the circumstances ; if I wished to carry a duty of 30 per cent., I should ask for a duty of 40 per cent. If I desired to sell a mob of sheep at 15s. a head, I might probably ask 16s. or 17s. per head. This is  a very common &#39; business practice, and I have no doubt that it has been followed by Ministers in framing the Tariff. I believe that if duties at about the rates recommended by the Protectionist wing of the Tariff Commission are accepted, we shall provide a sufficient measure of protection to enable our manufacturers to do our own work in Australia. Dealing with the proposed duties on tea and kerosene, I think I may say that I was one of the first to recommend that&#34; duties should be imposed on these articles and the revenue set aside to provide for old-age pensions. The idea has been considerably discussed since, and I need not detain the Committee by discussing it at length at this stage. </para>

                            <para>- Hardly, I think, and I shall tell the honorable member why. When I was in the Victorian State Parliament, it was frequently complained that old-age pensions were continually referred to as charities. I think we are all agreed that when a poor man or woman is compelled to take advantage of the provision made for old-age pensions, we should, if possible, avoid the suggestion that they have become dependent upon public charity. I suggested in the State Parliament that a small duty should be imposed on tea and kerosene for the purpose of providing an old-age pension fund. I know that in the business in which I am engaged it is the practice to provide tea and kerosene for employes. </para>

I think that in Victoria 16 persons out of every 100 who are over the age of 65 ) ears are in receipt of old-age pensions, and the other 84 would be contributing their quota by the payment of taxation on tea and kerosene to support those who have not been so fortunate in life. </para>

                            <para>- I shall conclude my remarks by saying a word on the question of the new protection. It seems to me that protection does not necessarily lead to a rise in the price of commodities. What protectionists say is that when a protective duty is imposed, the result is to retain the market for the local producer, but that, after a time, and in some cases a very short time, local competition becomes keen, and the price of the protected article is not raised to the consumer. </para>

                            <para>- As the honorable&#39; member for Maranoa is probably aware, there is at present in Australia an enormous demand for wire netting.&#39; The present demand cannot be supplied. I was informed the other day that the Australian demand for wire netting has overtaken the supply, not merely of New South Wales, but of the world. .The rise in price of the article can, therefore, be explained by the application of the law of supply and demand, and not as a &#39; necessary consequence of protection. Even if the increased price were due to the duty imposed under the new Tariff, it should be remembered that there is only one manufacturer of the article in Australia, and there is, therefore, an .absence of local competition in the industry. </para>

                        (Brisbane) &#91;3.59&#93;.- If I consulted my own inclination, I should refrain from addressing myself to the question before the Committee, because I recognise that it is in the highest degree desirable that we should get to business with the Tariff. We should do so for this reason, if for no other, that considerable loss is being incurred daily by the commercial community as a result of the dislocation of business and the natural disinclination to pay duties which, in the course of a month or two, may be reduced, since that would place those who paid the higher rates of duty now levied on various articles :at a disadvantage as compared with those paying the reduced rates, and might render the sale of the articles taken out of bond unprofitable. For those reasons, I shall .be disinclined to .prolong unnecessarily the debate. But there are one or two matters which it is due to my constituents that I should mention. I do not propose to traverse the very cogent arguments which have been addressed from this side of the Chamber to the question of the Budget and the financial position of the  Commonwealth generally - arguments which appeared to me to be strikingly conclusive from the stand-point of the speakers. I allude more especially to the speeches of the honorable members for Parramatta, Parkes, Bendigo, and Flinders. I do not propose to go over the ground which they trod, but I desire to associate myself strongly with the views which they&#39; expressed. It is somewhat difficult to understand why those views have not been more fully replied to from the Treasury bench and the Ministerial cross-benches.

In that respect the debate has been rather a surprise to me, because I cannot resist the feeling that the Government are relying upon their majority. </para>

                        I will not use that expression. Apparently the Government are relying upon the majority in the corner which constantly supports them in anything which may be brought forward, in order that they may be retained in office to carry out its behests. I propose to express a few views in regard to the Budget and the Tariff from the Queensland stand-point. I took an active part in the general election, and, so far as I was able to gather, the fiscal issue was absolutely sunk. There was no outcry for a highly protective or prohibitive Tariff. It may be aptly and tersely described as having been a contest between those who wanted to bring about &#34; Socialism in our time&#34; and those who were opposed to the enactment and realization of that principle. In view of that issue, which was the prominent feature of the elections, the fiscal question was entirely sunk. I scarcely ever referred to the fiscal question. Sometimes I found it necessary, in reply to an interjection or in explanation of an argument which I was using, to mention the fact that I was a protectionist. I am a protectionist, but I am by no means a prohibitionist. As a Queenslander, I hold that in any Tariff which may be passed we are not justified in sacrificing the primary industries for the sake of fostering those secondary industries which must necessarily be more or less exotic. That, I may say, is the stand I shall take in connexion with the details of the Tariff. At the general election we heard a great deal about the necessity for an adjustment of the anomalies which were alleged to exist in the old Tariff. But, if I can judge the opinions which have been expressed throughout Australia during the last few weeks, I venture to say that the anomalies in the new Tariff will far and away transcend those which were to be found in the old Tariff.

                    <para>Colonel FOXTON. - Yes; it is nearly as good as Mesopotamia for some purposes. Before dealing with the Tariff, let me state the view which  I  &#39;take of the financial statement. The most serious and disquieting feature which has been presented during the debate has been the light and airy way in which the Treasurer has intimated that it is absolutely impossible to continue the operation of the Braddon section. Upon the continuance of that section, or the substitution of a provision which will be equally beneficial to the States, will really depend the credit, and  I  might almost say the solvency, of the States. The fourth portion of the Customs and Excise revenue which the Commonwealth is entitled to retain is practically now exhausted. In only one year has Queensland received more than its three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue, and this year  I  understand that the amount to be received by that State will be considerably below the average amount which it has received, and which has been very considerably below the three-fourths portion. This is a very serious matter to the various Treasurers, especially the Treasurers of States which, unlike Victoria and New South Wales, are unable to manage with the reduced payments.  I  have had personal experience of the very great difficulty in which State Treasurers are placed when they find that the actual receipts from the Commonwealth are below the amounts which they had reasonable justification for expecting. Although the Treasurer says that it will be impossible to continue the operation of the Braddon section, still he does not say, nor has any Minister since risen to explain, what financial system, as between the States and the Commonwealth, is to take the place of that which was solemnly agreed upon as part of the compact when the Constitution Bill was accepted. </para>

                        No, we want to know. Ever since this debate was initiated I have been expecting that the request preferred by the honorable  member for Flinders would have been acceded to, and that the Committee . would have been informed of what it is proposed to substitute for the arrangement which, the right honorable member for Swan explained the other day, was made the basis of the understanding which he, on behalf of the Commonwealth, and with the full sanction of the Prime. Minister, entered into with the States Premiers at the Conference in Brisbane. That arrangement was practically agreed to by the whole of the States.

During his temporary retirement, a new proposal has been sprung upon the House by the Acting Prime Minister, who declares that the arrangement which was entered into with the States Premiers at Brisbane cannot be carried out, and that the continuation of the Braddon section is impossible. The discontinuance of that section would be a very serious matter for the States. </para>

                        As I have already indicated, the expenditure forecast in the Budget will- with the exception of about &#163;100,000 - absorb the whole of the one-fourth share of the Customs and Excise revenue which the Commonwealth is constitutionally entitled to retain. Yet, as part of the Government policy, other large expenditures are contemplated in connexion with measures which certain sanguine individuals expect to see carried during the current session. Where is the money to cover this expenditure to come from? If it is intended that the additional revenue which will be required by the Commonwealth - perhaps not this year, but certainly next year, and in increasing amounts during the following years - shall be raised by direct taxation, the dissatisfaction which undoubtedly exists throughout Australia will be intensified to such a degree that Nemesis will certainly overtake those political parties who force such a state of things upon the country.

                        - The question of the Minister of Trade and Customs is a very pertinent one, but the answer to it is, that whenever an attempt has been made to adjust matters between the States and the Commonwealth, friction has unfortunately arisen. As year succeeds year, instead of getting nearer to a solution of these difficulties, we are apparently getting further away from their settlement.

At the present time, there is a greater gulf to bridge between the States and the Commonwealth in regard to the adjustment of their financial relations than existed last year. If effect is to be given to the ideas of the Acting Prime Minister - if the Braddon section is to be discontinued, and if we are not to substitute for it an arrangement upon similar lines- </para>

The public will be the best judges. Possibly, I am not a perfectly competent judge, being, to some extent, a partisan ; but the honorable member who interjects, being also a partisan, is equally disqualified from forming an impartial opinion upon the point. The whole intention of the Government at this juncture appears to be to enter upon a policy of exasperation in regard to the States. </para>

                        Exactly. If any honorable member - even the honorable member who is so persistently interrupting me - were to give expression to certain views inimical to the States, it would not concern me very much. I should not regard it as a matter of vital consequence. But when such views are expressed by the acting head of the Government, supported by a majority in this House, and when he proposes deliberately to undermine the Constitution-

I am not with him there, but the fact that he talks in that way indicates the feeling entertained against those who are responsible for these encroachments and aggressions on the part of the Commonwealth. It must not be thought that the people who are expressing this dissatisfaction, and some of whom are talking about secession are anti-Federalists, or that they are opposed to the maintenance of the Commonwealth. That is not so. Some men who are taking a prominent part in the movement&#34; of execration against the Commonwealth - that is not too strong a term - are leaders of political thought in the various States. Many of them are men who have hitherto held aloof from the expression of these opinions in public. They were formerly as strong Federalists as any member of this House. </para>

I have nothing to say against the Sugar Bounty Act in so far as it affects&#39; the question of policy, but it is a bald legal question whether or &#39; not&#39; &#39; this Parliament has not displayed a tendency to overstep the bounds which should properly&#39; divide its functions from those of the States: </para>

                        - Then the honorable member has misapprehended my statement. What I say is that the general tendency of this Parliament to encroach upon the functions of the States is a cause of complaint. Whilst this Parliament in its wisdom thought fit to give a bounty to growers of sugar employing whitelabour,it likewise thought fit. to levy upon them an excise of &#163;1 per ton in excess of the amount of the bounty. There was nothing very generous about that action. I was not referring to the measure in question as constituting a source of grievance On the part of, Queensland, but I wished to, emphasize the point that the general tendency of this Parliament&#39;s encroach upon the functions of the States has given rise to the dissatisfaction now so prevalent:

                        It is idle for the honorable member to trv to wriggle out of  his statement. If the Minister of Trade and Customs desired to reply to the arguments advanced from this side of the House why has he not done so? Why has he not opened his mouth during this debate except to interject, and to interrupt other honorable members ? After the  deputy  leader of the Opposition had spoken, the Minister of Trade and Customs should have replied. Why has he sat at the table and merely tried to interrupt those who attack the Government ?

                        It is idle for the honorable member to suggest that I am losing my temper. It would take much more than what has occurred to cause me to do so. But one strongly resents the action of a Minister who sits at the table e- &#39; continuously  interrupting, and who does not see fit to rise and say one word in defence of the Budget or the Tariff proposals of the Government.

                    <para>Colonel FOXTON.- Quite so. He appears to be relying simply upon the force of numbers. It was hoped that Federation would remove many of the difficulties which were constantly arising between the States. To a certain extent it has done so; but at the same time it has created one more authority, and so opened a new field for friction, jealousy, and misunderstanding. I have not the least doubt that, although some of the States may not be entirely blameless in regard to the friction and misunderstanding which have arisen between them and the Commonwealth, the various Federal Governments have been principally &#39;responsible for the trouble. It must be borne in mind that the creation of the Commonwealth was a departure from the <inline font-style="italic">status quo.</inline> It behoved every Com mon wealth Government to be extremely careful not to do anything that would create even the suspicion of a desire on their part to encroach upon the functions of the States. Their actions could have been so restrained, but unfortunately the States, almost without exception, have imbibed the opinion - and the great body of the public do not imbibe an opinion without some justification for it - that there is on the part of the Commonwealth a constant endeavour to encroach upon the functions of the States. </para>

                        - I shall not repeat the statement for the sake of the honorable gentleman. It must be borne in mind that the electors in those constituencies which are charged with being. anti-Federal are also the electors of members of this House. If that feeling of dissatisfaction exists among them, it will find expression eventually in the return of members to this Parliament.

                    <para>Colonel FOXTON. - I can point to many who do not come within that description, and who are at the head of affairs in the States. Not only are those electors the constituents of members of this House, but the States members and States Governments, who are taking a leading part in this agitation, are in closer touch with them than are the members of this House, for several very good reasons. In the first place,, in every State except Victoria, where practically the same conditions exist with regard to both State and Federal members, the members of this House are, during a large period of the session, at a very much greater distance from their electors than are the members of States  Houses. They  are for lengthy periods dissociated from their electors except upon those matters which form the subjects of correspondence. The State member is in much closer touch with the people on that account. He is also in much closer touch with the individual elector, because his electorate is a very much smaller one, and, speaking generally, he knows practically every man in it, or something about him. That is not the cass in regard to the very much more extended electorates represented by members of this House. Lastly, and principally - and this applies especially to the States Governments, as distinguished from the Government of the Commonwealth - States members and States Governments, are in very much closer touch with the electors than are Commonwealth members and the Commonwealth &#39; Government, because there are only a few subjects upon which the Commonwealth Parliament can legislate, or which can be administered by the Commonwealth Government, affecting the individual elector. Shortly* put, they are the Post Office Department, Defence Department, and the Customs House. Apart from those, every other Federal power expressed within the thirty-nine articles of section 51 of the Constitution is indirect, and almost impalpable in its operation as regards the individual elector. On the other hand, the functions performed by the State member for his constituency comprise the thousand and one matters which are closely interwoven with the daily life of the people. These are a few of them, which I have jotted down - schools and education generally, land, mines and the Mining Departments, railways, police protection, public works, administration of justice, local government and the allied branches of administration, the Agricultural Department, rabbit and marsupial legislation, and numberless other items. All these bring the State member in constant touch with his electors. Honorable members may depend upon it that, if the States Parliaments, Governments, and electors are crying out against the Commonwealth, there is something in it, and that a reflex of that opinion will be ultimately found in this House. </para>

                        It was applied to those who took part in the Premiers&#39; Conferences. The .statement was to the effect that&#39; the Conferences were anti-Federal. &#34;Traitors&#34; is a stronger word than was used, -I admit; &#34;but I cannot at this moment recall it, but it was one bearing much, the same meaning. Those Conferences have been held for the purpose of adjusting matters between the States and the Commonwealth, and between the States themselves, and for resisting what the States Legislatures and Governments regarded as. encroachments by the Commonwealth upon States functions. I am in doubt myself whether it cannot be said that the mere fact that there has been a necessity for such Conferences indicates that there is something wanting in our Constitution. It is a remarkable fact that after nearly forty years of Federation in Canada, the first Premiers&#39; . Conference which has been held in that country was held early this year. At a dinner tendered to the delegates,

                        Laurier were in Australia, and cognizant of all that takes place at Premiers&#39; Conferences in this part of the world, and of the necessity that exists for them, I wonder what he would say about our Constitution?

                        - We have been waiting to see. When the Acting Prime Minister was &#39;not present in the chamber, I said we had been waiting for a member of the Government, or some of their  supporters, to reply to statements -made from, this side, but that the. Government had not said a word except by way of interjection. Qf course, in making that remark, I except the Acting Prime Minister, who was compelled to say something when he introduced the Tariff. &#39; Otherwise, no member of the Government has thought fit to reply to the speeches which have been made by pro,minent members on this side; on the contrary, honorable members opposite have, contented themselves, as the Acting Prime Minister is now doing, by interjecting and interrupting honorable members on this side.

The Tariff provides protection for even remote possibilities in the way of secondary industries, while primary&#39; industries, which have been shown to be natural to the country, are left severely alone, or are not -given anything like the same degree of protection. </para>

                    <para>Colonel FOXTON.- Yes, that is quite correct. Some of the secondary industries which I have spoken of as remotely possible will, as compared with the &#34;great primary industries, employ an infinitesimal .number of artisans. Yet those engaged in the primary industries are to be called upon to pay extra duties, until, at all events, these small secondary industries are established. That, in my opinion, is not a fair way in which to approach the question ; but the method may be accounted for by the reason indicated in a speech, made by the Acting Prime Minister ;i  Wagga the other day, in which he said - </para>

Although reference has already been made to the work of the Commission, I do not think that the services of the members have received adequate recognition at our hands. In spite of the time spent by the Commission in preparing their recommendations, the Tariff was delayed from week to week, and even month to month, after the House met, in order that, as we were told, details might be completed. And, even now, the Acting Prime Minister, according to the quotation I have read, says that experts have been called in for the purpose. of adjusting the Tariff on proper lines. </para>

In my opinion, those experts ought to have been called in long ago if the testimony of the experts examined by the Tariff Commission was held to be insufficient.

                        - What is done elsewhere with regard to Tariffs?. The present Tariff appears to have been prepared in a haphazard way, and placed on the table in a haphazard way, judging by. the speech of the Acting Prime Minister at Wagga&#39;; indeed, it seems to  have been .laid on the table in order that it might be formulated by the House. This is a most extraordinary attitude for the Minister in charge of it to take up. The revision referred to should have been carried out beforehand for the reason that in the meantime whatever anomalies there may be in the Tariff must be the cause of very great loss to individuals, and it might almost be said to sections in the community, during the whole of the time that the duties are under consideration by Parliament.

                        Yes, but _ there would have been fewer anomalies in the Tariff if the experts who are being called in now had been called in before. They need not have been informed of the decisions which would be arrived at from their evidence any more than the witnesses who gave evidence before the Tariff Commission were informed of what the reports of the Commission would be. Had the evidence of the experts been read by the Government together with the reports and evidence submitted by the Tariff Commission, the Tariff might have been submitted in a definite form, for which the Government could make themselves responsible. Apparently that course has not been followed. Another expression made use of by the Prime Minister was that the Tariff &#34;should be made palatable to all classes of the community.&#34; That is a statement with which every one can agree. I do not know whether the Government are satisfied that all classes of the community regard this Tariff as palatable. I should regard the experience of the Minister of Defence at the Agricultural Show the other day as an indication that he was. in the presence of a very large number of representative men who did not find it at all palatable. Notwithstanding the comfort which I have no doubt the Acting Prime Minister will be able to find in the telegrams he has received from such important centres of population as&#39; Moojebing and Maningamarley,  not to speak of Sacramento City, California, the honorable gentleman must be satisfied in his own mind that the dictum of the Prime Minister that the Tariff should be palatable to all classes of the community has not been given effect in its integrity.

                        Undoubtedly it is. I take the case of bicycle frames, which I quoted to the Minister of Trade and Customs the other day. A thousand bicycle frames were or will be reshipped from this country after being landed, as the result of the duty imposed on these articles bv this Tariff.

                    <para>Colonel FOXTON- It was not a question of importing those goods from elsewhere; they were actually here, and were sent back to America or England, whence they came, because it would not pay to land them, since the duty imposed is more than twice the profit that could have been made on the goods duty paid. Another firm wrote to me saying that it was impossible for them to pay the duty imposed on a shipment of chairs, which they landed, and which amounted to about 407 per cent. </para>

                        The persons to whom the chairs to which I have referred were consigned actually requested the officer of the Customs Department to burn or destroy them on the wharf, as they would prefer to .see them burnt to having to go to the expense of shipping them back whence they came. Is not that an example of prohibition ? Other instances of the kind can be referred to later on.

Apart from the view of my honorable friends on this side who are free-traders, it must be admitted that the policy practically, adopted by the Commonwealth is a wise one, because far greater advantages are to be derived from the operation of a protective policy over the whole area of the Commonwealth than could have been derived from the adoption of such a policy in any one of the States.

                    <para>Colonel FOXTON.- The wider the area covered by a protective Tariff the greater the benefit to be derived from it, since it means a wider market, and a wider field and greater variety of production. Even free-traders must be satisfied that this is so, because the larger area allows for a larger degree of inter-State freetrade. It is the free interchange of commodities between the States of the United States of America that has made that country what it is. In just the same way, and just as the scope of the market is widened, and the variety of products which &#39; are the result of &#39;protection in the widened area are increased, the question of adjusting the duties equitably is made more complex. It is in. this connexion that I think the Government have failed to. rise to the occasion in the preparation of this Tariff. In some instances I can quote, the raw material is taxed1 at a higher rate than the finished product. I need not go into details at this stage. </para>

                        - There is evidence ot a degree of carelessness in the preparation of the Tariff when such items can be referred to. If duties of this character were carried, and demands were made for still higher protection amounting to absolute prohibition, the Commonwealth would find itself in the interesting position described by some one who, when asked to explain the enormous prosperity which existed in a particular community, said that it was due to the fact that they took in one another&#39;s washing. We cannot afford to agree to prohibition. So far as I can see, it is opposed to all true principles of finance. We must have interchange with other countries. We have our wool, minerals, and other valuable products to offer to other countries, and we must get something from those countries in return.  A.  clear adjustment of the protective duties at a rate which will be sufficient to encourage production, but not entirely to prevent competition from outside, should be the

                    <para>Colonel FOXTON.- Before a man can enter he has to show that he is not a pauper, and is not likely to become a charge upon the country. The number of immigrants to the United States shows that the restrictions which have been imposed since that time are less than those which obtain here. When the Minister interjected I was speaking of a time anterior to the imposition of those restrictions. The great prosperity which has attended the policy of protection in the United States has been due to the fact that there has always been an immense stream of labour coming in to meet any possible demand which an industry might make as a result of its development under a protective Tariff. </para>

                    <para>Colonel FOXTON. - Some industries are calling out for labour now, but cannot get it. When we have a prohibitive Tariff what will happen? People will be paying an unnecessarily high price for the protection which an industry is getting. I forget the exact amount which a man has to show that he possesses before he can enter the United States, but I am inclined to think&#34; that it is  20  dollars. Suppose, however, for the sake of my argument, that it is  100  dollars. </para>

Whether a man be under contract or not, I hold that no white man, no man of European extraction, should be excluded from our shores if he. can show that he has a little money with which to start his new life, that he is not suffering from a disease which is likely to be a menace to the population, and is of good character. It will be necessary to go as far as that if, in adopting a high protective Tariff, we attempt to increase largely our industries. </para>

                        Yes, and Queensland was never so prosperous as she was then, with a protective Tariff. That brings me to a point to which I have to refer, and I am very glad that the Postmaster-General is present. When the honorable member for Illawarra was commenting upon the balance-sheet and general prosperity of the Denton Hat Mills Company under the old Tariff, and indicating that there is no necessity for the increased protection which obtains under the new Tariff, I interjected a remark.

                        I hope that the honorable member will not try to lead me off my track. I entered the chamber as the honorable member for Illawarra made that reference to the Denton Hat Mills Company. I interjected that they were unable to supply orders as they got them, and the &#39; Postmaster-General interjected that my statement was absolutely incorrect.

I took down exactly what he told me; He informed me that he had called at the office of the mills, the. manager of which had promised to supply him with a range of samples in a week or ten days. After waiting a. month he wrote.&#39; asking when he might expect the samples, to which communication a reply was received, stating that the mills were so full of orders and hatmakers were so scarce, that they could &#39; not deliver before eight months or so. He then wrote, saying that he would be content to await his turn with other houses, even to the extent of eight months. A reply , was forthcoming that the orders which the mills then had on hand were as much as they could cope with for many months, and that they were regretfully compelled, upon that ground, to decline any further orders. </para>

                    <para>We were duly favoured with your letter of February 26th.

                    <para>Whilst we have ample accommodation and power at the factory to deal with a largely increased turnover, the difficulty is that the supply of labour in certain branches of the trade is limited, and having already a large <inline font-style="italic">clientele</inline> in the various States we naturally study first those who have done a satisfactory business with us for years. </para>
                    <para>The orders which we have now on hand are fully as much as we can cope with for many months, exclusive of the repeat orders that are regularly arriving, so that, much as we regret it, we are compelled on this ground to pass your firm, as were we to encourage you to send us orders we fear our inability to deliver to time, which would be a disappointment to you, as well as unsatisfactory to ourselves. </para>
                    <para class="block">That is the company&#39;s explanation of why they refused to supply his order. Lest another inference may be drawn from it, I may mention that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kirkland</inline> informs me that he told the people connected with the mills that he was prepared to pay cash on delivery. I have, I think, established the truth of my statement in reply to the Postmaster-General. I have supplied hint with that proof which he promised to obtain for me. Passing away from this subject, I desire to point out that Queensland has had a considerable experience in connexion with immigration. The result of that experience goes to show that, as a general rule, it is not practicable to put large numbers of men from the older countries of Europe upon the lands of Australia - certainly not upon lands so far north as Queensland - immediately upon their arrival, even although they may be possessed of farming experience. It takes them some years to become accustomed to their new conditions, and my own opinion! is that they should be gradually drafted to the land from industries which are overcrowded. </para>

                        - I think not at first.. Even those immigrants who selected land in Queensland for 2s. 6d. an acre, and who had five years within which to pay it, had: in many instances spent practically the best part of their life-time before they got their heads above water, from a financial stand-point. They were compelled . to struggle for fifteen or twenty years, and during a large portion of that time they had to live upon pumpkins and wallaby - upon the roughest kind of fare - and&#39; were provided with covering which was very little better than that enjoyed by the aborigines. These immigrants were principally Germans. It is true that their pluck and stamina pulled them through, but, nevertheless, their experience shows that it takes a generation to establish a family under such conditions. In my judgment, it is preferable to allow men to settle upon the land after they have acquired a certain amount of colonial experience, either as farm hands or in some other walk of life. In Queensland to-day we want labour, and cannot secure it. During the course of this debate it has been suggested that both the Excise and the bounty payable in respect of the production of sugar should be abolished, and that a protective- duty should be substituted for them. There are many persons in Queensland who think- that the adoption of such a course would be an excellent thing. Others hold a different opinion, because, although they would then be at liberty to employ coloured labour to any extent that they chose, they argue that it is now too late for the Commonwealth to place the Queensland sugar-growers upon the footing which they occupied a few years ago, seeing that thousands of their skilled coloured labourers have been deported. Unless these kanakas were re-introduced, it would be impossible to put the Queensland planter upon the footing that he formerly occupied in regard to coloured labour. To supply the places of thousands of kanakas who have been deported, a few white men, comparatively speaking, have drifted north, and are doing well. Undoubtedly white men can do the work, though not all white men are fit for it. It takes a good strong man to do the work required of him in the tropical portions of Queensland, but still there are men who can do it, and it is worth while to pay good wages to those who are fit for it.

                    <para>Colonel FOXTON- In the Mossman district. The farmers last year had smaller returns than they had in the previous year. Not only has the shortage of labour had an injurious effect upon the sugar industry, but men have gone from the south of Australia, and particularly from&#39; southern Queensland, to the sugar districts, attracted by the high wages, and have consequently decreased the labour supply elsewhere. This exodus has partially depleted the Darling Downs of its labour. It was&#62; mentioned the other day by the representative of one of the Darling Downs constituencies in the State Parliament, that the labour difficulty there was a serious one. He stated that the next harvest on the Darling Downs would be attended with serious difficulties on account of a scarcity of labour, owing to the fact that large numbers of men had gone to work in the. sugar industry. So that not only is the supply of labour for the sugar industry insufficient, but that insufficiency is having an injurious effect on other districts. </para>

                    <para>Colonel FOXTON.- That may be so in the south, but it is not so in the north, unless as the result of good seasons. The fact that 30,000 tons of cane were left standing is the strongest proof honorable members can have of the condition of the industry. A group of farmers connected with a Central . Mill would not have allowed 30,000 tons of cane to remain unharvested without good cause. </para>

But when any practical proposal is made, what do we find? We have protests from deputations against men being introduced to supply the wants of the sugar industry. The honorable member for Herbert, whose name has just been mentioned, stated that he could get 500 men in Melbourne who were willing to go and work in Queensland. There may have been a few men who were willing to go, but how many of the 500 to whom the honorable member referred were not only unemployed, but unemployable, even in the south?&#39;

                        - The honorable member forgets that efforts to secure labour had to be made some months in advance. The men were not wanted at once. It was a very easy thing for the honorable member for Herbert to trot out the fact that 500 men were ready to go when there was no work for them to do. They were wanted at harvest time. Where are those men now ? There is; plenty of work for them, and will be for the next six months. Are . they ready to go now, or were the 500 mythical ?

                    <para>Colonel FOXTON.- Undoubtedly there is. It is, however, a fact that opposition to an immigration policy exists below the surface. On the surface some honorable members are entirely in favour of immigration, but whenever an effort is made&#39; to introduce labour, there is on their part an attempt either to prevent it or to throw cold water on the project. </para>

                    <para>Colonel FOXTON. - That is so. Surely since we have in most of the States Wages Boards established, or about to be established, the introduction of labour could not be attended with any danger to the labourers already here. To suggest that a certain man who is introduced on a particular day is going to compete with a certain man already engaged in a certain: industry at that particular time is to take: a short-sighted view of the situation. The. immigration into the United States last year totalled, I think, 1,050,000, and I saw the other day a statement that these immigrants carried with them an average of&#163;500 per head. We know, of course, that a very large number had in their possession nothing like that sum of money. </para>

                    <para>Colonel FOXTON.- But other immigrants who came out by different vessels during the same year would go to make up the average. At all events, the figures I have quoted show, even though greatly over-estimated or&#39; exaggerated, that if we) like the United States of America, had an almost unrestricted stream of immigration - if we welcomed men from all parts to our shores- we should&#34; have people coming here with- capital to give employment to the additional labour so obtained. If the  actual amount per head were only one-tenth of that I have mentioned, and, personally, I should think that would be much nearer the mark, it would mean that in one year no less a sum than &#163;50,000,000 sterling was introduced by immigrants into that&#34; country.  1  confess that I quote these figures with some degree of diffidence, since I have not been able to verify them from official documents, but they constitute a remarkable object lesson to us. Canada is in the same happy position, for last year she had,&#39; I think, over 200,000 immigrants, whilst in ten years the population of the Argentine by immigration alone has increased by no less than 1,000,000. </para>

No doubt many whose capital was included in the calculation would not be pleased to be described as immigrants; there may have been a millionaire or two among the number. Quite possibly the immigrants may have included manufacturers or others in a large way of business, who were transferring their operations and their capital from the old world to the new, with the object of carrying on their industry where adequate labour was available. A full supply of labour can be obtained only by a practically unrestricted, even though properly safeguarded, system of immigration. </para>

                        That is so. As I have said, with the creation of Wages Boards there should be no dread of the advent of more workers to Australia. Immediately these newcomers land they practically create wealth. They may for the time being come into competition with a few others, but in the long run every one will benefit by their coming here. The moment an immigrant lands he begins to employ some one, if it be only a carter to carry his baggage from the steamer to his lodgings. Then he has to pay for his lodgings, and so indirectly gives employment to others. A large stream of immigrants, bringing, some of them, much money, and others very little, means a constant supply of labour, which will always induce the investment of capital. To attempt to prevent the introduction of desirable immigrants would be to strangle industries, and so to render them unable to satisfy the demands expected to be made upon them under the new Tariff. Coming to the scheme of new protection which has been suggested, I fail to see that it would work successfully. We all know what has been the result of the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act, passed last year. No one will say that it has been a success. As a matter of fact, it is not being administered. It is almost impossible, I should imagine, to administer it with the machinery at the disposal of the Government. It is being carried out by the Department of Trade and Customs, but the agricultural implements to which it relates are being manufactured throughout the interior of the Commonwealth, in many cases, where no Excise officers are to be found. They are being made in many small establishments, but, in the aggregate, a very considerable number of these implements are being manufactured far from the seaboard. In reply to questions put to the Minister, I have ascertained that no record is kept of those who are manufacturing these implements. Every maker of them ought to be paying the Excise duty of 12&#189; per cent, imposed under the Act, unless he has actually proved to the Department that he is paying the standard rate of wages. No attempt, however, has been made, so far as I know, to collect that duty. The only possible way of satisfactorily carrying out such&#39; a scheme is that adopted in connexion with the sugar industry. In other words, every manufacturer of agricultural implements dealt with by the Act should be called upon to pay the Excise duty, and the Excise so paid - or the greater part of it, as in connexion with the sugar industry - should be returned by way of bounty to those who comply with the conditions as to labour.

                    <para>Colonel FOXTON. - It is difficult to suggest a remedy. The moment we ignore the operation of the law of supply and demand we are faced with difficulties,, and, apparently, the more we attempt to legislate with a view of overcoming that difficulty the greater are the obstacles that confront us as a result of that further legislation. I have been somewhat puzzled with one aspect of the sugar bounties question. The estimated revenue from Excise for 1907-8 .at <inline font-style="italic">&#163;4</inline> a ton is ,&#163;746,000. That is payable on all sugar produced, so that the estimated yield from the sugar harvest, whether produced by black or white labour, is, presumably, 186,500 tons. Of the estimated revenue of &#163;746,000, one quarter, or &#163;186,500, is retained by the Commonwealth, and three-fourths, or &#163;559,500, is returned to States. That, however, is by the way. It is estimated that a total sum of ,&#163;573,000 will be disbursed as bounty for the year 1907-8. The bounty is at the rate of /&#91;$ per ton, and, therefore, presumably will be paid on a total production of 191,000 tons, or 4,500 tons in excess of the whole product on which it is estimated that Excise will- be paid. I cannot understand the discrepancy. The question of whether the sugar is grown by black or white labour does not explain it. The bounty is payable only on &#34; white-grown &#34; sugar. </para>

                    <para>Colonel FOXTON.- It will be of value to those who take an interest in the sugar industry. Although I have criticised the principle which appears to underlie the Tariff as submitted to this Committee, and although I am opposed to anything in the nature of prohibition, I shall certainly do my best to assist in framing a Tariff which will give a fair measure of protection to secondary or manufacturing industries, so long as the primary industries, which are those in which the State from which I come is- more particularly interested, are not hampered. </para>

                    <para>Colonel FOXTON.- Certainly ; I shall give consideration to all primary industries. I said that my own State is particularly interested in the encouragement of those primary industries, and must be so for many years to come. I speak of the industries which have relation to production from the land through agriculture, pastoral pursuits, and mining. As an indication of what perhaps would be called an anomaly in the Tariff, and therefore capable of easy correction, I may mention that not only are the tanners in Queensland, as a body, opposed to the proposed duty on leather, but so also are the boot and shoe makers. They have met together and agreed to joint resolutions condemning the Tariff as it stands. Too much protection has been given to the tanners, and they recognise that the proposed duties will practically stifle the bootmaking industry in Queensland, unless the duty on boots is further raised. There are many such anomalies. </para>

                        <para>.- When first Federation was advocated, I understood that it was to be in the interests of all Australia, but in the information received from all parts of the Continent within the last few weeks we have evidence that people are very much dissatisfied. I trust that honorable members, in dealing with the Tariff and other proposals brought before us, will endeavour to create a better feeling on the part of the people towards Federation. There is no doubt that the union was intended to promote the interests of Australia ; but. from what I have seen here, I think we are really legislating for the good of Melbourne and Sydney. No doubt these are two large and important cities, but we must not forget that the welfare of Australia, as a whole,, is of paramount importance. One would think, sometimes, from hearing debates in this House, that Melbourne and Sydney were in no way dependent on the country. But we must all acknowledge that the people of the towns feel a drought just as much and as quickly as do the people in the country - that if the country is not prosperous the towns cannot be prosperous. As a matter of fact, we, in Australia, are all dependent on our primary industries. I am a protectionist, but I have never advocated, and never shall advocate, any legislation which would have the effect of in any way injuring our primary industries, because I fail to see how any country can be prosperous where the legislation is prejudicial to what is really the basis of our wealth. Of course, as a protectionist, I believe in the establishment of industries, and shall always be found voting in favour of legislation which has that object. No one can saiy that Australia requires more than reasonable protection ; and when I use the word &#34; reasonable,&#34; I mean protection that will not injure the primary industries. </para>

                            <para>- Until we have power, by legislation, to increase the value of our wool, wheat, flour, meat, butter, and also our gold, silver, lead, copper, tin, and other minerals, which we send for sale in the markets of the world, we cannot afford to harass the producers of those commodities. To harass those producers means to injure our own country, and pettifogging legislation, which keeps the community in such a state of uncertainty that people do not really know what to expect next, is not, and cannot be, in the best interests of Australia. We, in the Opposition corner, have been accused of depreciating Australia; but I have never heard one word here to justify such an accusation. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for West Sydney did so on several occasions. I thought the question might be asked, and I made a note of the fact. I know too much of Australia to think of depreciating the country in any way. We have the most magnificent resources of any country in the world; these exist not only in one direction, but in many. There  is gold in all the States, especially in Western Australia, in the northwest of which large gold and tin mining areas are being opened up in districts which were little thought of a few years ago. The honorable member for Coolgardie, in whose electorate these areas are, will bear me out in my statement. Then, I suppose, there is no country in the world with such magnificent iron ore deposits as lie untouched in Australia. I hear that on the north-west coast of Western Australia there is a huge deposit. We all know of the deposits in Tasmania, of the Iron Knob in South Australia, and of similar wealth in New South Wales. Up to &#39;the present, little or nothing has been done to develop those valuable deposits; but I hope that some action will be taken before long. I suppose that Australia produces the best wool in the world ; and taking them altogether we should be proud of its vast resources. So far from depreciating Australia, I am so satisfied with it, after a residence of nearly thirty years, that I am not likely to move on the chance of finding a better country. We require chiefly men. of energy and pluck, and the more we leave our primary producers alone, the more prosperous they will be. </para>

                            <para>- I shall deal with Central Australia. When we consider that the. water that flows out of Australia at Goolwa flows from North Queensland over, I suppose, the greatest distance that water can flow in Australia, we can realize the huge areas which, though now only sheep runs, might be irrigated, and thus afford employment to thousands of people. The production of wheat and other cereals is a big industry, which is yet only in its infancy, for, in my opinion, cereals can be grown in huge areas where at present there is an idea that their cultivation is impossible. In Western Australia, only ten years ago, wheat was being grown as far east as Northam; but I can assure honorable members that now there are splendid crops 100 miles nearer the gold-fields- </para>

                            <para>- Wheat can be seen growing at Kalgoorlie as well as anywhere else. Possibly the largest area in Australia of land suitable for wheat-growing is to be found in Western Australia. At the present time, in that State, light railways for the development of the country are being constructed, and I feel quite certain that it will yet be one of the largest wheat-producing States in the Commonwealth. I speak from actual knowledge of the country, and not of what I have been told, or of what I have read. I was. at Broken Hill in the early days, and at Kalgoorlie shortly after it was discovered, and I have seen the more recently discovered mineral deposits to which I have already referred. Settlement in Australia must experience the phases through which it passes in other countries, and it cannot be forced. First of all, the land is devoted to the rearing of sheep and cattle, then, as the country becomes more settled, various forms of agriculture are developed, and, as population increases, we must go in for manufactures to provide employment for our people. Honorable members will admit that it is in the best interests of the Commonwealth that as much of our land as possible should be utilized, and that as many of our people as possible should be engaged in production from the land. We do not want people to flock to the towns in any greater number than we can possibly help. Personally, I should like to see one-half of the people who are now living in the towns of the Commonwealth scattered over lands that are not being utilized. </para>

                            <para>- I certainly should, and if I could bring it about I believe I should be returned unopposed at the next election. We have obtained peaceful possession of Australia. Great Britain has been our protector against foreign invasion, and we have been free from wars with native tribes. The early settlers of New Zealand, of America, and of South Africa had to fight the native inhabitants of those countries in order to hold them. Millions of money were spent, and hundreds of thousands of lives were lost, in the struggle to hold those countries. The people settling them had to borrow money to be spent in defence, for which they had nothing to show but a number of widows, orphans, and cripples. They could ill afford to lose the men or the money, but they were compelled to lose both in order to hold the country. We have been told by honorable members in the Labour corner that in Australia we are in an awful position because we owe so much money. I cannot agree with that contention. I do not believe that we are in any way distressed by the amount of money we owe. It must not be forgotten that we have magnificent assets to represent the money we have borrowed. I am not afraid, if others are, and I can see nothing alarming in the borrowing of so much money when we have it represented by such assets as we possess in Australia. As money accumulates, it must be used, and it is important only that it should be used productively. Australia could not be developed without the expenditure of a great deal of money. I remind honorable members that the man who can use money, and pay good interest for its use, is of as much benefit to the man who has money to invest as is the man who has money to the man who requires it for the purpose of starting an  industry. The  total debt of Australia in 1906 amounted to &#163;243,473,785. That is a very large sum, but how is it invested? In the items of railways and telegraphs alone we have in Australia a magnificent asset, representing &#163;150,000,000. Very few countries in the world own their railway and telegraph systems. The Government of Great Britain, for instance, does not own the railway systems of the country. I suppose these are among the finest assets a country can possess. The other &#163;100,000,000 of our total debt is represented by works con.structed for water supply, sewerage, harbor and river improvements, lighthouses, docks, bridges, roads, defence works, schools, and other public buildings, and assistance given to immigration. When we consider the area of Australia, the extent of our seaboard, and the number of our harbors and rivers, it must be admitted that &#163;100,000,000 is not much to owe when it is set against the work which has been done by the expenditure of that money. In all the circumstances, it is ridiculous for honorable members to contend that the debt of Australia is any serious burden on the country. The money &#34; .we have borrowed has riot been spent in war, it has not been blown away in ammunition., or expended upon obsolete war material. The money &#39; borrowed by the various States has been spent honestly and wisely by people who were legislating before we appeared on the scene, and every penny we owe is represented by something done. I believe that the money borrowed by Australia has been as well spent as money borrowed by any country in the world. </para>

                            <para>- The borrowing of such a sum would not be a matter of very much consequence if we had a sufficient population. We must hold Australia for our own people, and open it up as it should be opened up. What we require to do is to enact legislation which will give people confidence to invest in Australia the money they make in this country. Some people speak as though money spent on public works were lost to the people of the country, but it is not so. If money does not leave our shores our people have it still. What we should complain of is the sending of money from Australia to purchase things which we can make here. When we have a railway to build half the money required for its construction is sent from Australia, or is kept in the old country, &#34;to pay for rails, fastenings, and other materials&#34; required, which are not made in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- We send goods to England, and should receive money for them. If we were making steel rails and ether railway material with Australian money in Australia,, we should retain the money now sent abroad for that material, and we should be the richer by that amount, plus the value of the material manufactured in the country. If the people&#39;s savings are invested in the establishment of local industries. Australia generally must be benefited. If their surplus cash were used to develop Australia, it would not increase our debt, and, at the same time, it would be a good investment. If we could only teach Australians to have confidence in their country, and, instead of locking up their money, or not knowing what to do with it- </para>

It is most important that the iron industry should be established here, with Australian money. If Australians were to invest &#163;1,000,000 to-morrow in the iron industry, it would be quite safe. </para>

                            <para>- If the Government establish a prohibitive Tariff, they will be taking the money out of the people&#39;s pockets instead of borrowing from them and paying interest. We must keep the gold in the country. I want steel rails, fencing wire, and everything which can be made from native iron ores to be made here. I presume that if it is to be used, in the future Northern Australia must be opened up by means of steel rails, steel sleepers, and steel bridges. If wooden materials were used for that purpose it would be eaten by white ants as fast as it could be laid, and in twenty years there would be no asset left for the people. But if we converted our iron deposits into steel rails, and constructed railways, we should develop the country, and leave an asset for posterity. The money would be paid in wages, but it would circulate through other channels. </para>

Surely the Government is not afraid to pay a little interest for the use of the money !

                            <para>- With regard to the establishment of industries in Australia, I can cite a little history to prove that it is necessary to exercise great care. It is of no use to spoon-feed or to ladle gold out of the Treasury to an industry, and imagine that it can be established by that method. Some years ago Fulton&#39;s foundry, in Adelaide, was helped in every possible way by the Government. Perhaps a portion of the debt which- the Commonwealth will be asked to take over from South Australia was employed in helping that foundry. It was closed years ago. Again, take the Phoenix foundry, in Ballarat, which established locomotive building. </para>

                            <para>- At a price higher than that of imported locomotives. That foundry is now closed. Again, take Martin&#39;s foundry, .at Gawler, in South Australia, which made good machinery for agriculture, mining, and other purposes. They were assisted in every possible way by the Government. They built very good locomotives - -I am now using five or six of them - but notwithstanding all the help which was given to them, it was recently stated in the press the business was being wound up. I wish to show honorable members that even a duty of 25/30, or 40 per cent, will not establish an industry if it is not started on a proper basis. I am not prejudiced. I want to show that very often bad management is the cause of failure. </para>

                            <para>- Very often the failure of an enterprise is due to bad management. In Victoria to-day locomotives are being built in the Newport shops as good as, perhaps better than, any which could be purchased in any part of the world. Those locomotives should serve as an object lesson of what can be done if we only get the right man to apply his energy and knowledge to an enterprise. </para>

                            <para>- At Newport locomotives are being built for &#163;1,000 or &#163;2,000 less than they could be purchased for in other countries. I am  under the impression, too, that they are being built by Australians. I know that Australians, if properly trained, are quite capable of handling any industry which may be established in our midst. In proof of that, I may say that the Kalgoorlie mines are being conducted by managers who were born in and have been trained in the Commonwealth, and the work which they are doing compares more than favorably with that which is being performed .in any other part of the world. I have been assured that this is so by men who are capable of judging. I may add that I have had a good deal of experience with workmen, both in Australia and in England, and I consider that in the carrying out of big undertakings the Australian workman cannot lie surpassed. Our men may be a little harder to handle than are those from other countries, but if I were going to another country to build a railway or to undertake any other big work, I should like to take a team of Australians with me. </para>

                            <para>- I might take a small percentage of them, but I should need to catch them when they were a little bit younger than is the honorable member. &#39;In making the comparison which I have made between the work performed in other countries and that which is being undertaken in the Newport railway work-shops, ray object was to show clearly that the establishment of an industry does not necessarily depend upon how much money may be invested in it. Careful thought and proper management are essential to the success of any industry. One grievance which I desire to ventilate has reference to the duty which is at present operative upon steel rails, and to the proposed duty which will be levied upon them under Division VI.A of the Tariff. I am willing to support - and  1  hope that honorable members will do likewise - the payment of a bounty for the manufacture of steel rails in Australia. But until we are producing these rails they ought to be admitted free. We must remember that we have a huge area to develop, and I am certain that dear railways are. of no use to any country. We want cheap railways, and I hope that we shall eventually manufacture steel fails locally even more cheaply than they  can now be obtained from the mother country. . That is one reason why I hold that no duty should be levied upon these rails. There is another phase ofl this question - a very serious one - to which I desire to call attention. At the present time railways which are being paid for out of loan moneys are being constructed in Western Australia and other parts in the Commonwealth. Of course, Ministers will say, &#34; But 75 per cent, of the duty collected upon steel rails is returned to the States.&#34; That, I submit, is not the question at issue. Whatever amount may be returned to the States Treasurers is received by them as revenue, and as such is expended, notwithstanding that it may be money which has been borrowed. The portion retained by the Common-  wealth is also borrowed money. In other words, the duty upon steel rails is paid with borrowed money. That is a nice dilemma in which to place the States Treasurers. They pay the duty upon steel rails out of lain funds, and it is returned to them, in the form of revenue. Such a course of action must hurt the Commonwealth in the future, when it takes over the States debts. .It may happen that the Commonwealth, when it is taking over the States debts, may say of a railway or waterworks scheme in course of construction, &#34;Oh, these do not represent the full amount of the loans raised for these undertakings.&#34; But the States would then be in a position to reply, &#34; That is so, but the Commonwealth has collected 25 per cent, of the loans in the form of duties upon materials, and we have expended our portion of it. The Commonwealth must take over the loans in their entirety. Although the works do not represent all that we borrowed in connexion with them, they represent all that the Commonwealth would allow us to have of those loans.&#34; The same remark would apply to the duty levied upon railway wheels and axles. Railway wheels cannot be made in Australia. I defy anybody to manufacture them locally under present conditions. </para>

                            <para>- No, and they never have been. If the honorable member will refer to the reports of the Tariff Commission, he will find that the representative of Walkers&#39; &#39;Limited, Maryborough, Queensland, declares that railway wheels cannot be manufactured in Australia, and that the quantity required in the Commonwealth is not sufficient to warrant the establishment of the industry here. I can assure the Committee that a very marked improvement in the construction of these wheels has taken place during the past few years. </para>

                    <para class="block">Formerly their centres used to be cast with wrought-iron spokes, but now they,, are composed of one piece of steel. Further, special knowledge will be required before we can manufacture wheels which will run safely upon our Australian railways. I fail to see that it is fair to impose a duty of 2*5 per cent, upon an article which is being used to replace wheels which have been worn out upon the States railways - an article which&#39; could not be manufactured here if we offered .&#163;1,000 for its production. Yet, within the past month, this very article has been landed at Fremantle, and a duty of 25 per cent, has been collected upon it. I come now to the case of wire netting. - From page 29 of one of the Tariff Commission&#39;s reports, I learn that this netting is made by machinery from imported wire. -I ask honorable members to reflect upon the splendid nature of the industry which we are endeavouring to foster. One workman who gave evidence before the. Commission testified that he received 8s. 6d. for making 1,200 yards of wire netting 4 feet wide. Now, 1,200 yards . is equivalent to two-thirds of a mile. </para>

Seeing that one man can make two-thirds of a mile of wire netting for 8s. 6d., what a. splendid industry it is to make a fuss about,, and to permit of bad feeling being engendered between New South Wales and the Commonwealth ! While the proposal of the Government is -being argued, the rabbits are free to spread all over Australia. </para>

                            <para>- I suppose he would do it in a day. Anyway, the wire netting is made of imported material with imported machinery, and the&#34; industry is not .worth troubling about. Then consider the.&#39; effect of the Tariff upon tobacco. I have a list of prices sent out since .the Tariff was introduced, and it shows such increases as from 53. 6d. to 8s., from 4s. 4d. to 5s.&#34; 2d., from 4s. 4&#189;d. to 5s. id., and from 6s. 6d. to 7s. These increases fall on those who . smoke tobacco. In addition to duty, however, we in Western Australia have to pay freight on bringing the tobacco over 2,000 miles by sea, and additional freight on sending it long journeys inland, sometimes&#39; extending over 300 or 400 miles. </para>

                            <para>- The people who buy the sugar receive no &#34;direct advantage from the Excise. I am talking about the effect of the Tariff upon the purchaser. The Minister of Defence might as well ask me how much the tobacco smoker gets out of the Excise. Then take chairs. It seems to me that the Ministry do not want people to sit down, but wish to keep them moving. In one instance, 120 cases of chairs were consigned to Fremantle. Under the old Tariff the duty would have been &#163;76, but under the new Tariff, at 7s. 6d. per chair, it -amounted to &#163;1,080. Then take railway wheels and axles. These are articles that cannot be made in Australia. . The Western Australian Government imported wheels and axles to be put under vehicles made in Western Australia by Australian labour. The value of the imports was &#163;4,815, and the duty amounted &#163;1,204. </para>

                            <para>- At any rate, it is a. fact that these wheels and axles cannot be made in Australia, and it is hardly a fair thing to add 25 per cent, to their price: One of my chief objections to the new Tariff is on account of the effect it will have upon mining. In this respect it especially concerns Western Australia. Mining in Australia directly employs 111,714 men, according to a document supplied to us by the Government. Thousands of persons depend upon these men. The value of the plant and the industry is &#163;12,476,177: I am proud to say that of the total number of men employed in mining, Western Aus tralia employs 20,000.

                            <para>- I will show what can be done in that direction. I admit that the engineering business of Australia is very important. The men employed in it number 1 5,022, and the engineering plant is . valued at &#163;1,195,637. But, compare those figures with the value of the mining plant in Western Australia, &#163;4,395,480, and with the miners employed in Australia, 111,714. The discovery of gold made not only Western Australia, but the whole Commonwealth. It led to the introduction into Australia of the right sort of men, who assisted in opening up the country and building up our many industries. We should be careful not to retard or. hamper in any way the mining industry. In Western. Australia at the present time those engaged in mining labour under many disadvantages. We have from 400 to 600 miles of rail carriage from the coast to the gold-bearing belt in the interior, and the very food supplies obtained by the gold-fields from the eastern States have to be carried over 2,000 miles by sea. Surely when those living there are handicapped to such an extent in this respect we should not attempt to tax all their requisites, including tobacco. </para>

                            <para>- The rejection of the tobacco duties is a question for the Committee to consider. The value of produce annually purchased by Western Australia from the eastern States is nearly &#163;3, ooo,ooo. In five years Western Australia has sent to the eastern States, in money orders alone, an enormous sum. . I have no details as to the cash so remitted to Tasmania or Queensland, but during the period in question a sum of &#163;417,905 9s. 7d. was sent to New South Wales, &#163;348,140 6s. to South Australia, and &#163;1,088,478 12s.10d. to Victoria. If we deduct from the total the amount sent from the east to the west, namely, &#163;238,013 5s. 7d., we have a balance of &#163;1,616,511 2s. 10d. in favour of the east, or over , &#163;1.000 for every working day during the term of five years. These figures should convey to the Committee some idea of the value of Western Australia&#39;s custom to the eastern States. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so. The importance of the mining industry to Australia is not fully recognised. I propose to put before the Committee a few facts gleaned from an undoubtedly reliable source.. The managers of the mines in Western Australia are Australians who believe in Australia, and on the mines there we have the most up-to-date plants in the Commonwealth. The gold yield of Western Australia up to the end of July, 1907, was 17,633,042 ozs., valued at &#163;74,899,496. During 1906 ten mines, employing 4,775 hands, paid in wages to their employes &#163;1,005,373. These mines are in the Kalgoorlie belt, and consist of the Golden Horseshoe, Ivanhoe, Great Boulder, Boulder Perseverance, Oroya Brown. Hill, Hai naul t and Kalgurli, Associated, Lake View, and the Associated Northern. The value of the stores and requisites, annually purchased by them, exclusive of mining timber or water, is &#163;512,117, and. the new Tariff will involve them in an additional expenditure of &#163;50,000 per annum,. The figures I have quoted were compiled by the Kalgoorlie Chamber of Commerce, a body of men as capable as any to be found in Australia. I submit these figures with the greatest confidence. They have been compiled by Australians who believe in Australia, and none of them would do anything to injure his country. The Lake View Mine, employing 400 men and paying &#163;87,000 a year in wages, is working on such a narrow margin of profit that if the Tariff be passed in its present form it is doubtful whether it will be able to continue its operations. The Kalgoorlie Electric Power and Lighting Corporation contemplated erecting a new plant of the value of &#163;12,000. Owing to the new Tariff they have abandoned the project. The consequence is the loss to Australia of the money that would have been spent on labour, railway carriage, and in other directions. We hear that all kinds of machinery can be made in &#39;Australia equal to the imported. I am very .sorry to have to put these figures before the Committee, but I want honorable members to know the facts, and to think them over. The Ivanhoe mine, at Kalgoorlie, had a battery of sixty head of stampers, colonial made. The tonnage put through per stamp per day - what is called the duty per stamp per day - was 4.16 tons. That means short tons of 2,000 lbs. The cost of milling with that colonial battery was 6s. 1 id. per ton. That battery was &#34; scrapped,&#34; and replaced with an imported battery of 100 head of stampers. The duty per stamp per day of this battery was 6 tons, and the cost of milling was 2s. 2&#189;d. per ton. Even allowing for the reduced price of water and other items, which bring the charge for milling for the old battery down to 5s-. 5d., the difference is still 3s. 24d. in favour of the imported&#39; battery. How can the men who are running these mines, even though they be Australians, be in favour of sticking to obsolete machinery when with imported machinery they can work a mine which otherwise would have to be shut down ? That instance is eclipsed by another from the same mine. The amount crushed per month by the old&#39; mill - a. colonial battery - was 6,932 tons. The amount of fuel used was 8.37 cwt. per ton crushed. The new .mill crushed 17,155 tons per month, and the fuel used was 2.91 cwt. per ton. Those are facts. </para>

I can give samples of the efforts made by colonial manufacturers to supply the wants of the gold mining industry. They must pull themselves together and do better work in the future. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Moss,</inline> the manager of the Kalgoorlie mine, ordered twenty head of colonial stamps, and had a guarantee that they would be delivered on 16th October, 1906. After a lot of worry and trouble, delivery was completed in March, 1907, and even then- portions of the battery that was to be colonial made came from two firms in England. The same mine ordered a colonial air-compressor. Delivery was guaranteed for October, 1906, and was only made in </para>

The note about it is, &#34; Five weeks run, stoppages frequent, longest run 83 hours without a stop.&#34; The same mine purchased six grinding pans of- colonial make. The maker had three fitters working for about three weeks on them. Portions had to be sent to a local foundry to rectify errors before the mine would accept delivery. As a contrast, they purchased a 450 horse-power imported engine,, which- was delivered to time, started work as soon as fixed, and has not stopped working since. Those facts show that we must not listen to all the talk about colonial makers being able to do better than Englishmen, or any one else in the world. Let them recognise that they have a lot to learn yet, especially in constructing machinery that will bring down the cost in an industry like mining, where values are getting lower from year to year, and managers are at their wits&#39; end to know .how to reduce costs without cutting down wages. </para>

                            <para>- Nothing of the kind. Three mines at Kalgoorlie proposed to purchase high class up-to-date electrical machinery, of a value of &#163;9,000. That transaction has been abandoned on account of the proposed new Tariff- another case of loss to Australia of the work that that new machinery would have given in the handling of products that can not be handled with obsolete machinery. The eastern States are now prosperous, and should have a little consideration for the western State. From 1902 to 1905 the eastern States suffered from very bad times. In fact I am under the impression that Western Australia pulled them out of the mud and kept them going. Western Australia bought all the horses and produce she required from the eastern States, and, in addition, absorbed their surplus population, who there found work. Much of the money, made in Western Australia has been brought. back to the east, and is being used in the purchase of new areas of land for settlement. </para>

                            <para>- All the commodities that are proposed to be taxed are directly connected with the primary industries of Australia; _ and it is little wonder that we find dissatisfaction in the States. It would appear as though the Government, had laid themselves out to harass every Australian industry ; and yet at the same time they offer preference to Great Britain and New Zealand. All the produce of Australia has to be sold in the markets of the world at the prices there ruling ; and if we harass the primary industries we must injure this country. In the case of woollens and similar goods, we find that Great Britain already supplies us with 75 per cent., and the purchase of the balance of 25 per cent, from foreigners or locally only keeps the British merchants in check. If they had the whole of the trade, there is no telling what prices they might charge us. I am not such a believer in the British merchant as to think he would not avail himself of the opportunity&#39; to get a higher price if he had the chance. The trade of Great Britain is not declining at such a rate that she requires help from Australia. Honorable members opposite have expressed grave fears that -British trade is depreciating ; but, according to page 383 of the report of the Imperial Conference, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George laughed at such fears, and pointed out that the increase in the cotton trade alone, in four years, represented &#163;20,000,000, or more than the whole of the trade with Australia. The Imperial authorities will not accept pur offer of preference ; they are evidently not afraid that British trade is going down too fast. From the tone of the speeches to which I have listened in this debate, I should say that there is no possible chance of the Tariff passing in its present form. I expect it will be considerably modified and toned down. It is, I think, the duty of every member of the Committee in dealing with the Tariff to see that no Australian industry, and especially none of our primary industries, is in any way injured by it. &#34; There is one subject on which I must touch in conclusion.. Many suggestions have been made in connexion with the establishment of a Federal system of old-age pensions. I think the honorable member for South Sydney said that old-age pensions can never be established in Australia unless by direct taxation. </para>

                            <para>- What I wish to say in connexion with old-age pensions is that it is necessary only to divert revenue now collected into another channel to make the requisite provision. As a large employer of labour, and one connected with the mining industry of Western Australia, I can inform the Committee that we have in operation in that State a Workmen&#39;s Compensation Act, under which it has been found necessary for employers to insure their workmen. The amount provided for differs according to the calling in which a workman is engaged, and is arrived at in a very simple manner. We pay so much per cent, on the wages earned by men in different callings. What I propose is that this money, instead of being paid to an insurance company - and one company I represent pays as much as  . &#163;500  or <inline font-style="italic">&#163;600</inline> per annum in this way - should be paid into a State fund. I dislike the term &#34; oldagepensions.&#34; I think that the term used should be &#34; The Australian Provident Fund.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- I do not know the German for it; but I suggest that the term should be something like &#34;The Australian Provident Fund.&#34; I have known&#34; many young people who, having become incapacitated from work, require assistance from such a fund just as much as if they had become incapacitated by old age . In such cases the term &#34;old-age pensions&#34; is clearly inapplicable. &#39; The method I suggest for collecting the fund is a very simple one. The various post offices are now under the control of the Commonwealth, and I suggest that in regard to every person paid wages in any form in. Australia, whether as a servant, coachman, groom, or factory worker, a receipt should be given for the wages received, to which should be affixed stamps purchasable at any of our POW offices as readily as postage stamps are to-day. The reason why I say this money should be collected by the State and applied to the purpose I have mentioned is that I have noticed in Western Australia that when an employe has been injured, his case for compensation is contested in the courts by the insurance company, which employs the best legal talent, and the  has also been compelled to employ legal talent. Perhaps after a long fight an award is made, but very often it is consumed in law costs. In other cases if the  is not very careful the compensation is lost. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, in that form. Perhaps the employé has never handled a large sum before. There are always very smart persons with businesses to sell, which very often are not worth as much as is asked for them. If a man who has been injured buys a business, perhaps he may find that his compensation is gone. My chief reason for wanting the State to take over this liability is that, although a man has been compensated, still he is a charge on the State. If a man has been injured the State&#39;s liability is not discharged by the compensation which has been paid by the employer. Take a place like Kalgoorlie, where the picked men of Australia are at work. If the money were collected while the men were working it would create a fund which could be utilized, and when a man was injured he could claim compensation without any feeling that he was receiving charity in any form. I believe that the magnitude of the fund which could be created in that way would astonish the people of Australia. In Western Australia we have to pay large sums, but very often the compensation which should have been available to the injured employé is consumed in legal expenses. I suggest that the administration of a fund should be entrusted to three persons, namely, a professional man, a representative of the working classes, and a very smart business man. When an employe was .injured, it would not be to the interest of the employer or of the employe to depreciate or magnify the injury. A statement of facts would be handed in to the managing committee, who would decide what compensation the injured man was entitled to receive, and how it should be paid to him. If a man were disabled by old age or injury, he would have no qualms of conscience in accepting a contribution from the fund. He would not be receiving a charity, but a contribution in pursuance of a right. Of course, it could be called State insurance, but I think it is a provident fund in the form of State insurance. That, I claim, is the proper way to proceed, instead of waiting year after year for some action to be taken, and thinking all the while that the only way to attain the desired end was by levying a tax upon land or some other thing. At the present time the money which is paid by the employers goes into another channel. It should be collected, and the risk should be taken over by the Government, and not by a company. I am not stating what might be done, but what is being done, and what I have done for years. The men working for the company I am connected with asked us to go further than that. Each month a collection is made for medical and hospital purposes, and every man who is ill or disabled receives &#163;1 or 30s. per, week, as the case may be. He enters the hospital, not as a pauper, but as a paying patient, and the fee is paid from the fund. I believe that if honorable members would take the trouble to look into the system they would realize that it could be established within a very few weeks. It would not necessitate the appointment of a large army of Government officers or the erection of a large building . in&#39; any centre, because the machinery to work the system already&#39; exists. The post offices throughout the Commonwealth could be utilized for the sale of the stamps, and that would provide the necessary revenue. I thank honorable members for the patient hearing which they have given to me. I shall reserve anything else I have to say concerning the details of the Tariff until another occasion. ^ </para>

                        <para>- I hope that the honorable member for Fremantle will accept my assurance that the leader of the Labour Party did &#34;not say, as he represented just now, that it was impossible to raise the money for the payment of old-age pensions without the imposition of a land tax, nor did any honorable member on this side of the chamber, I think, make that statement without the qualifying remark, &#34; during the continuance of the Braddon blot.&#34; That makes all the difference. The whole point was, thai,  inasmuch as if the Commonwealth wishes to get revenue from Customs duties, it is necessary during the continuance of the Braddon section to raise four &#39;times as much as may be required, obviouslv&#39; it would be impossible so long as that operates, to raise &#163;1,500,000 - which would be the smallest amount needed to institute a Federal system of old-age pensions - because it would mean additional Customs taxation amounting to &#163;6,000,000. </para>

                            <para>- I was rather surprised to hear from the leader of the Government that it is not proposed to enter upon. the consideration of the Tariff in detail as soon as this general debate is finished. Of course the Ministry have the control of the business. I do not wish to find fault with them unnecessarily, but I think that they would be well advised to proceed with the consideration of the Tariff immediately this debate is finished, and not to interpose other business, except, of course, the Estimates relative to new works and buildings. We cannot wait until the Tariff has been dealt with to decide what new works and buildings should be proceeded with. </para>

Uhdoubfedlysome duties will be reduced. The public, therefore, are being charged on certain articles more than they will ultimately&#39; be required to pay. The sooner we arrive at a settlement of the Tariff the better for the trading community and the public generally. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. The debate which has taken place has been chiefly useful in showing the attitude of the various parties in the Committee towards the financial problems which confront us. I was particularly interested in the policy which was foreshadowed by the Opposition corner party. Although that party is a new one, it appears to have a definite policy, and it certainly represents more than does any other party in Australia, the conservative view of politics. I find that most members of that party, and also some members of the direct Opposition, have voiced their strong approval of the sentiments expressed by the honorable member for Flinders. Consequently, T propose to pay particular attention to his speech. This afternoon the honorable member for Brisbane expressed his entire agreement with the speeches of the honorable member for Flinders, the honorable member for Fawkner, and some other honorable members upon the opposite side of the Chamber. But I was very much surprised when he made an attempt to inflame the bitter feelings which exist between the States and the Commonwealth. The honorable member justified the talk of secession in Western Australia and New South Wales, and also the attacks upon Federation, upon the ground that the policy adopted by this Parliament is to continually encroach upon State rights. When he was asked to cite a specific instance, what reply did he give? He stated that our action in regard to the Sugar Bounty. Act was an encroachment upon State rights, as was also the proposal of the Treasurer- which has not yet been adopted by Parliament - to abolish the Braddon section of the Constitution. After the way in which the States without  very much -demur contributed to help Queensland out of the difficulty in which she was placed, owing to the necessity which existed for bringing about White Australia conditions, it came with ill-grace from the honorable member to taunt this Committee with having thus created general dislike and disaffection towards the Federation. At least, we might have expected him to support us in that matter instead of taunting us. But the crowning instance which he cited was the proposal of the Acting Prime Minister to discontinue the Braddon section of the Constitution. When he stated that he was in entire accord with the sentiments expressed by the honorable member for Flinders he must have forgotten that that honorable member had emphatically declared himself as opposed to the continuance of the Braddon section. He may not have used those exact words, but undoubtedly they express his meaning. Now, in regard to this matter, what has the Acting Prime Minister said? Merely this - . </para>

                    <para class="block">I  quote the remarks of the honorable member - with -every word of which.  I  am in agreement - in complete refutation of the statement of the honorable member for Brisbane, that irritation has been caused in the States by the suggested discontinuance of the Braddon section. As a matter of fact, there is no such irritation. Naturally, many of the States Treasurers desire a continuance of that section. But to say that there has .been any general agitation in that direction, and to allege that the movement in favour of secession &#39; has been fostered bv the suggestion to which I have referred is so much idle talk. </para>

                            <para>- What right has the honorable member to accuse us of fostering this movement in favour of secession, because of the suggestion of the Acting Prime Minister that the Braddon section will have to be altered? Everybody will agree that if the Braddon section be abrogated, some other provision will have to be made for the revenues of the States&#39;. No one suggests that we can abolish a provision requiring us to hand over&#34; to the States three-fourths of Customs and Excise revenue, without providing in some other manner for  their financial necessities. I never heard of any one suggesting any such thing. The honorable member said that we must be careful not to embarrass the States. We shall all agree with .that. But the point is that it is -not within the province of a member of this Parliament to inflame an agitation on.th* suggestion that any party in this Committee is attempting to encroach upon the rights of the States, unless he can show some ground for the assertion. If the honorable member could have adduced instances to show that there is antagonism towards the States on the part of any honorable member, he would have been entitled to make that point. But I have been a member of this Parliament from .the commencement, and I know of no instance of a desire to encroach upon the rights of the States or to embarrass them. It is true that there has been a desire, particularly in regard to industrial legislation, to take over all the powers which the&#39; Constitution gives, us to control industrial conditions.  0 &#39; </para>

                            <para>- If we think that the Commonwealth will be benefited by our taking the very fullest powers in framing our Acts, we are justified in adopting that course. I do not think that any single act of that kind has caused any trouble in the States. As to the taxation of the imports of States Governments, while I very strongly deprecate the action of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers,</inline> the Premier of New South Wales, in the wire-netting case, I do not think that it is worth while for the Commonwealth to collect revenue upon such importations. We may have the power to do so, but I do not think it is desirable to exercise it._ A good reason has been suggested by the &#34;honorable member for Fremantle namely, that most of the States&#39; imports are in connexion with works which are paid for out of loan moneys. They are generally imports&#39; of railway material. The New South Wales wire netting pertains to the same category. We return to the States three-fourths of the duty which we-collect, . and that money is paid into the general revenue of the States. Strictly speaking, it ought to be credited to the loan account, but it is not treated in that manner. That is a great mistake.  It would be a great deal better for the Commonwealth not to tax State imports at all. I suppose that to do so is in the nature of an assertion of sovereignty. But if we have the power we are not compelled to use it,  and if  its exercise is a cause of irritation I believe that honorable members would be quite prepared to let the duty slide. It is not of much&#34; value to us. I do not intend to discuss the Tariff at length. I have always taken up a consistent attitude on the question of free-trade and protection. I am a moderate protectionist. Notwithstanding the agitation in favour of high duties, I have  never been in  favour of eliminating the element of competition, and I do not believe in prohibition. I do, however, believe in effective protection - in giving to our manufacturers a wider field. Generally speaking, I intend to support the recommendations of the Tariff Commission, though on some points I dissent from them. I do not think that the kerosene tin industry or the wire-twisting industry are worth developing at great cost to the people of this country. I do not say that they are not worth developing in themselves, but certainly they are not at the huge cost that would be necessary if the proposals of the Government were carried out. Some of the other duties appear to me to be unnecessarily high, and I shall not support them. The honorable member for Flinders has said - and, of course, all must agree with him - that so far as the Tariff protects, so far will it be destructive of revenue. </para>

                            <para>- That is to say, of course, that if an industry is established the imports will be decreased, and to that extent the duty will be destructive of revenue. We must consider the Tariff in the light of its revenue- producing possibilities in 19 10: The honorable&#39; member for Flinders put it that the maximum revenue-producing possibilities of the proposed Tariff are about &#163;9,000,000. But that argument is not sound. Is it not a fact that so far as the Tariff conduces to the establishment of industries, it will increase our population ? </para>

                            <para>- I am not discussing that point. I am dealing with the revenue-producing possibilities of the Tariff. So far as it is operative in reference to the establishing of industries, so  far will the high duties result in increased revenue. But when industries are established, and we make the goods in the country, the effect must be to attract a larger population, which will mean more revenue from other sources. The statement that the maximum return will be &#163;9,000,000 per annum, since the Tariff, as it creates new industries, will lead to a decreased revenue, is not accurate, because, on the other hand, the expansion of our industries will tend to an increase of population, which will be a set-off against the effect on the revenue of the larger local output. </para>

                            <para>- I could understand the honorable member for Flinders, if he were a free-trader, urging that the establishment of new industries would not necessarily increase the population ; that it might simply result in men being diverted from existing trades ; but since he is a protectionist .he cannot use that argument. In the circumstances, therefore, I do not consider that he was wholly right in limiting the possibilities of the Tariff to a return of less than &#163;9,000,000 per annum. </para>

                            <para>- Until they are established a heavy increase in taxation must be borne bv the people, and we shall have for some little time a revenue largely exceeding &#163;9,000,000 per annum. I admit (hat if the duties are so high as to reduce the consumption of certain goods we must suffer a loss of revenue. Such a reduction is possible in respect of some lines, but necessaries must be purchased regardless of the extent to which prices are inflated by reason of the duties. One of the most important points made by the  honorable  member for Flinders was that direct taxation was the province of the States, and that the Commonwealth, for all time, must look for the whole of its revenue to Customs and Excise duties. He urged that the importance of this question exceeded even that of the Tariff) and that in future political battles the dividing line would be between those who claimed that the whole of the revenue required, for Commonwealth purposes should be raised from Customs and Excise duties, and those who urged that some portion should also be obtained by direct taxation. I have no doubt whatever as to what will be the final result of such an issue. . </para>

                            <para>- I cordially reciprocate the feelings expressed by the honorable member. I am delighted with his candour in stating definitely that he and those with whom he is associated are prepared to take up that position. Customs taxation for. revenue purposes is much in the nature of a poll tax. It falls most heavily on those having the largest families, and frequently on the most necessitous. A revenue Tariff is borne by the masses, and I was glad to find the honorable member candid enough to admit that, in his opinion, the whole of the revenue of the Commonwealth, which later on would probably be much in excess of our present income, would necessarily be raised entirely from Customs taxation, or, in other words, by taxation imposed on the masses qf the people. Customs taxation bears no relation whatever to the ability of the individual to pay it, nor to the incomes which may be enjoyed by those on whom it falls. It bears no relation to the natural opportunities - such, for instance, as the ownership of land - of the individual. The mere existence of an individual, apart altogether from the question of whether or not he has any earnings, or is a pauper, is sufficient. The poor man has to contribute his mite, and sometimes almost as much as the inhabitant of Toorak, as some one has said, to the cost of government. </para>

                            <para>- I have already complimented the -honorable member, who has also urged that we must not embarrass the States. He contends that the Commonwealth must be financially independent ; that the Braddon section must be abolished ; and that out of a revenue of &#163;9,000,000 per annum we must return at least &#163;7,250,000 to the States, unless they are to be embarrassed. I understood the honorable member also to say that for a long period that fixed amount would have to be returned to the States. Throughout his speech the honorable member indicated that he meant that to be a fixed payment to the States for a very long period. But if the population increases considerably, does the honorable member mean that the States should be still limited to a payment of  &#163;7,250,000,  or would there be any increased payment to them in the future? I do not want to pin the honorable member down to that statement, because I do not think he could really have meant to limit the payment to the States absolutely to that sum, no matter how much the revenues of the Commonwealth go up, or population increases, or the local expenditure on education, police, and all the other subjects of State activity is augmented as a necessary corollary to the increase of population. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member stated it even more definitely. I thought I had the passage marked. He said that the States could not, or should not, look to receive any more than that amount from us. If that was his idea, I do not think it will work. It would be unfair to the States. The right honorable member for Swan made a much more liberal proposition to the States, apart from the continuance of the Braddon section. Personally, I think that the best proposal is a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> distribution - the payment to the States by the Commonwealth of a fixed amount per head of population. That system would work at first rather unfairly towards Western Australia, and would require a little adjustment, but I believe that that principle will be the proper solution of the difficulty when we do away with the Braddon section. By it the States will be able to know definitely what amount they will receive from the Commonwealth year by year, and can make all their arrangements accordingly. We, on the other hand will know to a penny what we shall have to expend, as the population statistics are made up every year. I do not think that there are any difficulties in the way of the adoption of a method of <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> distribution, which will be found most satisfactory to both parties, and have the effect of allaying a great deal of the existing irritation. The honorable member&#39;s computation of a maximum Customs and Excise  revenue  of  &#163;9,000,000  leaves us a maxi mum revenue for our requirements of  &#163;1,750,000.  The honorable member, however, pointed out that we propose to take over the Northern Territory, and that it will be necessary to undertake a largely increased expenditure on defence. He did not mention old-age . pensions. I do not know whether he did not regard them as a proper subject for early Federal payment. At any rate, he indicated that those two objects, and the taking over of the Departments that must necessarily be transferred to the Federation, would involve largely increased expenditure on our part. The honorable member, therefore, seems to be in somewhat of a difficulty. If we are going to spend considerably more than we spend now on defence, and to spend largely, as suggested by the &#34; honorable member, on immigration, as well as take over the Northern Territory, and some of the present State services, obviously a revenue of  &#163;1,750,000  will not, and cannot, be enough. In these circumstances the honorable member makes no suggestion as to how he would raise additional revenue, unless it is to be inferred that he believes that we ought to raise considerably more than  &#163;9,000,000  by way of Customs and Excise revenue. </para>

If a revenue of  &#163;1,750,000  will not be sufficient for the Commonwealth, if we must undertake largely increased expenditure, absorbing a great deal more, and the honorable member is not in favour of raising a single penny for Commonwealth purposes, except through Customs taxation, there can be only one answer to the question of what his policy is. He must propose to raise a great deal more than  &#163;9,000,000  by way of Customs taxation from the people. </para>

                            <para>- There is no doubt about that. I regret that the honorable member did not mention old-age pensions. That was a notable omission from his speech, but other honorable members in the Opposition corner have expressed their desire to see a Federal system of old-age pensions inaugurated. The honorable member for Flinders suggests as one of the means of meeting future difficulties that we must largely curtail expenditure, and construct some - I do not know whether he meant all - of our new works and buildings out of loan money. That would mean that we should have to give up the policy which we have followed ever since Federation was established. </para>

                            <para>- Oh, no. The honorable member will find that that is not so. I intimated that there might be a very  large  reduction effected by not spending all of the &#163;817,000 which is proposed to be spent this year on works and buildings.&#39; I intimated also that some of these works might fairly be constructed out of short-dated loans with sinking funds. </para>

                            <para>- I do not want to misquote the honorable member. He expressed the opinion that the proposed expenditure this year might very well be reduced ; and I not only agree with that view, but think it is advisable that it should be reduced. But in connexion with the difficulty of making both ends meet after 1910, he threw out the. suggestion that we should have to reconsider, to some extent, the policy we have adopted up to the present, and revert to that which he said had been followed in Victoria, of paying for works of a more permanent character out of loan money. </para>

                            <para>- Of course it means borrowing. The proposal of the honorable member, if carried out, would not be so bad as the old States method of borrowing indiscriminately, without providing a sinking fund. But I think the present system, of paying for new works and buildings out of each year&#39;s income, is infinitely better business, and must increase our standing as a debt-paying country. The honorable member for Kooyong supported the suggestion of the honorable member for Flinders. My own idea is that some of our public buildings are over elaborate, and that some saving might be brought about in this connexion. The buildings now being erected are not so elaborate as those put up when the Departments were under the control of the States. But even now, in many instances, bearing in mind the population in the several districts, it seems to me that we are spending too much on post offices and other buildings. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister of Trade and Customs ought not to have made that interjection, because at Unley, where there is a population of over 20,000 people, the expenditure on the post office was only some &#163;200 or &#163;300. In South Australia we have had to be content with anything but elaborate buildings, and yet we have managed to provide all the facilities that are provided in New South Wales, Victoria, or any other State. The reason is that; until two or three years ago, there practically was never an elastic, buoyant revenue in South Australia, and we had to cut our coat according to our cloth. I believe strongly in retaining the system as long as possible of paying for new buildings out of revenue, for the reason that it has the effect on Parliament of very materially keeping down expenditure. For instance, if we constructed fortifications, barracks, post offices, and so forth out of loans, I am afraid that we might feel inclined to be more extravagant than we are to-day. </para>

He said that the additional expenditure of &#163;249,000 odd represented the increased pay to boys and youths who were doing the same work now that they were doing six years ago. I do not think that the honorable member really meant what he said ; but I have his exact words, which convey the impression that the boys and youths have not grown any older, and are doing the same kind of work now that they did then. But, as a matter of fact, boys who were messengers six years ago are now men, and acting as letter-carriers, mail-cart drivers, telegraph operators, and so on. </para>

                            <para>- The return could not represent anything else. If the honorable member desires to ascertain the increased payments in the Commonwealth Public Service, he may get the information from the Budget papers. At page 103 of the Budget papers honorable members will find the only return worth considering in this connexion, and that is a return setting forth the rate of increase paid to our public servants for doing the work required to be done. The rate of increase is the true test, and the figure approaching the ,&#163;250,000, quoted by the honorable member for Flinders, as&#39; a matter of fact, represents the total increases given to the public servants on promotion to higher positions, and on reaching the age at which they become entitled to the minimum wage. I am sorry that the return to which I refer honorable members has not been extended to apply to all the Departments as well as to the Post and Telegraph Department. However, as it refers to some 11,606 employes, it supplies the key to the position, so far as the whole of the service &#39; is concerned, since the Post and Telegraph Department employs by far the greater number of the public servants of the Commonwealth. I find that in 1902-3 the average salary per officer was &#163;121. In 1903-4, the- year of the classification of the service, it had risen to &#163;128 per officer per annum, or an increase of &#163;7. In .1904-5 it was &#163;.1.30.9. In 1905-6 it was &#163;133.4. In 1906-7 it was &#163;132.8, and for 1907-8 the estimate is &#163;130.7. So that since 1903, the year in which the service was classified, the increase has been only &#163;2.7 per officer per annum. That, estimating the number of officers employed as 11,000, represents a total increase of only ,&#163;22,000 for the work being done. </para>

                            <para>- That is so, but if we deal with the whole period it is clear from this return that the average salary per officer per annum has risen from &#163;12 1 to &#163;130. That rate of increase for 11,000 officers will give a total of less than &#163;100,000. The honorable member for Flinders must see that this return supplies the real test as to the expenditure due to increases of salary. I point out that since the date of classification the increases have not been progressive. That is shown by the fact that the maximum average salary per&#39; officer was &#163;i33:4 in 1905-6, and has since been reduced to &#163;132.8 in 1906-7, and to &#163;130.7 in 1907-8. </para>

Any one who knows the conditions of the service will know that that is impossible. </para>

The true test is found in the rate of increase per officer in the Public Service, and I have shown by a reference to the Budget papers that it has not amounted to more than &#163;9 per head since Federation, and that during the past three years there has been a reduction to the extent of nearly  &#163;3. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member&#39;s suggestion has been that the increases, amounting to about &#163;250,000, involve so serious a matter that Parliament must take into consideration the possibility of. withholding increases until a later date, and postponing, I suppose, the operation of the minimum wage section of the Public Service Act in certain cases. The honorable member suggested that whilst, perhaps, we should not withhold increases from married men, they might be withheld from youths and officers entering upon manhood. When an honorable member bases a proposition that financial considerations require that we shall not only cease to expend so much money on new works and buildings out of revenue, but must also consider the question whether it might not be advisable to withhold Public Service increments, on a statement that we are to-day paying nearly &#163;250,000 more to a number of boys and men for doing the same work as they did six years ago, it is right that it should be explained that the figures, so far from bearing out his contention, show that the service is actual lv costing less per head for the work now being done than it cost three &#39;-ears ago. </para>

                            <para>- No ; the honorable member made that clear enough ; but he said that a payment of nearly  &#163;250,000  over the period since Federation should make honorable members pause before they continued to give increases at the rate previously given. I have dealt with some portions of the honorable member&#39;s speech because I desired to elicit the financial policy of the party which he leads. According to his policy, we are to raise by Customs duties at least  &#163;9,000,000,  probably considerably more, and nothing by direct taxation. For a fixed period  &#163;7,250,000  is to be given annually to the States; and  &#163;1,750,000  annually to the Commonwealth ; some new works must be constructed with loan money, and we should carefully consider whether it is not necessary to withhold the payment of increments to public servants. </para>

                            <para>- In the form in which taxation presses most heavily upon a community, and that is in the form of Customs duties. To save the wealthy from taxation, the whole burden is to be borne by the masses, and the question of ability to pay is not to be considered.  I  can understand honorable members propounding that policy if they take up the position that they represent wealth, but from my point of view it is one of the most cold-blooded propositions ever put before a Parliament. We are to save the wealthy from taxation ; and we are to make Australia a. paradise for &#34;the fat man.&#34; and for all time the masses are to bear the taxation, out of which, of course, will be defrayed the increased expenditure on immigration, as well as on defence, which may benefit the working man, but which certainly will benefit the wealthy. In order to bring about this paradise for the wealthy, we are to enslave financially the masses. </para>

                            <para>- No. If we accept the policy that for all time we must raise annually by Customs duties at least  &#163;7,250,000  to go to the States and  &#163;1,750,000  - probably a great deal more - to go to the Commonwealth, and if we are to permanently collect revenue by that method, and not to impose any direct taxation, surely the honorable member can see that the masses will have to bear the bulk of the expenditure, because what the States will have to provide for will be practically only education and police. </para>

                            <para>- That function will be practically limited to providing for education, police, and a few other matters. We have taken over most of the non-revenue producing Departments. We have left to the States the railways, which are revenue-producing, and which need not enter into the account. If they are sufficiently revenue-producing, as probably they will be before many years have elapsed,  they may yield enough revenue to enable the States to repeal the direct taxation. We find the Premier of New South Wales to-day proposing to reduce the direct taxation, and as the revenues of the States increase, so the direct taxation may be reduced. If we provide the States with sufficient funds from Customs duties they can repeal all their direct taxation, but so far as the Commonwealth is concerned, the expenditure must all be met out of the taxation raised from the masses. Such considerations as the ability of a person to pay, the enjoyment of national opportunities, or the possession of land, are not to be regarded&#39; at all, but the masses are to be taxed permanently in the form of Customs duties. I can understand that policy coming from some honorable members, but I thought that the honorable member for Flinders was a believer in direct taxation. </para>

                            <para>-  I am in favour of it. : <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. BATCHELOR.-</inline> The honorable member understands perfectly the position, and, therefore, his policy seems to me1 to be one of the most cold-blooded policies to permanently enslave a people that I have ever known to be submitted to a Parliament. I desire now to refer to what is known as the &#34;new protection.&#34; &#39;Recollecting the way in which the House viewed the proposals which were made during last session to protect the worker and the consumer; recollecting the way in which every section of the House did what it could to help forward that policy, I- was hoping that it would still be regarded from a non-party view. I shall always regard the attitude of not only the Opposition, but also honorable members in the Opposition corner, towards the new protection last year as an evidence of their humanity. I shall be surprised to find a tirade of abuse directed against the method of, or unnecessary objections offered to, the proposals which are to be made. I expected the honorable member for Flinders to make some reference to the subject. But he said that he would prefer to&#39; wait until some substantive proposals were made - a course of action which he was perfectly justified in adopting. The honorable member for South Svdney, however, did put before the Committee certain general principles, and, inasmuch as I am keenly interested in this matter, I should have liked those principles to have been criticised. </para>

                            <para>- So far from the system having proved a failure, it has been a success in most cases in which it has been applied. In South Australia it has certainly succeeded in shortening the hours of labour, and in increasing the wages of quite 75 per cent, of those engaged in the agricultural implement industry, and it has accomplished this result practically without increasing the cost to the consumer. Unless we can protect the worker, I do not intend to support the granting of any increased measure of protection to industries. If the community fends off competition from the manufacturer, the latter ought not to reap the whole of the benefit, but ought to share it with his workers. The honorable member for Hindmarsh has criticised the. action of some firms in South Australia, who, it is alleged, are evading the award of the Arbitration Court. I do not wish to discuss that question at any length upon the present occasion. I ha.ve in my possession the replies, vouchsafed by the manufacturers, to his allegations, and published in the South Australian newspapers, but. they are very meagre replies, and consequently it is unnecessary for me to trouble the Committee with them.- They simply amount to a general denial of the statement that they have evaded any of the provisions of the Act,- and they are accompanied by a pious expression of opinion on the part of the &#39;secretary of the Protectionist Association that no member of that association would be guilty df such conduct. As a matter of fact, what the honorable member for Hindmarsh affirms - and what I support him in affirming - is that, the  President  of the Arbitration Court having made an award, and it having been stated upon good authority that effect is not being given to that award, it is the duty of the Government to collect the Excise payable by these manufacturers if they are able to do so. If the firms in question continue to refuse to show that the conditions are being observed by them, the Government should at once impose the Excise duty. The alleged offenders would then be compelled to appeal to the Arbitration Court to establish the fact that they are carrying out the conditions under which they were permitted to manufacture their goods free of Excise duty. If the present system of imposing Excise is to be continued, it is essential that the proof of compliance with any order of the Court shall rest with the employers. The honorable member for South Sydney has outlined a proposal in this connexion that it should not be difficult to work, inasmuch as the machinery for the Commonwealth trade mark is already in existence. The  deputy  leader of the Opposition - while the honorable member for South Sydney was speaking - objected that the Commonwealth trade mark and the workers&#39; trade mark were identical, and urged that the latter was the cause of so much friction that it would be inadvisable to legislate further in respect of the Commonwealth trade mark. But I would point out to him that the Commonwealth trade mark and the workers&#39; trade&#34; mark differ fundamentally. The workers&#39; trade mark under the Trade Marks Act simply signifies manufacture by members of a trade union, and nothing else. Upon the other hand, the Commonwealth trade mark signifies that the conditions under which the goods to which it is attached were produced, were controlled by some State or Federal authority. The right to use the Commonwealth trade mark implies that the conditions of labour in an industry are controlled by some State or Federal authority. </para>

                            <para>- The members of the unions would prefer the workers&#39; trade mark, which signifies* membership of a union. They band together for the purpose of maintaining certain conditions. If by legislation we enable a Court to determine what those conditions shall be, there will be no object in unionists remaining united. There will not remain the incentive which now exists for them to band themselves together. At the present time they band themselves together in order that they may mutually support each other in case of strikes. But where Wages Boards or an Arbitration Court are in existence strikes are practically impossible. </para>

                        <para>- Friction is taking place, . and unrest is permeating the Commonwealth. We have had a most interesting discussion to-day, but I am certain that honorable members and the country generally will be glad to receive an intimation from the Government as to their intentions. The Ministry must know perfectly well that they cannot force this Tariff through this Parliament, and I am quite sure that if I move the adjournment of the House to-morrow, with the object of insisting upon a declaration of intentions, the motion will be carried against the Government. </para>

It is of no use for honorable members opposite to laugh, and to deride me because I am presuming to criticise the actions of the Government. The statement was made in the House the. other day that one of the oil companies dealing in kerosene had increased the price to the consumer, although no duty had been paid. I am advised that the sum of &#163;5,800 has been paid. </para>

                        <para>- In view of the unrest in Western Australia, the feeling with regard to the increased duty on chairs, and other causes of uneasiness, we have a right to ask the Government for an expression of its intentions. It is impossible to insist on maintaining the present position unless at the point of the bayonet. The Government has no right to expect the House to go unsatisfied. It is due not only to the House, but to the commercial community that we should know what the Ministry intend to do. </para>

                        <para>- Well, we were engaged for about eleven months upon the last Tariff. The honorable member can make up his mind that we shall be engaged upon this work until after Christmas. I suppose that the debate will be renewed upon each item. I am surprised at the honorable member forgetting what an interference it would be with the interests of the commercial community for the Government to take back the Tariff. The merchants and shopkeepers are raising the prices of goods. Why should not the honorable member be content&#39; to allow them to make a good thing out of the Tariff while they have the opportunity ? I am surprised that he, who usually stands up for the interest of the commercial community, should forget that they are finding operations under the Tariff very profitable. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not think that the honorable member for Indi wished to suggest that the Government should bring down another Tariff Bill. He desires, as we all do, that we should deal expeditiously with the Tariff in the interests of the commercial community, and the public generally. I object, and I think most honorable members do, to legislation which, although important, is <inline font-style="italic">not</inline> pressing, being interposed and the consideration of the Tariff delayed. When an attempt is made to do anything of the kind I shall protest, for I think it would be nothing short of a scandal to spend a week or two in considering measures which are not pressing whilst the Tariff - a question of vital importance to the community, affecting, as it does, every interest throughout Australia - remains unsettled. I hope that the Government will use every endeavour to press forward the consideration of the Tariff. </para>

                        <para>- The Government is anxious to proceed in a reasonable way with the consideration of the Tariff. I have not endeavoured, so far, to induce honorable members to compress their speeches on the Budget, but since the debate has now occupied our attention for some time, I hope that it will close within the next few days. The consideration of the two Bills I have mentioned, as well as of the Works and Buildings Estimates, should not occupy more than two or three days. The Judiciary Bill, to which the honorable member for Corio has referred, is one which only the lawyers in the House are likely to debate. I cannot withdraw anything I have said in reference to the intentions df the Government regarding those measures, and I certainly am not going to frame a partially new Tariff before we. get to the consideration of the present one. </para>
