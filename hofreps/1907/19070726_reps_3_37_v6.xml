                            <para>- The object of the proviso is to exempt certain classes of manufacturers from the general prohibition regarding the payment of bounties to manufacturers, and is necessary in the design of the Bill. It is not practically possible to pay bounties to the men who actually catch fish which are to be dried or canned. Of course, if honorable members are opposed to the giving of bounties for the manufacture of dried or canned fish, they can effect that object when we come to the schedule. Similarly, in regard to dried fruit, the bounty is offered, not for the growing of the fruit, but for its drying or canning. </para>

                        <para>. - The honorable member for Wentworth, to accomplish his object, should have moved the omission of the words &#34;and not to manufacturers,&#34; in sub-clause 2. The bounty is offered for the preparation of these goods rather than for the production of them in the first instance. It is easy to produce many of them, but it is difficult to prepare them properly for market. The Bill offers . very little to the actual grower or primary producer. It will benefit almost exclusively those who manufacture or make-up or manipulate these products. In regard to most of the items contained in the schedule, I dare say, that that is the trouble. The preparation of fibres, for instance, is the one process which is all important. No difficulty is experienced in growing them. There is abundant evidence that they will grow in every latitude in Australia. </para>

I am entitled to (point out that the producer will derive very little benefit from the Bill - that the manufacturer will get more. If the farmers allow themselves to be persuaded into the belief that this measure will help them in their industrial enterprises, they are deluding themselves. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that this measure will help the producers of Australia very much. It will rather tend to assist those who make up these products into marketable commodities. But since the principle of the measure has been affirmed, and it now only remains with us to make the best use of it, I would strongly suggest the withdrawal of the amendment. </para>

                        <para>.- I am not quite sure that this clause will give effect to the desire of the Government. The first sub-clause says that the bounties shall be payable &#34;on the production in Australia of the goods specified in the first column of the first schedule.&#34; In&#39; other words, the bounty is to be paid upon the production of the goods, and not upon the growth of the material. If we turn to the first schedule, we find that in the case of oil materials supplied to an oil factory for the manufacture of oil, the bounty will be payable upon the oil materials, which may not be produced in Australia at all. That will defeat the very object of the Bill. It seems to me that under the clause in its present form it is possible that the materials used in the production of certain goods may be imported from abroad, and the goods produced locally. If a bounty were paid upon goods so produced, the very purpose of the Bill would be defeated. Under the first portion of this clause the bounty is made payable on the production of the goods, but later on a distinction is drawn between the growth of the material and the production of the goods. </para>

If the clause be passed, I will see that all room for doubt is removed. </para>

                        <para>. - My experience is that the local manufacturer can generally be trusted to look after his own interests. It is the producer who really requires assistance if assistance is to be given. Let us take the particular article which is more immediately under consideration - I refer to fish. If there be one class of the community to whom public sympathy is extended it is not the persons who can the fish, but those who go out in boats and catch them. The experiment of preserving fish has already been tried, but has not proved a; success. My own idea is that when these bounties are paid very little of them will find their way into the pockets of the men who ought to receive them. How can we expect to stimulate any industry if these bounties find their way, not into the . hands of the producers, but into those of the men who purchase from them and who generally purchase at their own price. I understand that we shall have another opportunity of discussing the merits or demerits of the measure, but I do not wish the public to imagine that this isa Bill the effect of which will be to develop production. </para>

It seems to me that under it a bounty will not be payable in respect of plants or fruits which are being grown at present. Take the case of dates, for example. As we are all aware some eight or ten years must elapse before date palms come into bearing. Will this bounty be payable upon the production of dates obtained from trees which were planted before the passing of the Bill? </para>

                        <para>.- If effect were given to the views of the honorable member for Franklin, the bounty proposed in respect of combed wool would be payable to the pastoralist who owned the sheep from which the wool was obtained. I venture to say that any such proposal would command very little sympathy indeed. Wool combing is an industry quite distinct from that of wool growing, and in the same  way  fish canning is carried on quite apart from the catching or selling of fish. We need to establish a fish canning industry. &#34;Vast hauls of fish are frequently made&#39;, and In the absence of such  an  industry the local market is glutted, and, as happened quite  recently  in Melbourne, tons of &#39;fish are often throw away. The middle men take care to keep up prices in respect of fresh fish, by not putting too large a supply on the market, and I think that the fishermen would be materially benefited by the establishment of a canning industry. &#39; We have magnificent fish supplies, &#39; and if we intend to proceed on the lines adopted by New South Wales  in  regard to the fishing industry, we ought to take a step further, and do what we can to encourage the canning of fish  in  Australia. </para>

                        <para>.- I would remind honorable members that fish canning has been carried on in Queensland, and also in other parts of the Commonwealth. A few days ago I received a letter from a resident of Broadmount, who was under the impression that the bouncy relating to fish canning was already in operation, and who, with others, is now engaged in catching and canning fish. So far their operations have not resulted in a loss, and it would thus appear chat the industry can be made a profitable one. The bounty would serve a useful purpose, in enabling our fish ssssscanners to overcome the difficulties incidental to securing a footing in the trade. It would tide them over the early years of their industry during which they are seeking to get their brands on the market. As honorable members are aware, the public favour well-known brands, and the grocers who sell tinned fish always stock them, with the result that it is very difficult to place a new brand on the market. This bounty is admirably calculated to tide our fish canners over such difficulties. Whilst we all recognise the desirableness of endeavouring to make the work of the fishermen a profitable one - and from a fishing population we should largely recruit the men required for an Australian Navy - I fail to see how we could provide in this .clause for the payment of a bounty direct to them. As a matter of fact, in many instances canning operations will be carried on along the coast by bodies of men who are also concerned in the catching of the fish. Many fishermen receive so much&#39; per ton for the fish supplied to canners, and it would be very difficult for us to stipulate the price that should be paid to them. The canners must give the fishermen a remunerative price in order to secure supplies. I do not think it would be wise to alter the clause in the direction suggested by the honorable member for Franklin. </para>

                        <para>. - On. looking more closely into the point which I raised a few. minutes ago, I feel fairly confident that my contention is correct. Under the clause as it stands we should make payments - in one case as much as .&#163;5,000  -  in&#39;, respect of materials which were not grown in the Commonwealth, and! also upon the production of goods made in Aus1 tralia from materials produced abroad!. In other words, we should really be paying a bounty to the producers of materials elsewhere, and- to those who worked upon those  materials in Australia. I do not like to propose an amendment, because one of the duties of a draftsman is to see that the Bill which he frames is consistent. I find, however, that in clause 4 the word &#34; goods&#34; is alone used, whereas in clause 3 we have the words &#34; the goods or the materials.&#34; It would be possible to cover the point raised by me by inserting after the word &#34;goods,&#34; in clause 3, the words &#34; or on the growth of the materials in Australia. &#34; If the Attorney-General is satisfied that my point is a good one he will probably have the matter looked into by the Parliamentary Draftsman, and make the amendment necessary to secure consistency. </para>

                        <para>.-I should like to draw the attention of the Attorney-General to a suggestion made last night that we should also provide for the payment of a bounty on smoked fish. Fish so treated are suitable for export, and are less likely to be affected by climatic conditions than canned fish. Another point is that smoked fish are very easy to handle. The establishment of a smoked-fish industry would be of considerable value to our fishermen, and also to the public generally. We could meet this proposal by inserting the words &#34;Smoked fish and&#34; before the words &#34; Fish preserved in tins or casks.&#34; The proposal that we should pay a direct bounty to the fishermen is, I am afraid, impracticable. The object of the Government in proposing a bounty on preserved or canned fish is largely to encourage the investment of capital in such an industry, the establishment of which would materially benefit the fishermen. Canning might be carried on by co-operative parties of fishermen, but I am afraid that at present some difficulty would be experienced in applying that system to such a work. I think there is a good deal in the objection raised by the honorable and learned member for Angas. We ought to be careful to see that the Bill will carry out our intention that goods that are not produced in Australia - that products that are not raised here - shall not receive a bounty. We should have proof that the goods in respect of which bounty is claimed are of Australian origin. Our object is to secure the growth of the raw material as well as the production of the manufactured article in Australia. I am sure that the Minister will recognise the wisdom of the suggestion made by the honorable and learned member for Angas. </para>

                        <para>.- I would remind honorable members that large quantities of smoked fish are already being produced in Australia. In Melbourne and Sydney, fish sellers - many of them in a small way of business - cure fish by smoking them, and they might be seriously affected by the payment of a bounty which would encourage large companies to enter upon the work. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member has already pointed out that co-operation in connexion with the industry might not be readily brought about. Recent inventions have made it possible to hermetically seal tins without the&#39; use&#39; of solder or acids, and thus the keeping properties of tinned fish have been largely improved. There are firms in Sydney which employ a number of men and a lot of machinery in the manufacture of tins, but no such industry is necessary in connexion with the smoked-fish trade. </para>

                        <para>. - The desirableness of making provision for the payment of a bounty on the production of smoked fish was not overlooked, but after consideration it was considered inadvisable to do so. We have acted on information obtained from the best experts in Australia. Amongst others who were consulted when the Bill was in preparation, was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dannevig,</inline> who has a world-wide reputation, and is a man whom the State ought to be proud to have in its service. The imports of fish preserved in tins amounted in value in 1905 to&#163;288,371, showing that there is an enormous Australian market, if it can be captured by Australian producers. </para>

                            <para>- I made inquiries as to Queensland, but could obtain no information. The imports of smoked fish and fish preserved by the cold process amount in value to about &#163;16,505, of which &#163;14,511 worth comes from New Zealand, most of the latter preserved by the cold process. It will be seen, therefore, that in regard to these two classes of fish, the importation is comparatively slight; at any rate it was not deemed sufficient to justify the experts in including those commodities in the items. It is true, as pointed out by the honorable member for Darling, that the smoked-fish industry is already carried on in Queensland, New South Wales, and, I believe, pretty extensively in &#34;Victoria, where New Zealand blue cod is used. There appeared no necessity to include smoked fish in the items; and, technically, I doubt whether we could alter the schedule now, seeing that we have made an appropriation for a specific purpose. </para>

                        <para>.- The smoked-fish industry is very largely carried on by the fishermen themselves, on the northern rivers and coasts of New South Wales, the waters of which are teeming with the best of edible fish. The only market for the fresh fish caught by these men is Sydney, and the transport&#39; is exceptionally bad on account of the harbor bars. The result is that very often, after the fresh fish has been packed, it is found impossible to get it shipped, and it has then to be unpacked and smoked for the market. I support the Bill in the interests more of these men than of any other; and, if a bounty is given, I believe that the schnapper, whiting and flathead of the best quality caught in the waters I have mentioned, will form the basis of a profitable canning industry, because the market for dried fish is more limited than for fresh or canned fish. Canning has been tried in one or two instances, but I regret to say that owing to the keen competition of imported fish, a taste for which has probably been cultivated in the people, the efforts failed. If the canning industry can be established the people of the Commonwealth will be supplied with Australian fish of much better quality than that imported. Experiments have been made at different times by the New South Wales Government in order to ascertain the quantity and quality of the deep-sea fish on the coast, and it has been proved, in this connexion, that there is a mine of wealth to be exploited. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so. I daresay that honorable members who recently visited the Northern Territory heard something of the fish along the north coast of Queensland. Before we left Palmerston, we were informed that a gentleman engaged in salvaging a wreck on the coast, had his work much interfered with by the shoals of schnapper in the neighborhood. Certainly, something should be done for this industry. We all know that one of the greatest treats of the meal table is a good boiled schnapper-, though very often what we are given as schnapper is jew fish. </para>

                            <para>- An additional sub-clause is, I think, necessary. When I was speaking on clause 3, it struck me that there is no provision in the Bill for the apportionment of the bounty between the growers of the materials and the manufacturers of the goods therefrom. It seems to me that the whole context of the Bill displays an intention that there should be such an apportionment that, in other words, if. the materials are grown here and the goods from those materials are manufactured here, the bounty will not be paid to the grower or producer only, but, in a certain proportion, to be prescribed by regulation, will be divided between the producer and the manufacturer. I think that is a very fair interpretation of the Bill, and a very fair principle to be observed; and, if that is the intention, it will be advisable to add another sub-clause to the effect that a regulation shall be. made prescribing the  proportion in which the bounty shall be divided between the grower of the materials and the manufacturer of the goods. </para>

                        <para>. - The recommendation of the. experts, and the opinion expressed in the House nearly unanimously on a previous occasion, were that the bounty should go to the grower or producer ; and if the honorable and learned member looks at the Sugar Bounties Act, he will see that &#34; production&#34; of sugar cane means the growth of sugar cane. These terms are well known, and have been used on all occasions when dealing with sugar bounties. The scheme of the Bill is that certain products shall be grown by farmers, and that on the growth of those products the bounty will be paid to. the farmers under certain conditions. For instance, the cotton must be ginned at a factory, but the bonus will be paid, not to the owners of the factory, because only a comparatively small plant is necessary, but to the growers on the amount of ginned cotton. That is a matter easy of administration, as in the case of sugar. Flax, hemp, jute, and so forth, must be converted into fibres, but the farmers or producers will get the bounty. In the case of oils, the plant necessary is comparatively cheap, but the difficulty is the supply of the raw material ; oil mills in Victoria are idle, simply because they cannot get the necessary supplies. </para>

There are items in which manufacture must be encouraged, in order to get the production undertaken. For instance, in the case of wool tops which means the installation of plant, probably worth &#163;100,000, the bounty will go to the manufacturer. That scheme has been followed throughout the Bill ; and, therefore, the point referred to by the honorable member has not been overlooked. </para>

                        <para>.- I have a suggestion to make which, if adopted will, I think, put this schedule in better form. In the second column there are the words -  &#34;Period dating from 1st July, 1907, during which bounty may be paid.&#34; </para>

                    <para class="block">I suggest that there should be an alteration in this column, so that we may know definitely that the bounty will be paid only when the various crops are borne. For instance, no rubber is being grown for commercial purposes in Australia to-day ; and, therefore, at least seven years must elapse before the rubber trees begin to bear. In such case, the Minister ought to be authorised to start paying the bounty seven years hence. </para>

                            <para>- If one-half of the period during which a bounty is payable in respect to certain kinds of production must pass without it being possible for claims to be made, the total expenditure on bounties cannot come to anything like &#163;530,000. By way of illustration, I have referred to the fact that no bounty can be claimed, for at least seven years to come, for the production of rubber.. It would be more sensible to vote the exact amount which we anticipate will be spent than to hand over to the Ministry a large sum, trusting that they will not spend more than is actually needed. </para>

                    <para class="block">No doubt it is intended that if the goods specified are produced, and the claim for bounty made within the periods dating from 1 st July, 1907, during which bounty may be paid in respect to their production, the producers will be entitled to payment, even though the money may not be available until later. But, according to the strict reading of &#39; the provisions to which I have drawn attention, no payment can be made after the expiration of the periods named. In other words, the producer of ginned cotton may make his claim within eight years from the 1st July last, but, if it is not paid within that period, it cannot be paid without a special vote. </para>

At the end of the periods mentioned in the second column, the bounties payable in respect to the productions mentioned in the first column will expire, and if the schedule is not amended, money will have to be voted  to meet claims put in towards the end of those periods. Imperfect drafting of this kind makes trouble in the law courts, and while, as a lawyer, I am glad to render assistance in improving the measure, as a politician I take exception to the phraseology employed. </para>

                            <para>- I shall do so if necessary. It was not intended that the provisions of the Bill should be construed so strictly as it appears they may be construed. The honorable member for Wentworth, however, hardly conceives the scheme of the measure. The amounts mentioned in the fourth column of the first schedule are the maximum amounts which may be paid in any one year, and most of the goods mentioned in the first column can be produced within a year. That remark applies to cotton, flax, jute, hemp, mohair, peanuts, sunflower seed, rice, tobacco leaf, fish, fruits, and combed wool. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. The total comes to &#163;620,000; but we should be exceedingly optimistic if we thought that the maximum amounts would be claimed in every year from the coming into force of the Act. There are many industries already established in regard to which bounties could be claimed almost immediately. For instance, there are herds of angora goats in the Commonwealth, and therefore the producers of mohair can take advantage of the measure immediately it becomes law. So, too, can the producers of olive oil. Then there are cocoanut plantations in Australia ; at Mackay, and the mouth of the Johnstone River, for example. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. I do not wish to discuss now the merits of the proposals, but I would point out incidentally that it would not be fair to give no bounty for the production of olive oil, seeing that we are proposing to subsidize by means of bounties the production of other oils which compete with it. The honorable member for Wentworth says that rubber is not now being grown in Australia; but plants have been distributed from the Kammerung State Nursery in Queensland. </para>

The scheme of the Bill is determined by column 2 of the second schedule. A certain sum is to be voted each year, and the unexpended balance will accumulate to provide a fund to meet future engagements ; but the expenditure is regulated so that there shall not be a heavy drain upon the Treasurer in any one year. </para>

                        <para>.- The heading of the second column of the first schedule provides that the periods during which bounty may be paid are to date from the 1st of the present month.; but I think it desirable, for two or three reasons, to extend them for twelve months. In the first place, before the Bill has been passed, about eight months of the first year will have gone. What we desire is, not to assist persons who are already making more or less of a success of certain industries, but to induce our population to  enter upon new productions. The reports which we have received in regard to the prospects of the cotton industry are not very encouraging, and, notwithstanding what the Attorney-General has said, I think that that industry is not likely to prove a success. With regard to the production of olive oil, several honorable members have stated that in South Australia olive oil is now being largely produced on a commercial basis, and therefore the giving of a bounty for its production seems to me equivalent to handing over public money to persons who are already doing very well out cf their industry. But to induce our (population to enter into new fields of production is a different matter. I favour the granting of bounties with that object. These annual payments should be made to induce persons to enter upon new industries which are likely to prove profitable. It appears to me wrong in principle to subsidize industries which are already well established. But, in any case, before bringing the Bill into operation, we should allow a sufficient time to producers to perfect their arrangements. Many persons will enter upon the industries which we propose to encourage, if sufficient time is given to them in which to gain the necessary information and experiefl.ee. With the inducement offered by these bounties, I apprehend that many industries will be started, and that we shall accomplish the object which we have in view, namely, the production in much larger volume of commodities which are likely to be of advantage to every member of the community. Therefore I move - </para>

                        <para>. - I ask the honorable member for Echuca not to press the amendment, which simply embodies another phase of the argument for delay. I earnestly desire to see this scheme brought into operation as soon as possible. I am confident trial if the Bill be carried, it will offer a great incentive to people to embark upon these new industries. When we are inviting immigrants to Australia, if the news goes forth to the world that we can produce all these commodities, and that the Government are prepared to assist those who are willing to settle upon our lands by giving them these bounties, I am satisfied a great impetus will be given to the movement. The honorable member for . Echuca wishes to postpone the coming  into operation of the Bill till 1908. But many of these new industries will, I believe, be established within the next twelve months should the Bill become law. We all know that in Queensland, cotton is planted in September or October, and if this&#39; measure be carried I imagine that some growers will take advantage of it during the present season. But even if full advantage be not taken of it during the current year, it will be known that the scheme is in operation, and as a result it will- be availed of more each year. Last night one honorable member advocated delay in the passing of the measure on the ground of the expenditure which is involved. If we bring it into operation this year, I do not think that we shall require to expend the full amount which is specified in the schedule. But no matter how little of the bounties mav be claimed there will at least be evidence of the fact that the Bill is doing some good. I ask the honorable member for Echuca, who is a supporter of the principle of bounties, not to postpone the scheme indefinitely. </para>

                            <para>- Then I ask him not to attempt to postpone the coming into operation of the scheme till next year. I -know that, although the Bill has not yet become law, some persons are actually about to begin operations in the full belief that it will be approved by Parliament. It would be a great disappointment to those engaged in agricultural pursuits if their hopes in this connexion were not fulfilled for another twelve months. I again ask the honorable member not to postpone the coming into operation of a measure which, I am sure, will be attended with highly beneficial results. </para>

I would point out that in South Australia the olive oil industry is firmly established-that at least four large firms are manufacturing the oil - and T desire to know whether the proposed bounty in respect of that article will be payable to those firms? </para>

                            <para>- Then I would ask the Minister why a distinction has been drawn in this connexion between the olive oil industry and the condensed milk industry? The experts point out that if they had recommended the payment of a bounty to encourage the condensed milk industry, a very large sum indeed would have been required to satisfy the claims of existing factories which are in the hands of strong commercial firms. Why is this distinction made between these two industries? It appears to me that if a regulation can be framed which will insure the bounty being paid to the growers of olives, a similar regulation might be framed to insure the bounty finding its way into the pockets of the producers of milk, and not into the hands of proprietors of the existing factories. </para>

                            <para>- So is the olive oil industry. In South Australia, there are four large firms manufacturing olive oil, and they are unable to meet the demands of the Australian public. For years they had only the small market of South Australia open to them, but, now that the Commonwealth market is available, they are unable to meet the popular demand. Those firms, by reason of the splendid article which they manufacture, are able to command from 8s. 6d. to 9s. per gallon for their olive oil, as against 6s. 6d. for the imported article. Why the Minister draws a distinction between the two industries I have mentioned, I utterly fail to see. In my judgment, he is doing an injustice to those who are engaged in the dairying industry, which is one of our big national industries. </para>

                        <para>.- I hope that the honorable member for Echuca will not be induced by the sophistry of the Attorney-General to withdraw his amendment. It is very evident that a considerable time must elapse before persons who are about to engage in new productive enterprises can get the soil into a thorough state of preparation. In addition, a further period must elapse before their crops reach such a state of maturity as to enable them to obtain any; benefit from the payment of these bounties.. Absolutely no argument was adduced by the Attorney-General to show why the operation of the Bill should not be delayed for twelve months. I hope that the honorable member for Echuca will press his amendment to a division. </para>

                        (Brisbane) &#91;11.56&#93;.- I entertain a good deal of sympathy with the idea which prompted the remarks of the honorable member for Echuca. But I feel very much inclined to the opinion  that we ought to achieve his object by a different process. I suggest that we should postpone the payment of these bounties until the new growers are in a position to come in and compete with those who are already engaged in established industries. Take the case of the bounty which it is proposed to pay to olive growers. The honorable member for Echuca has submitted that these bounties were intended to benefit, not those who are already engaged in established industries, but those who may be encouraged to come in and compete with them. The Attorney-General admitted the soundness of that contention. That being so, it seems to me somewhat anomalous that those who are at; present engaged in the olive oil industry should, during the six or seven years which must necessarily elapse before new men would be able to&#39; claim the bounty, reap the whole of the benefit conferred by the Bill.

                        - Exactly. One honorable member has stated that ten years must elapse before olive trees are in bearing. Another honorable member said that the period is five years. When people disagree, it is a sound principle to strike a mean as between their statements, and, therefore, I say that for eight years we may assume that the persons who are already engaged in the olive oil industry will derive all the benefit conferred by the bounty payable in respect of olive oil. Those who may be encouraged to embark upon the venture as a result of the passing of this measure, will only reap a benefit for a very limited period, perhaps less than half that over which the bounty will operate. It seems to me that the proper way to give effect to the idea of the honorable member for Echuca, is to postpone the payment of the bounties in respect of olives and other products until the new men are in a position to step in and take advantage of the Act.

                        <para>. - The first item in the schedule relates to &#34;cotton, ginned,&#34; and I see no reason why a bounty should not be given for the production of that commodity. As I mentioned the other evening, the fact that white labour is employed extensively in America, gives us some encouragement in proposing to adopt this bounty. It would appear, however, that a bounty equal to 10 per cent. on the market value of ginned cotton is to be given as well as a bounty equal to 10 per cent on the market value of the seed extracted from that cotton. In order to determine what would thus be paid on the value of the whole product, we need to have a clear idea of the relative value of the cotton seed quite apart from that of the ginned cotton. The proposal of the Government means the payment of double bounty in respect of what is practically the one product, because the ginning of cotton is simply the extraction of the seeds from the cotton bolls. </para>

                            <para>- I believe it is. We ought to have from the Government a clear estimate of the total amount of the bounties to be paid upon the production of ginned cotton and the seed. We should then be able to understand what this proposal really amounts to. When the bounty is divided up in this way, the intention of the Government is in a measure disguised, and one cannot fully appreciate what it means. It is unwise to pay two bounties in respect of really the same product. </para>

                        <para>.- I support the position taken up by the honorable member for Gwydir, but for an entirely different reason. It has already been abundantly shown that this industry is  a  flourishing one in some parts of Australia, and is highly -profitable. When we consider the character of the reports placed before us, we cannot but be astonished that a bounty on the production  of  cotton should be proposed. It is proposed that the bounties shall commence  from  the 1st July of this year; and this simply means making a present of the bounty to growers who are already making immense profits. It is a shocking condition of affairs when the money of the taxpayers is wasted in this indefensible manner. According to the report, this is largely an industry for the employment of boys and girls of thirteen or fourteen years of age. On page  8  of the report, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jones</inline> says - </para>

                        <para>I found from inquiry that several prospective planters failed owing to continuous wet weather at sowing time to get under crop the area they anticipated when applying for seed. This is the more to be regretted for the reason that the wheat being a failure no alternative crop was sown, thereby making their losses more acute. Many of the farmers intend sowing next season areas as far as their ability to gather the crop will allow. This is to be commended, as until the crop is sufficiently large to induce the immigration of city juveniles to undertake the employment, it is wise to move cautiously. </para>

                            <para>- I have a strong objection to using the money of the . taxpayer to bolster up industries which are spoken of as affording opportunities for the employment of children, because I think that children should not be expected to earn their living&#39; while of tender ages. I prefer to see girls of fourteen still playing with their dolls. It is a - healthier condition of things for the adults of the community to labour, while the children stay at home and play, or fit themselves by study for their future avocations. But, passing from this aspect of the question, I would point out that cotton growing is already an established industry in Queensland, and therefore needs  no  bounty for its encouragement. In support of this position, let me read one or two extracts from the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Daniel</inline> Jones, of the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Stock. Speaking of his recent, visit to the Darling Downs and Maranoa districts, he says - </para>

                        <para>By reason of the unsatisfactory yield of the wheat crop for some years past, I found most of the farmers, particularly in the Maranoa districts, anxious for information as to the value and treatment of cotton crops. This information, by reason of our coastal experience in growing this plant, I was enabled to furnish. As a quantity of cotton seed of both Sea Island and Upland varieties had been .distributed &#39; free of cost by Messrs. J. Kitchen and Sons for this season&#39;s sowing, I had a favorable opportunity of observing the growth of the shrub in many localities, also its behaviour under different, methods, of tillage. For the most part the interest shown has been on the lines of experimental work, hence the areas in no instance exceeded five acres, but a large number of growers are proving the suitability of their land by growing small plots of cotton. </para>

The soils here are of a chocolate, sandy nature, and a class well suited to the cotton plant. These small plots are very valuable from an experimental aspect, inasmuch as they are representative of thousands of acres quite as well adapted as these on which the shrub thrives so luxuriantly. At several places the railway lengthsmen are growing quite a number of shrubs, all of which look well. </para>

                    <para>Not only are the Queensland farmers going in for the cultivation of cotton, but the men working on the railway lines have been attracted by the prospects of the crop, and are cultivating small areas in their spare time. That is the kind of thing that we desire to see; but the giving ot bounties is obviously not necessary to encourage it.

                        <para>Generally . speaking the growers were unfamiliar with the varieties of cotton sown. I was able to determine these, and also advise as to selection of the best plants&#39; for seed purposes, which should help in improving the quality of fibre. My investigations indicate conclusively that in cotton we have a valuable asset, by reason of its simple cultivation, its short period of maturity, its hardihood in its ability to stand drought, its high value, which&#39; permits its transport for long distances without materially adding to the cost of production. These advantages make it a safer crop to depend upon than any other that I have observed in cultivation in these districts. The quality of the staple examined was in both varieties of Sea Island and Upland well up to the standard of their respective types. I feel assured that when the merits of this crop are realised, a large influx of settlers will be drawn to these fertile and cheap lands, which are also easily accessible to the railway. </para>

                        <para>.- The honorable member for Gwydir proposes the omission of the bounty for the production of ginned cotton, on the ground that cotton cannot be grown successfully in Australia; but I have seen it growing wild in the Northern Territory, in rocky, barren ground, and samples which I gathered and brought to Melbourne have been pronounced by experts to compare favorably with samples of cultivated cotton. What will grow wild in this way is sure to prove a profitable crop if cultivated, assuming it to be of commercial value, as cotton is. </para>

The honorably menrber. for Gwydir speaks of it being absurd to grow cotton to sell to Great Britain at a price offered by a Manchester dealer, namely,1d. per lb. But we contemplate manufacturing the cotton grown in Australia into goods to be used here. I anticipate that that will be one of the results of the bounty. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, and what has been done in Queensland can be done in other parts of Australia. The honorable member for Gwydir takes the view that it is absurd to try to grow cotton for sale to British firms at1d. per lb., seeing that the reports say that it cannot be profitably produced for less than11/2d. per lb. But, as a matter of fact, the Queensland firm of Messrs. Kitchen and Company were paying what was equivalent to13/8d. per lb. So that, if the honorable member had quoted the whole of the report instead of merely those portions which suited his particular argument, he would have entirely dissipated his own contention. Another amusing feature of the debate is that the honorable member for Lang supported the honorable . member for Gwydir upon the ground that the cotton industry was an established industry, and that, consequently, there was no necessity to offer a bounty for its encouragement. The honorable member for Lang also stated that the cotton industry could only be conducted by child labour. </para>

Before the argument of the honorable member can be accepted as worth anything, he should show us that the cotton produced in Australia has overtaken our own consumption, whereas last year I find that we imported considerably over 1,000,000 lbs. of that commodity, valued at &#163;22,000. I think that the honorable member for Lang completely demolished the argument of the honorable member for Gwydir that this item ought to be eliminated from the Bill. Both have supplied me with ample reasons why I should support it. </para>

                        <para>.- I am very much surprised that this amendment should have been proposed, because I regard cotton as one of the commodities which we ought to produce, and the production of which might very well be encouraged by a bounty. But the whole of the criticism which has been levelled against this Bill irresistibly reminds me of that which was offered in regard to a certain book. A number of persons who had gathered together admitted that the book was an excellent one. But the anatomist of the party said - speaking of the author -  &#34;His  anatomy is simply horrible;&#34; whilst the geologist exclaimed - &#34; And his geology is pre-historic. He is not up-to-date at all.&#34; When we are informed by the honorable member for Gwydir, who  I presume knows something about the matter, that the cotton industry is not likely to be benefited by the payment of a bounty, it rather tends to shake one&#39;s confidence in the future of that industry. Still, I am in favour of a bounty being granted upon the production of cotton, because the industry is a good clean one, and ought to take root in the Commonwealth. But I am not in favour of a bounty upon mohair. </para>

                        <para>.- The honorable member for Lang has urged that the cotton industry is an industry which is conducted chiefly by child labour. In my opinion, it is equally wrong to sweat either adults or children. But if the employment of child labour in itself be a reason why an industry should receive no encouragement, we ought to abolish quite a number of industries in the Commonwealth. I do not think that his contention is a reasonable one. I would call his attention to the fact that in this Bill we make provision for the prevention of sweating by declaring that a standard wage shall be paid. I am altogether in sympathy with those who would prohibit the employment of children in any industry. There are one or two phases of this matter which, I think, are worthy of attention. The report of the experts states that it was the use of the byproducts of the cotton seed which induced them to recommend the granting of a bounty upon the production of cotton. Upon the face of it, it seems to me that bounties should be given only to industries which hitherto have not become established. It is but natural that some drawbacks and difficulties should have been met with in the few experiments that have been made in cotton-growing. The experiments which have been made in Queensland date back to 1882, and very many things have occurred since then. In the United States, which is a cotton-growing country, a large quantity of cotton has annually to be imported from Egypt to mix with the home article. Seeing that in Australia we have such a vast variety of soils it is quite possible that we may be able to grow cotton equal to the Egyptian article. If we can do so, it will be a very profitable thing for us. I would further point out that recently a machine has been invented for cotton-picking. I object to the employment of children in any industry, but if boys from school must be employed I prefer that they should be employed in the open fields rather than in factories. Whilst I am not prepared to say that the cotton-picking machine can do the whole of the work required, it is, a matter of common knowledge that in the American cotton plantations a large amount of white adult labour is employed. Surely Australians are as good as are the Americans. </para>

                    <para>I have no sympathy with those halfhearted creatures who imagine that we are a poor miserable crowd. The cotton industry is one. which ought to be fostered by means of a bounty, and I believe that if the necessary State assistance be forthcoming it will be permanently established in our midst. I repeat that the circumstances of to-day are more favorable for cotton-growing and manufacture than they were in 1882, when the Queensland experiments were carried out. </para>

                        <para>. - I think that if we do not strike out this item we ought at least to reduce the number of years during which the bounty shall be paid. Cotton is already grown to a small degree in Australia, and I would urge the Minister, if he is not prepared to strike out the item altogether, to agree to the operation of the bounty being limited to five years. </para>

                            <para>- I imagine that the bounty is to be paid on cultivated cotton. Whilst I am not hopeful of its success, I am not prepared to differentiate in the case of cotton, which is one of the chief products that can be grown under suitable conditions in the Northern Territory. The labour difficulty will be the chief one, but, considering that the Northern Territory has suffered under Federation, I think that if we are to grant bounties we should agree to this item. South Australian revenue from the Territory suffered to the extent of over &#163;30,000 per annum by the imposition of the Federal Tariff. Prior to that she had a special tariff so framed as to apply to the chief articles of consumption in the Northern Territory - to rice and other products which, owing to the great proportion of Chinese in the Territory, were largely consumed. In these circumstances, I shall support the retention of the item. </para>

                    <para class="block">Angas, I intend to support the granting of a bounty on cotton since it can be grown successfully, not only in Queensland, but in other parts of Australia, and particularly in the Northern Territory. &#34;&#39; It does not require a great deal of moisture, and its production in Australia therefore may well be encouraged. We have at a comparatively short distance from Australia a market that will take as much cotton as we choose to send to it. A few years ago I travelled in some of the eastern countries, where I found that cotton, utterly unfit for manufacturing purposes, was being grown. It was too short in the fibre to permit of its being manufactured into piece goods, but was used for mattresses and cushions. I found there factories quite as large as any. existing in Manchester or Glasgow, and was asked by some of the manufacturers why Queensland did not grow cotton. They explained that they were aware that wo could produce it, as at one time they had obtained cotton from Queensland, and found it equal to that grown in Egypt, from which the best class comes. I was told that supplies were obtained from America, Egypt, and India, and that if we raised cotton in Queensland, we should find a&#39; ready market for it in the East. I hope, therefore, that honorable members will pause before they decide to reject this item. Cotton can be grown by white labour, although it is doubtful whether some of the other industries proposed to be encouraged under this Bill would be very suitable for the employment of our own people. The attempts made to grow cotton in Queensland in the early days were not unsuccessful, and the fact that the industry was not firmly established was due to failure to make use of the by-products. Thirty or forty years ago, when cotton was first grown in Queensland, the seed was treated as refuse, although, as honorable members are aware, valuable oil can be extracted from it, and there are now other valuable by-products that were then unknown. </para>

The honorable&#39; and learned member for Angas said that cotton did well in the Northern Territory and the northern part of Queensland, and, on (that ground, seemed to think that we should be justified in asking all the States to contribute to a bounty to promote its cultivation. Apparently both honorable members think that the funds of the Commonwealth should be wasted in encouraging, the production of that which already grows wild in some parts of Australia. Then, again, we were told by the honorable and learned member for Angas that the &#34;bounty would be something in the nature pf a sop to the Northern Territory, which  Iliad  suffered under Federation. What &#34;State has not suffered under Federation ? </para>

                            <para>- If this item is to be supported on the ground that it will benefit a part of the Commonwealth which has suffered under the Federal Tariff, I have a aright to argue that consideration should b&#187;: given to certain industries in New South Wales which have also suffered severely under it. If the Government are determined to distribute money in this way they should be prepared to grant a substantial bounty for the encouragement of the iron and ship-building industries. I may well be pardoned for the persistency with which I have put this view before the Committee, when such ardent advocates of -freedom of commerce as the honorable and learned member for Angas and the honorable member for Oxley support a bounty on cotton. When the Tariff was under consideration some honorable members of the Opposition refused to ask for any assistance for industries in their own constituencies. Prominent among those was the&#39; honorable member for Parramatta, who had in his electorate industries that were much interested in the proposals of the Governmnent. No one ever heard him pleading for a bounty for the iron industry in his electorate, nor did I plead, during the consideration of the Tariff, for special treatment for the engineering trades in my constituency. lc is just as well, however, that the mask should be torn away. When I find :an honorable member prepared to affirm the principle of bounties, by supporting a bounty on cotton, it is just as . well that  1  should say at once that I do not &#34;cotton &#34;  to  his argument. The honorable member  for  Oxley has told us that cotton is grown in Egypt, and I might add that the labour employed in its production there is that  which would have to be used here to make the industry a success. I can well imagine, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> how you and the honorable member for Maranoa would view a proposal to build up the cotton industry in Queensland on the lines of the Egyptian system. The honorable- member for Oxley thinks that  white labour could be successfully employed in cotton raising in Australia. If it were, it would be white labour of the character to which I referred last night. Although I have not travelled as the honorable member for Oxley has done, I have met those who have, and have learned from them that the lowly-paid workers in &#39;some countries are not merely coloured persons, but white men. In many Cases they are nearer the Caucasian race than are the yellow or copper-coloured peoples. If it be true that cotton grows wild in the Northern Territory, why should  we  not- allow private enterprise unaided to take up the industry ? My plea is that, if the bounty system is to be adopted in Australia, my electors should receive some benefit from it. I shall, therefore, have much pleasure in voting against this item, so that the &#163;6,000 per annum to be set apart under it may be devoted to the two great industries to which I have previously referred. </para>

                        <para>.- I intend to support this item, although I think that the amount allocated to it is far too low. A bounty of &#163;6,000 per annum, or a total of &#163;48,000, is, in my opinion, totally inadequate. . If the amount were made more commensurate with the possibilities of cotton growing in Northern Australia, I should have much more confidence in assisting the Government to carry the measure. The value to the United States of the cotton crop of last year was over &#163;80,000,000, while the importations of raw cotton into Great Britain, in 1906, amounted in value to &#163;56,000,060; and, when we consider the enormous possibilities of the extension of the manufacture of by: products, it seems to me that we are only playing with the question when we propose such a paltry sum as I have mentioned as a bounty.&#34; .Instead of allocating a certain amount per annum, there ought to be placed in the hands of some competent authority at least &#163;100,000 for the purpose of ascertaining the prospects of this industry in Northern &#39; Australia. It is quite recognised that between 40 degrees north and 35 degrees south the possibilities of cotton growing are great. So strongly was I impressed with the idea that this indus-  try might become an important source of revenue, that, some three years ago, I placed myself in communication with what is known as the British Cotton Growing Association in Lancashire. To that association were sent specimens of Australian cotton, and the reply we received was that the cotton was exceptionally good - that there was no doubt about the quality, and all they were anxious about was the quantity that could be supplied. That association originated with a number of cotton-spinners of Lancashire, who, in the first instance, contributed sums amounting in the aggregate to &#163;50,000 ; but, so desirous were they to render British cotton-spinners independent of even the American supply, that they subsequently subscribed over &#163;500,000, which has been diverted principally in an Egyptian direction. I have read the report of the experts, and know what are the opinions of such an experienced man as <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Thomatis</inline> ; and, moreover, I am aware that other competent opinions have been obtained in South Australia and Queensland. Nevertheless, I say that to properly and systematically treat this problem on business-like lines on a bounty of &#163;6,000 per annum is absolutely impossible. I presume that the iron industry will be dealt with in some comprehensive way, possibly in a separate Bill. </para>

                            <para>-I do not know what the proposals of the Government are in regard to the iron industry at the present time; I have in my mind the proposals made in the past, when the iron industry was dealt with in a separate measure, which the Government were not successful in carrying through. I supported that Bill, because I am strongly in favour of the iron industry being assisted. In my opinion, in view of the magnitude of the possibilities of the cotton industry in our tropical areas, a proper step would have been to deal with any proposed bounty in a separate Bill. As the proposals are at present, a few growers here and there throughout the tropical areas of Australia, who produce a little cotton, will have the right to claim a proportion of the bounty ; and that I regard as trifling with a great question. The most competent and expert advice should be obtained, and an adequate sum placed at the disposal of the Government, in order that they may deal with the question in a. way. likely to produce fruitful results. This is no new industry, because cottons has already been grown in Australia; and the honorable member for Brisbane has pointed out how much has already been done in this direction in the State of Queensland. If there is any possibility of increasing the amount devoted to the encouragement of the cotton industry proposed in this Bill, that step ought to be taken, and it should be quite competent for the Ministry to use the &#163;48,000 in one lump sum if they deem such a course advisable. It is idle to suppose that the proposed bounty will put this industry on a permanent basis, because, with the amount named, it will be impossible for the Government to obtain the experience, advice, and technical knowledge necessary to a successful issue. I hope that the bounty, such as it is, will have the support of the Committee ; but I also hope that the Minister, at a later stage, will show us how he proposes to arrive at any effective result under the circumstances. The cotton spinners of Lancashire, from patriotic motives, contributed half-a-million of money within ten days in order to assist the production of cotton in Egypt. </para>

                            <para>- Assistance is required in the establishment of the industry in Northern Australia. It is urged that cottons growing involves cheap labour; and certainly that is a matter for serious consideration. It has been suggested, however, that cotton grown in tropical areas might be made an addition to existing crops, and that the members of the farmers families should, at the proper time, assist in the picking, which, in the southern hemisphere, is done in the cooler months of May, June, and July. I earnestly ask the Government - if one may do so without one&#39;s motives being misinterpreted - to seriously consider whether the bounty should not be altered from a mere percentage allowance to a large sum of money to be applied in such a way as to obtain the best and most reliable information in connexion with what ought to be a great national industry. </para>

                            <para>- I am quite prepared to assist in that direction. When I went into the question I came to the conclusion that, if a quarter of the consideration which has been given to the sugar industry had been given to the cotton industry, the latter could have been made a pronounced success. But it is trifling with the question to talk about a bounty of &#163;6,000 per annum - to dole out small sums like that in the hope of capturing a great marked of the kind in view. The suggestion has been made that these bounties are merely little &#34; sops.&#34; The object and purpose of the measure should be to establish industries which will be effective in our midst. </para>

                            <para>- Well, I think that this bounty is a &#34; sop.&#34; In this, our initial effort to assist in establishing industries, we ought not to go about the business in a retail fashion, but approach it from a broad national point of view. Those interested in this industry in America will laugh at the idea of offering such a bounty, in view of the magnitude of the operations there; and we shall also earn the laughter of the Cotton Growers Association in Lancashire. </para>

                            <para>- Both propositions cannot be true. When an honorable member, in opposing a proposal, condemns it for two quite opposite reasons, his criticism cannot be as seriously regarded as if he had pursued a consistent line of argument. The honorable member for Lang objects to the giving of a bounty for the production of cotton on the ground that it would lead to the employment of child labour, yet two or three years ago, when the Arbitration Bill was before us, he objected to, and voted against, bringing the dairying industry within the provisions of the measure, although its inclusion was sought on the ground that the employment of child labour in dairying made it necessary that the industry should be tinder the supervision of an Arbitration Court. </para>

                            <para>- This morning the honorable member shed crocodile&#39;s tears at the thought that child labour might be employed in the cotton industry. He argued first, that the cotton industry could not be established in Australia ; then, that it is already in existence here; and, lastly, that if it could be established, its establishment would not be desirable, because the employment of child labour is. essential to its success. </para>

I live in a district in which there are a large number of vineyards, and in the grape cutting season a large number of children, mostly young boys, are employed there; but a special arrangement is made by the Education Department, under which the school holidays are concurrent with the grape season, and  the conditions under which the children work do not call for any great ebullition of sentiment. </para>

                            <para>- The employment which I speak of is not nearly so hard as that in the dairying industry. Many of the children of dairymen have to rise long before daylight to bring in and milk the cows. We all regret the employment of children during their early years. It would be much better if the whole of their time could be given either to school work or to recreation. But we must take things as they are, and for those children that have to be employed, it is better to find work in the open air, cutting grapes or picking cotton, than in factories. If any industry stands out as being particularly worthy of encouragement, it is an industry which is on the borderland of success. It is not probable that the demand for cotton will decrease. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member lays too much stress upon that point. Some time ago an eminent engineer and contractor, who has had charge of large works all over the world, told me that his estimate for labour for the making of railway cuttings, water-courses, and similar operations, is the same, whether the job is to be done in China or in America. He has a uniform price for labour wherever the work is to be done, and he told me that the reason for this is that, if the scene of operations is America, . he employs a comparatively few unskilled men, using them to supervise machinery, while in countries like China or India he dispenses with machinery, and uses a larger number of labourers. Practically the price of labour is the same all over the world. We have been told that the cultivation and picking of cotton is done with low-paid labour, and that may be so; but while labour exclusively is relied upon in those countries where it is cheap and abundant, it will probably be possible to equalize conditions here by the employment of madhinery. It is well known that machinery such as is used in the old country in the manufacture of cotton goods. is not used in India because of the cheapness of hand labour. If Australia enters upon the cotton industry, she must equalize conditions by using machinery in many operations. In the electorate of Boothby, market-gardening and vegetable-growing was at one time, as now round about Sydney and Melbourne, chiefly in the hands of Chinamen, but, owing to the introduction of improved methods, the work is now being done by Europeans. </para>

                            <para>- I may be doing so, but I am trying to meet the argument that a bounty should not be given for the production of cotton, because the employment of cheap labour is essential to the success of the cotton industry. I am pointing out that cheap labour is not essential to the success of the industry - that machinery may be employed, as it has been in other industries which were formerly carried on almost entirely by cheap labour. I may tell the honorable member that one of the methods adopted in market gardening is that of conserving the water and using sprinklers, instead of carrying it - as used to be done - <inline font-style="italic">-upon</inline> the backs of the growers. Then, instead of turning over the ground with the spade and the hoe, a plough is put on to.it. </para>

A large area in Australia is eminently suited to the growth of cotton and other commodities which are specified in the schedule. In my judgment, the payment of a small bounty is calculated to put these industries upon a sound footing, and under such circumstances, I shall support the retention: of the item. </para>

                        <para>.- It seems to me that those who support the payment of a bounty upon the production of cotton must be prepared to answer two  objections. The first is that the industry has already been established, and, therefore, does not require the artificial aid of a bounty, and the second, that the industry can never be established upon a payable basis. I propose to show that neither of these propositions is applicable to the cotton industry. In my judgment, the cultivation of cotton will not be confined to any one State of Australia. Certain kinds of cotton will probably be grown only in Queensland, or, at any rate, in a very moist climate, but other kinds, which flourish better away from the coast, may be grown in any of the States. Regarding the contention that the industry has already been established upon a payable footing, I certainly do not know where that is the case. For some years past attention has been directed to cotton-growing in Queensland. Various farmers have tried to cultivate small plots. I know of one place where&#39; they eventually obtained a ginning machine, which the manufacturers assisted them to purchase. These persons are now growing cotton in a more or less experimental way, and are gradually ascertaining what class of plant is best suited to their particular lands. Thus there is every prospect of the industry being ultimately placed upon a payable basis. In this connexion, I should like to read a short extract from a newspaper in regard to a sample of cotton which was grown by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Thomatis</inline> in Queensland - </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Much has been written as to the merits of Caravonica cotton; a very fine variety grown by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. D.</inline> Thomatis  in the Cairns district. The doctor has been for many years a most persevering experimenter in cotton-growing, and the value of his staple has been assessed by experts at is. per lb. and upwards. When he shipped a parcel to Liverpool a few months ago, however, it failed to reach the price anticipated. But he has lately had great demand for the seed, an&#39;d some time ago refused an offer of a foreign buyer foi&#34; all he possessed. But he perseveres in his attempt to establish the cotton-growing industry in Queensland on a mercantile basis, and it at length appears as though he has succeeded. In another column will be found a copy of- a telegram <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Thomatis</inline> has just received from his agents at Havre, France, which conveys the gratifying information that fifty kilos pf his product had been sold there at the rate of is. 3d. per lb., and that many thousands of bales of that kind were wanted by Belgian and Dutch spinners While it is undoubtedly a riskful  business to try to grow cotton for the world&#39;s market at 5d. or 6d. per lb., there ought to be no uncertainty about the  remunerativeness  of growing Caravonica cotton which will realize is. 3d. The probability is, however, that only on our tropical coast lands can cotton of that kind be grown to perfection. Still, there should be a large -area o&#34;i country in the north suitable for the product. </para>

                    <para class="block">That extract goes to show that earnest endeavours are being made to place the industry upon a sound footing, and I think we all admit - especially after hearing the figures which were quoted by the honorable member for Kooyong - that if it can be made successful it will be a very big thing, not only to the primary producers of Australia, but also to the secondary producers - that is to say our&#34; manufacturers. &#39;Upon that statement, and in view of other instances of which I have personal knowledge - instances in which persons are growing cotton and struggling towards success - we are quite justified in encouraging the establishment of the industry. To my mind the cultivation of this commodity, more than any other set out in the schedule, is worthy of State aid. I am further of opinion that it should receive much more substantial encouragement than it is proposed to extend to it under this Bill. We shall be acting very wisely if we appropriate some of the money which it is intended to expend in fostering the production of other commodities, and devote it to the encouragement of cotton- cultivation. There is another matter to which I desire to direct attention. Honorable members are aware that the Commonwealth has taken over the administration of British New Guinea. We are responsible for the future welfare of the Possession. What I wish to point out is that there are certain commodities specified in this schedule which are the natural products of New Guinea.  Copra  is one of them, and I presume thai palm fruit would be another. It seems to me that, if by the payment of bounties we induce persons in Australia to undertake the cultivation of tropical products which are indigenous to the Possession, we shall eventually be landed in a very awkward dilemma. For example, as soon as the bounty upon the production of rubber is. withdrawn, that article must come into competition with the black-labour product of New Guinea, and the industry will be unable to stand. Shall we then have to raise a Tariff wall against our own Possession? There are certain commodities produced by black labour in New Guinea for the production of which by white labour in Australia, we are offering a bounty. It seems  to me that the money which has been allocated to foster the production of these ai tides, might with advantage be appropriated to encourage the cultivation of  cotton. The argument has been advanced during this debate that the cotton industry was started in America with the assistance of black labour. There is no doubt that that is so. It has also been said that the industry has failed in Queensland in the past. But I would point out that the position nOW is very different from what it was thirty -or forty years ago. At the present time we get a lot of by-products from the cotton, the value of which must be practically equal to that of the cotton itself. For instance, we get the seed, the oil, and the cake, which is made from the refuse. These by-products give the industry a better chance than it formerly enjoyed, of being profitably carried on by means of white labour. I heartily agree with the remarks of the honorable member for Boothby with regard to the employment of child labour. None of us wish to see children taken away  from educational institutions to engage in any form of industry. But any industry which is calculated during the winter months of their holidays to attract them to the country, where they may possibly acquire a taste for rural life, is highly deserving of encouragement. I have nothing further to add, but I do hope that I have succeeded in proving to some honorable members that the cotton industry has been established with a fair prospect of success, although its success has not yet. been assured. There are many men like <inline font-weight="bold">Dr.</inline> Thomatis, who have been trying to establish it for years at the expenditure of much capital, time, and labour, and who, I think, have a very fair claim upon the community for assistance. </para>

                        <para>. - I am sure that, when the encouragement of the cotton industry is under consideration in this House, we all regret the absence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilkinson,</inline> who, during the last Parliament represented the electorate of Moreton. He had made this subject peculiarly his own, and was an authority on every phase of it. I make these remarks without desiring to reflect in any way upon the honorable gentleman whom the electors of Moreton have seen fit to return to this Parliament. I should like to know why the industry is not already well established. On. the occasion of our visit to North Queensland two years ago, we had evidence that cotton could be grown successfully in both the Mackay and Cairns districts. During the recent parliamentary visit to the Northern Territory, I gathered cotton which was growing wild on the Adelaide River, and on showing some of it -to a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline></para>

                    <para class="block">Haig, a cotton-spinner carrying on business upon ain extensive scale in Manchester, was told by) him that the staple was long and of fair quality, although it was somewhat rough. He was surprised to think that such cotton grew wild in the north, and promised to bring the fact under the attention of the Cotton Growers&#39; Association of Lancashire. .This gentleman informed me that his firm had 200,000 spindles in Manchester, and that he had been specially commissioned to inquire into the cotton industry in Japan and India, with a view of ascertaining what effect its competition had on the mill-owners of Manchester. In the circumstances, I agree with the honorable member for Kooyong that a bounty of &#163;6,000 per annum is insufficient to secure the permanent establishment of the industry. The honorable member somewhat marred his speech by referring to this item as a &#34;sop.&#34; I regard it as an honest attempt by the Government to establish industries that can be acclimatized in the Northern Territory, where we desire to secure a large population. </para>

                            <para>- I am sure that the honorable member did not intend to do so, but the expression seemed to me to be hardly appropriate. A bounty of more than &#163;6,000 per annum is required to induce the investment of capital in an industry the returns from which may be very doubtful. Since visiting the Northern Territory, I have become more than ever convinced that the chief problem that we have to face in relation to this matter is the labour one. We shall have to make some sacrifices in the interests of a White Australia. It may be that we cannot successfully engage in certain forms of tropical agriculture in the Northern Territory or other parts of Northern Australia unless we employ cheap labour. Cheap labour is largely employed in the southern States of America, as well  as  in India and Egypt, from which the bulk of our cotton comes. The question is whether we can successfully combat such competition. I believe that the payment of a bounty of &#163;6,000 per annum would not carry the industry beyond an experimental stage. Having regard to the labour problem, it is doubtful whether, after a total expenditure of &#163;48,000 on the cotton industry we should find that we had placed it on a permanent basis. I think, therefore, that we ought to deal with it just as we have dealt with the sugar industry. A bounty Such as that granted in respect of sugar produced, by white labour would make a heavy demand on the Treasury, but we should have in return a permanent and extensive taxable community in the north. </para>

                            <para>- It is a preference or advantage to the extent of  &#163;2  per ton, granted to the growers of sugar by , white labour. I am assured that in the southern States of America coloured labour on the cotton fields is being displaced by white labour. It has been found that black labour, which in the early days was thought absolutely necessary to the industry, and led to the continuation of slavery there for many years after its abolition in other countries is not in the end so cheap as is white labour, and large numbers of Italians and other Europeans are now being employed in the cotton fields. &#34;That being so, we have some reason to hope that the industry may be successfully established here, although the reports that we have received on the subject are not altogether satisfactory. When I tell honorable members that a profit of one-sixteenth of a penny per yard on .made-up cotton is regarded by the largest manufacturers in Manchester as sufficient, they will recognise that a very slight increase in the rates of wages paid in connexion with the cultivation of this product would be sufficient to destroy, or, at all events, to hamper the industry. I trust that the Minister will pay careful attention to the demand that the proposed bounty should be increased. There is a possibility that during the first two or three years no claim may be made for the bounty, and, in that event, the amount set apart for distribution during the remaining years might be increased. I am sure that no one who thought of doing no more than qualifying for. the bounty would regard &#163;6,000 a year as a sufficient inducement to make a start. </para>

                        <para>.- I do not &#39;wish to repeat the arguments which I submitted on the motion for the second reading of the Bill. If there is one item in the schedule that appeals to me it is that relating to the cotton industry, but I have come to the conclusion, after mature consideration, that we shall not be able at the present time to successfully cultivate cotton, either in the north of Queensland or the Northern Territory. I recognise that Ave have areas available for the cultivation of the plant, and I think the Committee will admit that we are able to produce cotton, both in Queensland and the Northern Territory. The question that confronts us, however, is whether we can profitably produce it. That brings us back to the problem of cheap labour. The cotton industry is essentially a cheap-labour one. It is so in America, and the only countries that are competing with it in the growth of cotton at the present time are those which have .available an abundance of cheap labour, for the most part coloured, to do the work. </para>

                            <para>- I am convinced that it would be a good thing, not only for Australia, but for the world, if the monopoly in cotton which is held by the Southern States of America could be broken down. But, as I have said, I have come&#34; to &#34;the mature conclusion that we cannot  produce cotton at a price that would enable us to compete in the &#39; markets of the &#39; world against the American product, unless we are prepared to accept cheap labour &#39;in its production. &#39; In Egypt,- India, the East Indies, and China, where cotton is grown, there is an abundance of cheap labour available for cultivating and picking it. I think it was the honorable member for Darling who said that a recent invention in America would do away with hand labour, in cotton picking. It is true that a cotton-picking, machine has been invented, but, as yet, its success or otherwise has not been proved. There has been no successful attempt to  gather cotton except by humanlabour.&#39; In America, some of this work is being done by white labour - by &#39; Italians, and also by the American farmer, who cai* employ his own children in picking the staple. &#39; That may be a very good or a very bad thing, but I -dread exceedingly the creation here of a greater problem of child labour that we have at present. I am willing to admit with the honorable member for Darling that if we are to. have child labour, it is very much better that children should work- in the open, rather than in. factories ; but I am exceedingly anxious that the lives of the children should be preserved from drudgery, and that they should; have time, not only to go to school, but for the physical development which they so much require. </para>

                            <para>- Then let us say sixteen years. I would join with my honorable friends of the Labour Party in any movement calculated to assist in the physical development and the education of our young people. In Australia we are faced with a very serious problem of this kind. In some of the south-coast districts of New South Wales - and I am told the same obtains in the northern districts, and in some places in Queensland - little children are employed in the dairying industry. Sometimes these children have to rise at 4 in the morning, bring in and milk, perhaps ten or fourteen cows, before going to school. They walk home for lunch, and when they return in the afternoon from school, the cows have to be brought in and milked again, and then they devote what time they have left to home-lesson work. That is too great a strain on young minds and bodies ; and here is presented a problem which we shall be called upon to solve before very long. I am afraid that if the cotton industry were established, we might see a similar state of things in the picking season, and I am very anxious that there should be no such result. I emphatically protest against the insinuation which  the honorable member for Cook made that there is sweating of child labour in the Lithgow ironworks. </para>

                            <para>- Under the State law, boys of that age are allowed to go to work. When I saw those same boys I made inquiries, not only as to their ages, but as to the rate of wages they were getting, and I found the latter to run from 12s. to 18s. per week. I ascertained, moreover, that the police were very strict in the supervision of this labour, and that there were in the works no children under the prescribed school age, unless they had complied with the education law, and had passed certain standards and classes. </para>

                            <para>- I accept the contradiction with great pleasure. We are told that the object of this bounty is the establishment of cotton mills in Australia; and I remind the honorable member for Cook, who expressed the hope that this might be the result, that it will be necessary to have very careful safeguards, seeing that for the last hundred years child labour in cotton factories has been a problem, not only in England and America, but throughout the civilized world. The honorable member for Capricornia quoted the experience of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Thomatis,</inline> as showing that cotton could be profitably grown in Queensland, because that gentleman had received1s. 3d. per lb. for 1 cwt. of cotton in the French market. But, while 1 cwt. of cotton may be produced of sufficient quality to return 1s. 3d. per lb., we have to consider what it cost to produce the cotton. At the time of the American civil war, bounties were given for the production of cotton in India, and the cost of manufacture was something like 2s. 6d. per lb. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Thomatis</inline> was further quoted as saying that the French spinners will take as much cotton as Australia likes to send. We know, of course, that the manufacturers, not only of England, but of Europe generally, and especially of France and Germany, are only anxious to avail themselves of fresh sources of supply, and will take as much good cotton as we can grow. But we cannot grow good cotton at a price which would pay in competition with the United States, especially the Southern States. We must remember not only that America has got the monopoly of the industry, but also that the manufacturers there have developed the byproducts to such a pitch that the profits on the latter suffice. And, further, I think I am within the mark in saying that only about one-fifth of the available cotton lands of the Southern States have, up to the present, been brought into cultivation, so that there is ample room for development to meet increased demands. When we are trying to build up the cotton industry, we must remember that it means competing with cotton grown by cheap labour; and cotton must remain a cheap-labour product so long as the nations at present producing it continue to do so. I repeat that it is with great reluctance I have to give my vote for the amendment. If I could be convinced that we could successfully -inaugurate this industry, I should be prepared to grant a bounty even greater than that proposed, but I am certain that the bounty would not have the result which its proposers anticipate, and, therefore, I must vote in the way I have indicated. </para>

What I did say was that the honorable member did not show as much concern about child labour in other industries. I mentioned that I had seen very young boys employed in the iron works at Eskbank , and that I had questioned them as to their ages, which proved to be about fourteen years. I did not insinuate that the boys are unfairly treated., or that fair rates of wages are not paid to them. I said I would help., not only the iron industry, but any other industry which required assistance. </para>

                            <para>- In the early days of the cotton industry in the United States, there was no idea that cotton would become king, and rest on slavery.&#39; It was only with the invention of the cotton gin, that cotton became the great export of the whole of the United States. I am afraid that we to-day may start the industry, and that years hence, when we are smouldering in our graves, some of the lineal descendants of Balaam&#39;s ass, devoid of all the psychological attainments of their illustrious progenitors, will rise up in this House and demand that we have slavery or cheap or contract labour, simply because the industry is here. It is the duty of every democrat to remove any danger of slavery in the future. As the honorable and learned member for Corio pointed out, black labour in America is being displaced by white labour, which is found to be more constant and valuable. </para>

                            <para>- The blacks are going in to the cities and making slaves of the white people. Some honorable members express a desire to prevent child labour, but all over Australia to-day, in factories and in the dairying and other industries, child labour of all kinds is employed. Therefore, the fear of child labour is no argument against the proposed bounty, though, at the same time, I quite agree that we cannot justify one wrong by perpetrating another. The danger is that we may start an industry, and that, when the bounty is exhausted, another &#39;kind of labour will be proposed in order to make it a success - that, under these circumstances, if we have not direct, we shall have indirect slavery, as amongst the Chinese in South Africa. On that account, I must vote against the item. </para>

                        <para>- - I have listened patiently to-day to a number of speeches ; but they all seemed repetitions of the argument that, because the cotton industry employs cheap labour in other parts of the world, we should not encourage its establishment in Australia. If that argument is to prevail, it can be used against the establishment of any industry here, because in some parts of the world cheap labour is used in connexion with every industry which exists. I shall vote against the amendment. </para>

                        <para>.- It seems to me that we have put the cart before the horse in voting &#163;530,000 for the payment of bounties before deciding what bounties we shall grant. We should first have come to a decision as to how much it is necessary to give to establish each of the various industries which we wish to encourage. But in every case we should see that the amount voted is sufficient to do what we have in view. It is useless to fritter away comparatively small amounts in efforts which must prove abortive. I should like the Government to take into consideration the advisability of allocating&#163;10,000 for the encouragement -of the cotton industry, reducing the bounty for the production of dried fish to&#163;6,000. </para>

                        <para>.- I cannot allow the misrepresentation of the honorable member for Boothby to pass without reply, lest it be quoted against me on some future occasion. As I have already stated, it is quite reasonable to object to this proposal on two diametrically opposite grounds on the ground that the cotton industry cannot be established here - and also on the ground that it is now being prosecuted successfully, because, if it cannot be established, no bounty to encourage its establishment can&#39; have permanent effect, while if the industry is already a success, no bounty is necessary. In regard to what he said about my attitude towards the proposal to bring the dairying industry within the scope of the Arbitration Bill, I find, by referring to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> that in dealing with that proposal I made no reference to child labour, my opposition <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> it being based on other grounds. I have never advocated the employment of children in the dairying or any other industry. I repudiate, too, the assertion of the honorable member for Cook that, while many of us on this side have expressed a great deal of sympathy for the children who may be engaged in the cotton industry, we have no objection to the employment of young children in the iron industry. We have no desire to encourage the employment of young children in any industry. </para>
