                        <para>A definite offer was recently made to the Commonwealth authorities bv ' the  ship-building  firm of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir W.</inline> G. .Armstrong, Whitworth, and Co. Ltd., Newcastle-on-Tyne, in connexion with' the Federal naval construction policy. The offer embraced the construction of 'torpedo boats and destroyers, with partial manufacture in Australia, and it is at present under consideration. Its adoption would mean the establishment locally of ship-building works of sufficient capacity to carry  out the contract. </para>

(3)  Does the Government propose to establish ship-building works for the purpose of naval construction?  (4)  If . so, will the works be centralised, or will various suitable sites throughout the Commonwealth be availed of?  (5)  Before deciding will he consider the exceptional facilities for such purpose now existent at Sydney, both privately owned and State owned?

                        <para>- The honorable member kindly informed me of his intention to ask these questions. No terms have been mentioned, the offer received being merely a general intimation of the willingness of the firm to enter into a contract on suitable terms, part of the work to be done in this country. Other similar general offers, but none that could 'be called definite, have been received. The Government has no intention to establish ship-building works, but should it be resolved at any time to do so, the attractions of our various ports will be considered, and the Governments of the States will then have an opportunity to offer assistance. </para>

                            <para>- In an English newspaper which' I have here, it is asserted that a dozen vessels have Been ordered by the Australian Government, eight of them  26-  knot destroyers, and four  25-knot  torpedo boats, most of them to be shopped here in sections. Then, in to-day',s newspapers, is an account of an interview between Colonel Stanley and the Premier of Victoria, in which the former inquired as to the prospects of State patronage for an English ship-building firm. I wish to know whether there is any truth in the statement in the English newspaper that orders have been given, and I also ask the Prime Minister whether Colonel Stanley should not toe informed that the Government of New South Wales possesses excellent facilities for doing work of this kind, and that an English firm will not be encouraged to enter into competition with it? </para>

In the course of this debate I have mentioned that the Tobacco Combine have control of certain machines ; and I hold in my hand a letter from the City Engine Works, Eagle Wharf Lane, N., London, dated 2nd March, 1905, from which the following is an extract :  - </para>

                <para>We may tell you that we make the Baron machines for the patentees, and can strongly recommend them. Both the Baron and the Orient types are the best in the market, as we have considerable experience in cigarette machines. We regret to say that we cannot sell you a Baron machine, as the Australian rights for same have been sold. </para>
                <para class="block">The Baron machine is the machine which I said was controlled by the Combine. The Orient machine is certainly a good one, but it is not to be compared to the Baron. </para>

                        <para>- At present that firm does not use any machine for cigarette making. Speaking in round numbers, that  firm manufacture about one-fourth of the cigarettes' consumed in Australia, and employ about 700 or 800 operatives, who are engaged, not in making the paper covers, but in filling them. As I explained the other day, the machine-made cover does not allow so much paper to overlap, and, therefore, the deleterious effects of smoking paper are to a great extent obviated. The remaining three-fourths of the cigarettes consumed in Australia are machine-made, and their manufacture employs only from seventy to eighty operatives. </para>

                        <para>- I do not agree with the honorable member; because girls can be employed at the machines just as readily as can men, and the Victorian Factory Act precludes the employment of girls under a certain age.. The honorable member for Angas has said that it is better that tobacco should be stemmed -before being imported, for the reason that, when the leaf is moistened for the purpose of being stripped, it loses in quality. I have had some inquiries made, and I am in a position to say that that is an incorrect statement. Tobacco leaf, whether stemmed or unstemmed, has to be moistened before it can be manipulated here; and the very highest grades of tobacco are imported with the stems on, because it would injure the leaf to previously remove them. High-class tobacco leaf, such as that from Havana, Mexico, Sumatra and Borneo, is never imported stemmed; only the inferior tobaccoes from Germany, America and Japan are sent here stemmed. It is not in the interest of manufacturers to pay a higher duty on unstemmed leaf ; and to get the stripping done here would occupy a fair amount of labour. In Australia 700 or 800 hands are employed in making only one-fourth of the number of cigarettes consumed, whereas over 3,000 could be employed if all were made by hand labour. The Combine's machinery provides three-fourths of the cigarettes consumed. The best cigarette machines are the Bonzac and the Baron. The Bonzac machine is controlled by the Combine, and the Baron machine can be used only by the Combine, who hold the exclusive Australian rights. I do not know whether it is because this question is before Parliament, and, by means of the daily press, before the citizens of Australia, but I must pay the compliment to the Combine of saying that they are now doing their work very well, and acting fairly towards their employes. I hope the Combine will also act fairly towards consumers. One fact, which I wish to sink into the mind of the honorable member for Lang, is that nine hand-made cigarettes are sold at the same price- as are ten machine-made cigarettes in the market of Australia ; and this fact illustrates the great difficulty in the way of the hand-made makers. From my parliamentary experience I doubt whether any speech ever wins a vote ; but, nevertheless, I have much pleasure in submitting the amendment. </para>

                    <para>First. If allowed it will cause a loss of revenue of <inline font-style="italic">£?,737</inline> 3s. per annum on the returns for I006, and this loss will increase, as shown by the percentage of increased manufacture of hand-made over machine-made in the last three, years, which is 81 per cent, hand-made, 8f per cent, machine-made. </para>
                    <para>Second. It will serve to increase the already large profits of the manufacturers by is. 13d. per thousand without any corresponding benefit to the labour employed or to any other interest. </para>
                    <para>Third. The testimony of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Schuh,  a manufacturer of hand-made cigarettes, before the Royal Commission, shows a higher price is obtained for the hand-made, enough to more than cover the difference in the cost of manufacture. </para>
                    <para>Fourth. The additional profit to the manufacturers will be just what is lost to the revenue, <inline font-style="italic">£7*737</inline> 3s-, an their profits, us shown by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Schuh,</inline> are already large. </para>

I have also a memorandum from the Comptroller-General of Customs, who estimates that the loss of revenue would be from ,£4,000 to £5,000 per annum. He also says that the output of hand-made cigarettes is increasing yearly, and that the industry is by no means languishing. With regard to the loss of  revenue,  he says - </para>

The suggestion made by the Comptroller-General is rather an important one. He suggests that the excise should be increased to 3s. on machine-made cigarettes, and 2s. 9d. on hand-made, and he adds - </para>

                    <para>This might possibly counteract the loss, but the question is how far it will operate against the interests of the whole of the Australian manufacturers of cigarettes, as such a rate would leave a difference between imported cigarettes and the Australian made at only is. 6d. and is. gd., and it seems doubtful whether this margin is sufficiently in favour of the Australian manufacturer. </para>

But if the desire of the honorable member for Melbourne could be met  bv  adopting 'he suggestion of the Comptroller-General of Customs, and if the adoption of the suggestion would not perceptibly interfere with other avenues of trade regarding tobacco and cigars, I should have no objection to it. But before agreeing to a proposal of this kind I should like to know whether it would have the effect of disorganizing the duties or affecting their symmetry. Because I admit quite candidly - and I have tried very hard to grasp the whole of this question thoroughly - that it is a difficult thing to understand clearly how the excise will affect the duty, and <inline font-style="italic">vice versa.</inline> I wish to know before I agree to this suggestion whether it is absolutely certain that no injury will be done to the revenue if the desire of the honorable member be met. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that the Treasurer will find that the loss of revenue resulting from the adoption of this proposal will  be considerably more than he anticipates. The figures he has quoted relate only to the initial loss. If hand-made cigarettes replace entirely those made by machinery, it is probable that the ultimate loss of revenue will be considerably greater. Although we may sympathize with the desire that the number of hands in any industry shall be increased, it is questionable whether we should endeavour to accomplish that object by precluding the use of machinery. If we are- to proceed on such lines throughout the framing of the Tariff, a vast field of operations will lie before us. Will honorable members contend for a moment that we ought to adopt such a course? Would it be to the advantage of the community to penalize machine-made goods? I venture to say that if we did  the industries of Australia would languish. It is only by the use of machinery that many of our industries have been able to  attain a considerable output. What reason can the Treasurer give for proposing to penalize the use of machinery in the manufacture of tobacco, and cigarettes ? ' There may be, possibly, some reason for penalizing the use of . machines for cigar making </para>

                        <para>- All the difficult work connected with the so-called hand-made cigarette's is done by machinery ; "the simple process of 'filling is alone done by hand. To encourage that branch of the industry, we are proposing to differentiate in favour of hand-made cigarettes to the extent of 3d. per lb. in the Excise duty. "No ; reason for doing so has been shown "in this case, since the output of hand-made cigarettes is increasing, whilst . the consumption of machine-made cigarettes is proportionately being reduced. The Comptroller General of Customs has supported my contention that under the old" Tariff "handmade cigarettes have been taking the market as against those made by machinery. That being so, why should we make an alteration in the duties which, it appears to me, would result only in adding to the very considerable profits already being made by manufacturers of hand-made cigarettes. </para>

                        <para>- It would result only in adding to the profits of. those who presumably are already securing a very handsome return from their industry: Prior to 1906 hand -made cigarettes were not produced in New South Wales, but in that year there was an output of 4,750 lbs. Then in 1906 152,147 lbs. of cigarettes were imported, or a reduction of 7.7 per cent, compared with the imports for the previous year. In the same year the output of cigarettes subject to Excise - that is to say, locally manufactured cigarettes - was 1,148,033 lbs., an increase of 37 per cent. These figures show that not only are the locally-made cigarettes gaining verv rapidly on the market, but that the output of handmade cigarettes under the old Tariff gained rapidly on the production of machine-made cigarettes. In these circumstances. I fail to see that a case can be made out for increasing the duty in favour of the local hand-made cigarettes. If we do what is proposed we shall either run the risk of losing revenue, or, if by increase of. the Excise the revenue returns be unaltered, of making a present out of the Treasury to manufacturers who are already doing well. No one will claim that that is desirable. Another consideration is whether it is  desirable to encourage cigarette smoking. New Zealand has, I believe, dealt fairly effectively with the matter by allowing no difference between the Excise and the import duties. The duties are so high that packets of cigarettes cannot  be sold at less- than 6d. each, and thus a majority of juvenile smokers are unable to purchase them.. It would be desirable if we could attain that end. I have no hesitation in saying' that the smoking of cigarettes by juveniles is ' one of the evils of the community. By adopting the New Zealand, plan  we might largely check the habit. </para>

At all events, such a large Excise duty is charged that there is not sufficient . encouragement for the local manufacturer, and the heavy duty on the imported article prevents packets of cigarettes being sold at a low price.

                        <para>- I think it will be found that the two duties are the same. While that plan does not encourage the local manufacturer, one very advantageous effect of it is a great reduction of the smoking of cigarettes by juveniles. But leaving that aside as a course which the Minister would perhaps, not be prepared to adopt, and Which would perhaps' be rather harsh to present manufacturers, I would point out that under the late Tariff the local article was so protected that the consumption of it is overtaking that of the imported article, and that the hand-made cigarette had a sufficient advantage to enable it to make rapid strides as against the machine-made. In these circumstances, it would be very undesirable to differentiate the Excise. I cannot see that any sufficient reason has been  shown why the Minister should take that course. </para>

                    <para>. -If  the honorable member for North "Sydney were prepared to move in the direction of prohibiting the manufacture of cigarettes, I should be entirely with him, as I agree that cigarettes are not good for either juveniles or adults; but, as there is no such proposal before the Committee, I am surprised at the honorable member's line of argument. When we were discussing the question of hand-made and machine-made tobaccoes, the cry was, " What is the use of kicking against machinery "? Yet the honorable member for North Sydney now supplies the Committee with ' proof that the hand-made cigarette is not only more desirable, but, in spite of the introduction of machines, is making rapid progress against the machine-made. If that is so, and if it is really a good thing that cigarettes should be made by hand - I think it is, from the labour standpoint, as I understand that there are about three employes engaged in the manufacture of cigarettes by hand to every one occupied in the machinery process- </para>

                        <para>- In any case a great many cigarettes are imported, and it is proved that a more desirable cigarette can be made by hand in Australia. I prefer to see the work done by Australians. If it is a good thing that cigarettes should be made by hand, and if, also, the honorable member for North Sydney is correct in saying that hand-made cigarettes are overtaking the machine-made, then it is right that the Committee should enable them to completely overtake the machine-made cigarettes at once. The honorable member for North Sydney says that one of the objections to the adoption of - the proposal of the honorable member for Melbourne is that we should be thereby making a present to a firm which is already ' doing a very good business. But there is nothing to prevent those now engaged in the manufacture, of machine-made cigarettes from undertaking their manufacture by hand. I am astonished, seeing the large profit that is being made by those now in the industry, that more enterprising commercial men have not engaged in it. But I feel sure that if we do pass the proposal of the honorable member for Melbourne, a large number of firms now engaged in producing machine-made cigarettes . will turn their attention to the manufacture of the hand-made article. For the reasons adduced by the honorable member for North Sydney, I am prepared to support the proposal of the honorable member for Melbourne. </para>

                        <para>- I think it is a good suggestion, from the point of view of the contention that the manufacture of cigarettes is a bad thing. We are not discussing that point at present, and what we want to arrive at is whether .it is better to make our cigarettes here by hand or by machine. If we make them by hand, we shall give employment to 700 people, as against 70 who would be employed if the present proportion of cigarettes continued to be made by machinery. Another reason that appeals to me is that hand-made cigarettes are much more wholesome, or, at any rate, much less deleterious, than machine-made. I am informed that the machine-made cigarette is full of dust, and therefore very injurious. Those are two points which make me inclined to think that we ought as far as possible to encourage the production of cigarettes by hand. The honorable member for North Sydney has raised the question of machinery against hand labour, but in this case I do not think that argument applies. As a rule, I am in favour of machinery every time, because the public are better served by the use of machinery than by hand-work, and because, eventually - and perhaps very soon - actually more people will be employed when machines are used, and the work is better done. In 999 cases out of 1,000 those reasons apply, but they do not apply in this particular case, in which the public are served with a better article at the same price. I have taken the trouble to get a sample of machine-made cigarettes, and another of handmade cigarettes, and find that the public are at least as 'well served by the use of the hand-made cigarettes as by the use of the machine-made. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, and the packet of machine-made has the advantage of containing one more cigarette. If the use of cigarettes is undesirable, then the fact that a packet contains one more cigarette may be regarded as a disadvantage, although, of course, a man is not likely to buy nine when he can get ten for the same money. All things considered, this is a question, not of machinery against hand labour, but of whether, if cigarettes are to be produced here at all, we should not give the work to 700 people as against 70. If the Government will put their foot clown and make the proposed differentiation in the Excise duty, I, for one, shall be prepared to support them. </para>

                    <para>. - The Government might with advantage go even further than they propose in increasing the Excise duty on machine-made cigarettes. I quite sympathize with the suggestion of the honorable member for North Sydney, as I indicated last Friday my view that it would be a good thing if cigarettes generally were made dearer than they are now. Packets can be bought in all the large centres in Australia for 3d. each, and it is the excessive cheapness .of cigarettes that attracts the juvenile portion of the community so much. That is not a good thing. Apart altogether from the question whether cigarette smoking is more injurious that other forms of tobacco smoking, it is undoubtedly a fact that youngsters are encouraged to smoke by the facilities with which they can obtain cigarettes. I should like to see the Government go further than they propose in levying an Excise of 3s. per lb. upon machine-made cigarettes. </para>

                        <para>- Personally, I should like to see a slight differentiation between the Excise imposed upon machine-made cigarettes and hand-made cigarettes, for the reason that I am given to understand that the hand-made cigarettes are less injurious than are the machine-made. I do not pretend to be sufficiently an expert to express a definite opinion upon whether that is so or not. I confess that when my smoking appetite has been jaded I have smoked a cigarette. The Government might very well propose an Excise of 3s. 3d. per lb. upon machine-made cigarettes even if they permitted the hand-made cigarettes to be produced and sold at a slightly lower rate. From the stand-point of revenue also, I think that there is something to be said in favour of my suggestion. </para>

                        <para>- We are not dealing with cigars at present, my figures relate only to cigarettes. Under the differentiation proposed, these profits would be increased to something like £29,350 per annum. The £22,429 to which I have alluded, represents at least 50 per cent, upon the capital invested in the industry by the firm in question. We have heard a good deal concerning the impetus which will be given to employment if we make a differentiation in favour of the hand-made cigarettes. But, as a matter of fact, the wages paid in their manufacture are very much lower than those which are paid in the manufacture of machine-made cigarettes. In the production of the former, unskilled labour is employed. </para>

In the manufacture of machine-made cigarettes a very much smaller number of operatives is employed, but the work is of a more skilled character. The older women operatives who are' employed in this work earn from 20s. to 30s. per 1 week. Machine-made cigarettes necessitate the employment of skilled males also, in looking after the machines. The average of employment is in the proportion of twelve men to ninety girls. The wages of the men range up to .£4 per week. So that honorable members of the Labour Party, in advocating a differentiation between the Excise imposed upon hand-made and machine-made cigarettes, are really advocating a bonus for the employment of child labour at low rates of wages. If they will look into the matter more closely, I am sure that they will hesitate about supporting the proposal before the Committee. I am heartily in accord with the sentiments expressed by the honorable member for North Sydney, who pointed out the undesirableness of encouraging the smoking of cheap cigarettes by juveniles. Whilst we are dealing with these duties I think that we might take some action to restrict, rather than encourage, cigarette smoking by that section of the community. A uniform excise of 4s. per lb. would check the juvenile cigarette smoking habit. </para>

                    <para>. - Honorable members who have acquired the habit of smoking have expressed themselves as being unable to comprehend the technicalities of this particular subject, and it is hardly likely that a non-smoker can accomplish what they have failed to achieve. But this Committee - wisely 01 unwisely - has decided to differentiate between the Excise upon hand-made and that upon machine-made manufactures in -the matter of tobacco and cigars. Now we are asked to extend the same principle to cigarettes. I have a great deal of sympathy with the position taken up by the honorable member for North Sydney, because I believe that of all forms of smoking, cigarette smoking is the most harmful. Consequently I am quite in accord with the honorable member in his desire to restrict the use of cigarettes, particularly by the juvenile portion of the community. " The probability is that, after years of maturity have been reached, the effect of cigarette smoking upon the individual will not be so marked as it is in his earlier years,  when physical development is taking place. To that extent also I am in agreement with the honorable member for South Sydney, who has approved of action being taken in a restrictive direction. But I am not disposed to discriminate between machine labour and hand labour in the matter of taxation generally. To do so would be to run contrary to recognised economic principles. I notice that it has been stated on the authority of one witness, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Barnett,</inline> that a machine in use in South Australia can turn out from 4,000 to 5,000 cigars a day, whereas only some 400 per day can be manufactured by hand labour, or about 2,000 per week. That seems a very big margin. Again, it is pointed out that those who employ hand labour are chiefly persons of small means who are unable to purchase the raw material they require at such advantage as those who can purchase large quantities for manufacture by machinery. We have also to face the fact that the manufacture of tobacco in the Commonwealth is very largely in the hands of a Combine. This Combine exercises a very great influence in trade, and practically shuts out all competition that threatens its supremacy in the manufacturing business, and also in the retail business. Those engaged in the retail tobacco trade particularly feel the influence of the Combine in the regulation of their business.. As an indication of the extent to which the influence of the Combine operates in the Commonwealth, I may  remind honorable members that since the Tariff was introduced, a large portion of the works conducted by this monopolistic institution in Melbourne was shut down. On the 14th August last we were informed that some 500 operatives were shut out. Steps were also taken to shut down works in Adelaide and in Sydney. The first impression conveyed was that the action taken by the Combine was due entirely to the operation of the Tariff, but subsequently it was intimated that there were other reasons for it. It was stated that in Melbourne a proposal was before the Directors for the substitution of electric for , steam power in the works, and in Sydney it -was stated that it was necessary under the new conditions imposed by the Tariff, that the sizes in which plug tobacco was placed on the market should be altered. In connexion with the shutting down of the works in Melbourne, a meeting of the operatives concerned was held to consider their position, and the following paragraph giving the gist of the statements made at the meeting appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald -</inline></para>

                    <para>A largely attended meeting of the members of the Tobacco Workers Union was held in the Trades Hall to-night, and made an emphatic protest against the factory of the British Australasian Tobacco Company being closed down at a minute's notice. </para>
                    <para>It was pointed out that the most unfortunate result of the action of this Combine was the helpless position in which the workers were placed owing 'to the company having practically a monopoly of the trade, thus making it almost impossible for the operators to get work at their trade elsewhere. One of the speakers at the meeting intimated that, in his opinion, the shutting down of the factory was not a result of the Tariff, but was due to other reasons which, to some extent, has since been admitted by the company. One reason given was the enormous production that had taken place just previous to the closing down of the factory. The company had been working at top speed for a considerable perio'd, and had a large quantity of manufactured tobacco in hand awaiting consumption. This gave them an opportunity to close down their works. That statement was to some extent admitted by the manager of the Combine in Sydney, when interviewed by a representative of the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald.</inline> In the issue of that newspaper of the 15th August, the manager of the Combine is reported as having stated that the factory had been working at very high pressure for some tim previously/ On the 19th September, a letter from the company appeared in the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph.</inline> . This letter was dated 19th September, and was published as coming from " The British Australasian ' Tobacco Company Proprietary Limited." It contained the following significant paragraph in reference to the action of the Melbourne operatives, who had been in the employment of the company - </para>
                    <para>We were anxious to prevent any serious loss to our operators from their enforced idleness, and intended to put them, on half pay. For this purpose, and to discuss the Tariff situation, our Melbourne directors proceeded to Sydney for consultation with our directors here early this week. But on Tuesday evening a meeting of the Melbourne operators took place, at which such scandalous statements were made about us, in spite of increases of pay and other benefits that we have recently conferred upon them that our directors, from sheer indignation, decided to do nothing. They therefore telegraphed to Melbourne that they would not carry out this intention with regard to half pay whilst the factory was closed, as it would have the appearance of yielding to coercion. </para>

                <para class="block">This is the position taken up by this large manufacturing company. They closed down their works, at a moment's notice, as soon as the Tariff was introduced, and apparently without taking their operatives into their confidence to any extent whatever. The operatives were simply informed that, on account of the proposed Tariff legislation, their work must cease. Knowing the internal working of the company, and that the operation of the Tariff had been forestalled by large withdrawals of unmanufactured tobacco from the Customs, and by production for some time at high pressure, enabling the company to hold large surplus stocks, the employés gave voice to their feelings in connexion with a matter which very materially affected them. The company intimated afterwards that they intended to give them half-pay, but because something to which they took exception was said at the public meeting, they at once decided, through sheer indignation at the criticism of the operatives, not to carry . out their intention. These circumstances appeal to me very strongly as indicating the extent to which the Combine will go'. If the operatives were not entitled to consideration, they . had no claim, but the company admitted that they were entitled to some consideration since they were prepared to meet them to the extent of giving them half-pay while the works were shut down. But because, at a meeting which was held, some irresponsible persons made statements to which exception was taken, all the operatives, both present and absent, together with their unfortunate wives and children, who, of course, took no part, were punished. This action, of the Combine did as much as anything else to lead me to vote to differentiate between handmade and machine-made tobacco and cigars. The only reason why I am not altogether disposed to act similarly in regard to cigarettes is that, according to expert medical opinion, their use is injurious to health, and most harmful to growing lads. Something should certainly be done to prevent the smoking of cigarettes by our youths, and I am prepared to co-operate in any movement to that end. I think, however, that the principle which has been adopted in respect to the manufacture of cigars and tobacco may reasonably be applied in this instance on the basis of an increased' Excise. </para>

                        <para>- I have ascertained by inquiry that in Victoria there is one large factory in which hand-made cigarettes are manufactured, employing something like 700 hands, and a number of small establishments, whose proprietors hold licences, and turn out only limited quantities of cigarettes. In New South Wales, too, there is a number of small makers, but no large factory. The tobacco manufacturing companies, which have formed themselves into a gigantic Combine, have a monopoly of the New South Wales cigarette trade. They can sell at a profit ten cigarettes for 3d., whereas of the handmade cigarettes they cannot sell more than nine for 3d. Consequently, the Victorian hand-made cigarettes are excluded from New South Wales. It is to the interest of the Combine that no advantage be given to the makers of hand-made cigarettes ; but we should be foolish if we listened to those who hold a brief for it. Last year the revenue from cigarettes was about  £174,000, and the loss which would-be entailed by the proposed differentiation would be about one-fourth of that, or£43,500 </para>

                        <para>- Yes. As a representative of the worker, the farmer, the clerk, and the professional man, I should like to assist in pulling down stones from the top of our gigantic Tariff wall, and, therefore, am inclined to support the proposed differentiation, notwithstanding the probable loss of revenue. As for the difference between hand-made and machine-made cigarettes, as a smoker, I know that the former are the better. When cigarettes are made by machine, the tobacco is thrust into a hopper, and, in the process of manufacture, is cut into small lengths, with a consequent making of dust, which goes into the cigarettes, and may be inhaled into the lungs of smokers, to their injury. But when cigarettes are made by hand, there is not this dust, and the cigarettes are more wholesome and better.. This morning I took the liberty of going, without warning, to the factory of Messrs. Sniders and Abrahams, and was very pleased with what I saw there. Indeed, it opened my eyes. When I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Schuh</inline> to allow me to see the process of manufacturing the cigarettes he very courteously threw open the doors and escorted me over the factory. I found myself passing from floor to floor in a massive and well-constructed building, splendidly lighted and ventilated, and occupied by hundreds of employes, and I was really surprised to find such a place in Melbourne. I had no idea that the factory system was conducted in that excellent manner, and that an. occupation such as the manufacture of cigarettes was carried on under such healthy conditions as I noticed. As the result of my inspection, I learned that the manufacture of hand-made cigarettes gives employment to a number of persons. By the aid of machinery the manufacturer can turn out the cigarettes by practically the million, and we know what an enormous quantity are put on the market; in fact, they have to be turned out in an enormous quantity in order to yield anything like a decent profit. A manufacturer of hand-made cigarettes, however, makes a very much larger profit than does the manufacturer of machine-made cigarettes, and he gives employment to a large number of persons. I had been informed that the average wage which was paid to women and girls - and certainly the employes were chiefly women and girls - was' about ios. per week. I consider that that statement is misleading. At the factory the books were shown to me, and I saw that the wages for girls ranged from  £2  to 5s. per week. A clever girl who could turn out  11,000  cigarettes in a week could make very nearly  £2. </para>

                        <para>- No, because the cost of producing the cigarettes is about '3s. o,d. per thousand. The payment of the girls varied very considerably. Beginners who were doing what was practically untrained work received 5s. per week. All they had to do was to take a pair of scissors and cut off the ends of ' the cigarettes. They were young girls who were practically in the position of probationers, but who as time ' went on would become more skilful, and gradually their wages would be increased. On the top floor there was a room for beginners where they were overlooked, and did their work. It depends entirely upon the agility and skill of a girl whether or not she makes anything like a decent wage. It has been said that the labour employed in connexion with hand-made cigarettes, is not skilled labour. I consider that it is skilled work. In some cases the cigarettes were made by hand almost from first to last. The paper was taken by hand, the tobacco was rolled, and placed inside the paper by hand, and the paper was pasted by hand. In other cases a certain number of machines were used in forming the cartridges, and all the girls had to do was to fill them with the tobacco. The pulling out of the tobacco and placing of it in the cartridge is certainly skilled work. [ am satisfied that any one of us would need a considerable amount of practice before we could do it. In my opinion, an industry of this kind should be encouraged, especially when we find that one factory in Melbourne is giving employment, and what appears to be healthy employment, to no less than  700  persons. The honorable member for South Sydney contends that it is a great pity that' we should allow the youth of the country to smoke cigarettes. That is almost entirely a question for the States to deal with.. In New South Wales, we have a law which was designed to prevent any youth below a certain age from obtaining tobacco from a tobacconist without an order. Unfortunately, one youth is able to write an order for another youth, and the law, I believe, is practically a dead letter. It is a sad thing that in Melbourne a boy is able to enter the shop of a tobacconist and buy one' cigarette for a' half-penny. That, however, is not a matter for us to consider at the present time. It is for the States alone to legislate on that subject. </para>

                    <para>-- One important aspect of this question has * been overlooked by most of the speakers, and that is that imported cigarettes may contain any narcotic, such as opium - of course in very small quantities. We have no legislation to prevent the importation of such cigarettes. Under the health law of each State, opium cannot be placed in cigarettes. It is well known to those who have indulged in cigarette smoking that there is a peculiar flavour about some of the imported cigarettes. No doubt the honorable member for Melbourne could give us some valuable information regarding Egyptian, Turkish, and other imported cigarettes. </para>

                        <para>- No; but occasionally I smoke a cigar, and I have every reason to believe that a hand-made cigar is far better than a machine-made cigar. I believe that some honorable members have urged that if we differentiate between hand Work and machine work, it will be tantamount te saying that machinery shall not be used at all. No machine can pack the tobacco as evenly in a cigar or a cigarette as it can be done by hand. That is one reason why the hand-made cigarettes can hold their own in the market, although a 3d. packet of them contains only nine as against ten in a packet of machine-made cigarettes. We are not contending that all the work shall be done by hand ; but it is a fact that tobacco cannot be packed so evenly by machinery as by hand. The honorable member for Hunter has told us that to-day, without  any warning, he visited a cigarette factory, and was escorted over the place, and had an opportunity lo see the wages list. I have no doubt that the experience of the honorable member could be repeated in almost any tobacco manufactory. The honorable member could possibly tell us of the processes we all had an opportunity of witnessing at the Australian Natives' Association Exhibition in Melbourne a few months ago. There, in the case of hand-made cigarettes, we saw the short pieces and dust blown away, whereas in the case of <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> machine all the. tobacco was turned into a hopper and rolled into cigarettes. </para>

But what is the position ? There is a skilled engineer to look after each machine, which will turn out cigarettes by the million ; and he is paid good wages. The honorable member also told us that the girls or women employed in the packing of machine-made cigarettes receive higher wages than those who make the hand-made cigarettes. As a matter of fact, both classes of operatives get precisely the same wages, namely, 3d. per 1,000; and this destroys .absolutely any force in the remarks of the honorable member.

                        <para>- If the honorable member goes to the person who furnished the information he' will be told that the wages are precisely the same in both cases, only varying according to. the skill and ability of the operative. As stated by the honorable member for Hunter, the girls or women employed in making cigarettes by hand, receive 17s. 6d. a week, although some of them have earned a wage as high as <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> 10s. It was admitted by the honorable member for Lang that there were only twelve men to ninety girls or women employed at the machines. I have the latest report of the Inspector of Factories of Victoria; and from the figures there furnished, I find that there are 330 women, over the age of twenty-one, who average <inline font-style="italic">j£i</inline> 4s. 7d. per week. If, as the honorable member said,  1  there are only ninety girls employed, there must be at least 240 adult females employed making cigarettes by hand who receive the average wage of <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> 4s.  7d. I sincerely trust that some differentiation will be made ; but as to whether the proposal of the Government is enough I cannot say. Persons who turn out cigarettes by machinery do not require the same amount of protection as those who manufacture hand-made cigarettes. The honorable ' member for Lang stated that the profit of Messrs. Sniders and Abrahams, amounted to ,£22,000 odd in twelve months. It must be remembered, however, that that profit is not derived from cigarettes alone, but that that firm make some of the best cigars that are placed on the Australian market. Those of us who had the privilege of lunching at Government House a week ago were given Escudo cigars, which are manufactured by Messrs. Sniders and Abrahams. These, together with the Aristocratica cigars, were the cigars which the- Governor-General saw being manufactured at the Australian Natives' Association Exhibition, and, I am informed, he ordered some from there. As I say, I hope the Government will make some differentiation between hand-made and machine-made cigars. In this connexion the tobacco trade industry stands apart from any other; and tobacco, from a fiscal point of view, cannot be treated like any other commodity. </para>

                    <para>. - My feeling in reference to cigarette manufacture is that I would favour a bonus for those who manufactured cigarettes that would sicken the youngsters who use them, and thus cure them of the smoking habit. It is melancholy to hear of the enormous consumption of cigarettes in Australia, amounting, I believe, to something . like  600,000,000  annually. I am glad that there were no cigarettes in my young, days, because I know I should have got on better with them, than with the form of tobacco in which I experimented. It is a thousand pities that there should be this enormous consumption, which I regard as one of the serious dangers to the Commonwealth. The honorable member for Yarra spoke of the power that the. States have, as distinguished from the inability of the Commonwealth, to take steps in regard to the deleterious compounds included in imported cigarettes, suggesting that opium is present to some extent. I think, however, that there is complete power in the Customs Act to deal with ah evil of that sort. Section53 of that Act provides - </para>

So far as concerns the account given by my honorable friend, the member for Hunter, of the factory which, exists in Melbourne, we must all, of course,, be pleased to hear of such conditions existing in connexion with an industry in Australia. My regret is that such a splendid factory, and the young" girls employed in it, are not engaged in something which would be more beneficial to the Commonwealth at large. I trust that the interests of the revenue will be respected in this matter. The question of differentiation is one that should be regarded from the point of view of the revenue.

                        <para>- I have never looked upon the tobacco duties from the point of view of fiscal differences. In New South Wales, when we had the freest Tariff in the world1 - we had only five taxable items - there was always a substantial difference between the Excise on Australian-made tobacco and1 the duty on imported tobacco. Even in England, there is a difference in one line. At all events, I have heard so during the debate ; I have not checked the statement.. I look upon the cigarette trade as a most injurious traffic, . and would rather see the duties put up than down. That could be done without preventing honorable . members from carrying out the idea of a differentiation in favour of hand-made cigarettes. </para>

                <para>Zealand. I thought for the moment that he was wrong, but I find they carry out a policy which would be to our advantage. I learn that they make no difference at all between imported and locally-manufactured cigarettes. They impose a stiff import duty, and give no protection to the locally-made article. In that way, they have been able "to Wipe out cigarette smoking amongst the juveniles of New Zealand. I should be delighted to support any such project, here, but I know that at present it is impracticable. I should, however, be glad to support such an increase of these duties as would have the effect of discouraging cigarette smoking. I do not think there is any suggestion that the manufacturers of hand-made cigarettes are not making a' handsome profit. The hand-made article appears to be rapidly increasing in popularity as compared with the machine-made cigarette. If that is the case, under present conditions, without any difference, it seems to me that we might very well put these duties up without injuring the manufacturers at all. They are doing well enough, I understand, and if we could only in some way discourage the use of cigarettes, whether imported or locally-made, I should be glad. </para>

Excise as it stands, and by inserting additional words differentiating in favour of hand-made cigarettes. Before I can move an amendment to that effect, however, it will be necessary for the amendments now before the Chair to be withdrawn. What I intend to propose is, that after the words " three shillings," the words " and if hand-made, on and after the 9th October, 1907, per lb., 2s. 9d." be inserted. That would give a preference of 3d. per lb. to hand-made cigarettes. </para>

                    COOK (Parramatta) statements made during this debate, and am bound to say that they do not convince me that this differentiation ought to be made. If they mean anything, they mean that we ought to get very much more revenue than we now derive from cigarettes. I think the trade could stand . it. The figures show that.

                        <para>- My honorable friend does not smoke, I think. There is a great difference between the two. We may very well leave the adult life of the community to look after itself in . this particular. But it does occur to me that our juveniles would be benefited by our making cigarette smoking as difficult as possible. We might very well take a leaf out. of the book of New Zealand, by making it much more difficult for juveniles to indulge in the habit of cigarette smoking. The figures which have been placed before us show that the manufacturers of hand-made cigarettes are not in any way suffering under present circumstances. Why this differentiation should be made has not been made clear to me. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that I know what hard work is as much as my honorable friend does. It is strange to hear in these days of advanced civilization the argument that we should betake ourselves to the discouragement of machinery, which we thought tended to lighten the tasks and toils of the world, and should go back again to a condition from which we have slowly emerged in the course of many decades. The leader of the Labour Party said the other day that there were some political troglodytes in the world, and I immediately replied that it occurred to me that the troglodytes were to be found in the Labour corner. Here, again, is an argument that suggests the correctness of my retort. We are told that we should make this differentiation because <inline font-style="italic">it</inline> would provide! more work. My impression is that the way to provide more work is to take the fullest, fairest and freest advantage of the machinery which is evolved from time to time to meet the tasks of the world, and that it is a distinct step backwards to put aside machinery and go back to old time methods of hand labour. However, there seems to be some fear that these machines are a monopoly. I apprehend that such a state of affairs cannot long prevail, and that if a monopoly exists it is because of certain patent rights. If that be so, I hope that my honorable friends of the Labour Party will not try by a side wind to prevent the inventors of the machine from taking full and fair advantage of their patent rights. I trust that we have not reached in our history a time when Parliament is prepared to set aside the patent rights of traders. </para>

We are told, in the first place, that this proposal is designed to enable the public to secure a better article, at presumably no greater cost. That the cost cannot be much greater is shown bv the fact that handmade cigarettes are holding their own in the market, and that their output is increasing.

                    <para>. - I am afraid that if the amendment be carried the intention of the Committee in agreeing to the amendment with which we have just dealt will be nullified. On the occasion of a visit to the Exhibition where hand-made cigarettes were produced, I saw paper run through a machine which printed two or three words in gold type upon it. This paper was used for cigarette casings, and it seems to me that under the proposed definition such paper could not be used in the manufacture of hand-made cigarettes. Then, again, the paper itself is made by machinery. </para>

                    <para>.- I submit that the proposed definition, even as amended, would not cover the process that we have in mind. It would provide that the whole of the operation connected with the "'filling and completion" of hand-made cigarettes shall be performed exclusively by hand labour. It is with the filling of the cigarette cases, and not with the filling of the cigarettes themselves, that we have to deal. We need to provide that the filling of the paper or tubing by hand shall constitute " making by hand " within the meaning of the section. As the amendment was first worded, the Comptroller-General would have known quite well what the Committee meant, but now the Acting Prime Minister should state what he means by it in its altered form. If we desire to be quite accurate and precise, the amendment, as amended, is not a precise definition of the process. </para>

                    <para>. - One evening last week I was asked whether I, or the Government, would arrange to take first some items lower down in the Tariff. I need not say that, personally, I think that is scarcely a proper course to take, but I made a promise, and I propose to state now what the Government are -prepared to do. I have- had several persons trying to make lists of what items should be taken first, and I find that nearly every one wants his own list taken. I cannot see that much good is to be derived from making any proposal of the kind, but there was a very strong expression of feeling the other night that the item of wire-netting should be taken.. If it is the will of the Committee to take wire netting first, the Government will not oppose it. But I hope the Committee will not then desire to go on to anything else, because once we begin to go from one item to another- </para>

                        <para>- If we . take kerosene we may take fifty other things. I feel that it must be a very exceptional case to justify any deviation from the order of the Tariff as submitted. It is only in consequence of the very strong expression of opinion given the other night regarding wire-netting that the Government will even go so far as to agree, if the Committee so desires, to take " wire-netting." But when we move a single step in that direction we find trouble. I have tried to draw a list of the more urgent items, but I find that it is absolutely impossible to do so. If we take one or two, we may take a dozen, or twenty, and every other honorable member is found to have some item which he considers just as important as the items taken. </para>

I feel that if the proposal had not been made to give priority to the item of wire-netting, it would have been in the interests of the Tariff and of its speedy passage. If that expression of opinion had not been given the other night I should not have dreamt of agreeing to anything being taken out of its order. If there is going to be an unduly long discussion over the question, then the Government are not prepared to allow that delay to take place. </para>

                        <para>- I do not offer any such invitation, but I wish the views of the Government to be clearly understood, because to take an item out of its order in this way is to deviate from .the proper course, and to adopt a procedure which 'is most exceptional. The expression of feeling to which I have referred" regarding the question of wire-netting is a hysterical sort of thing, and I am surprised at some honorable members being so hysterical about it. It is all very well to say th,at a little unpopularity attaches to this or that proposal, but as the Tariff is before the Committee, my own feeling is that we should not deviate at all unless the Committee is as anxious as it appeared to be the other night to give the item of wire-netting priority. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I was asked specially more than once the other night to give precedence to the item of wire-netting. Wire-netting was the only item which I mentioned specifically. ' I said that the request would be considered. I did not refer especially to any other items. I was as cautious as I could be when I spoke on that occasion, because .1 had to deal with the proposal at a moment's notice. I hope that there will not be a long debate. If there is not, we might dispose of this item very soon. If it is the wish of the Committee, I shall be quite prepared to move in such a way as to allow the item of wire-netting to be considered first. </para>

                    <para>- I am very sorry that the Treasurer has agreed to the suggestion to give precedence to the consideration of this item, because, in his speech, he advanced the verv strongest reasons why that course should not be adopted. In the first place, he stated that he had made a promise to consider wire-netting out of its order upon the spur of the moment, and under a misapprehension, and that he had been led to believe that something would have occurred other than what has occurred. I have never heard a more admirable statement of why an agreement that had been arrived at should be declared void. If it were ? contract at law, the Court would at once declare it void. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. He is a navigator of unexampled excellence. I cordially agree with all that has been said  in favour of immediate consideration being, given to the duty upon wire-netting. I appreciate the importance to the main industry of the country, of allowing wire-netting to be obtained as cheaply as possible. The Government, without any provocation whatever, imposed a duty of 30 per cent, upon that commodity, and then the Treasurer, with a great affectation of regret, declares that there- is much hysteria in connexion with that duty manifested all over the country. Who is to blame for this ? It is most unfair to interrupt the orderly course of public business which the honorable gentleman himself had decided upon, and is re- . sponsible for. What attempt has he made to ascertain whether the Committee cannot agree to the selection of half-a-dozen items for consideration out of their order? He has not consulted the leader of the Opposition, the  deputy  leader of the Opposition, the honorable member for Dalley, myself, or anybody else in this connexion. But, by some impudently assumed power of prescience; he declares that he knows that we cannot agree upon giving precedence to the consideration of any half-a-dozen items. I decline to accept his statement. </para>

                        <para>- That is precisely what I propose to do. There- is no other wav of finding out what the Committee favours. To affirm that we cannot agree upon the selection of five or six items for early consideration, is to brand us with unintelligence. Before I accept the Treasurer's statement, I shall require the Committee to decline to agree to four or five items which I shall put before honorable members. To show what a reasonable person I am, I am quite wil!',ng to agree to the early consideration of any six of the items upon the schedule that I have prepared, and I shall include wire-netting in them. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. There is no doubt that wire-netting is an important item, but surely the food and clothing of the people are of equal importance. I do not think that the members of the Opposition can deny that. The one cry that ascended to the heavens during the recent elections in New South Wales was that  2S. 6d. per week represented the precise increase in taxation which had been placed upon the working men of that State. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers</inline> was very particular in respect of two items. The first item was wire-netting, and the second was the rest of the Tariff. He specially mentioned the duties upon kerosene and tea. He bathed himself in kerosene and he lived upon tea. He referred to blue, soap, candles, and all those things. He said, " If you want a chair, there is a duty of 7s. 6d. to pay on it," and so on. I propose to give the Committee a number of items, from which I shall select half-a-dozen, and I venture to say honorable members will not have the courage, even if they have the- wish, to declare that any one of the half-dozen is not of as great importance to the people at large, and not merely a section of the community, as wire-netting is to a section. Take, first, the duty on blue, a common article of the household, in which the humble washerwoman is concerned. I remember that in 1894, when the right honorable member for East Sydney was introducing his land-tax proposals, a howl was raised by the Opposition side about the land held by the poor widow. Later on, when we came to deal with the Early Closing Bill, a howl went up from the right honorable gentleman's own side about the widow woman who owned a shop. Here we are dealing with the poor widow who makes a living by taking in washing, and who, under this Tariff, will have to pay 2d. on every lb. of blue, instead of1d. under the old Tariff. </para>

                        <para>- It is easy to be seen that the honorable gentleman knows nothing of the mysteries of the laundry; or he would know very well that there is nothing more calculated to wear out the feminine soul than is locally-made blue. Candles are dutiable under this Tariff at 2½d., and under the old Tariff at1d. Candles, n.e.i. - and I am not sufficiently an authority on the subject to say what kind of candles these are - are now dutiable at1½d., instead of1d. These articles concern adults, but juveniles are also affected. I find that the duty on confectionery is 3fd., and it was formerly1d. Currants, now dutiable at 3d, were formerly dutiable at 2d. Dates, now 2d., were formerly dutiable at1d. Matches are now dutiable at1s. 9d., and formerly at 6d. Salt, n.e.i., is now at 20s., and was formerly at 12s. 6d. </para>

I find that mining machinery is now dutiable at 35 per cent., instead of 12½ per cent., as  under the old Tariff. In view of these proposals, are we to sit down and do nothing?

                        <para>- The honorable member has naturally selected other items. He is able to look upon the proposed duty on wire-netting from an impartial stand-point. I am looking at it, I hope, as a citizen, and not merely as a public man. I say that if we are to deviate from the order of the items as they appear in the Tariff, we should consider such items as tea, kerosene, woollen goods, apparel, and attire, mining, electrical, and agricultural machinery" as soon as wire-netting. We may be at the commencement of another great drought, though I hope not, and the farmer is called upon to- bear an impost which must, until Australian manufacturers are able to supply Australian requirements, add to his burdens an amount which he can ill afford to pay. In the circumstances I say that we cannot, and I shall not willingly, permit any item to be given prior consideration to that of agricultural machinery. As for mining machinery, I do most emphatically say that tens of thousands of people look to the mining industry of this country for a livelihood, and it is ari extraordinary proposal to place on that industry an impost of this sort, which cannot be regarded as excused by any desire to foster local manufacture, because, as a matter of fact, some of this machinery is of a highly complicated character, . and a good deal of it is protected by patent. Consequently it must be obtained elsewhere, if we are to continue to treat our low grade ores, and if our mining is not to be restricted, and a very great injustice thus done to the country. If we are to deviate from the regular order, and consider one item, because of the urgency of the case, I say emphatically that the case for wire-netting is not more urgent than that for many other items which might be referred to. I have nothing whatever to say against the very legitimate and praise-worthy desire on the part of honorable members whose constituents are vitally interested in the matter, to discuss the proposed duty on wire-netting as soon as possible. At the same time, in the electorate which I have had the honour to represent since the inauguration of the Commonwealth, thousands of people are compelled to pay from 2s. 6d. to 5s,  per week more than they had previously to pay on articles which cannot be made in this country. I take kerosene as an example. On the one hand we have the Standard Oil Trust, and on the other the British Imperial Company, which approaches us under the specious pretence that it is a British Trust, and ought, therefore, to be encouraged. I say that one Trust is just the same as another to me, and whether a man is called Rockefeller or John Smith does not affect me very much, especially when my constituents are called upon to pay an extra amount for their kerosene. I have no hesitation in saying that I do not care whether the Standard Oil Trust would be injured or not. I shall not readily support the proposed duty on kerosene. ' The pretence is that we should give employment to persons to make tins, while we know that the proposed duty may have the effect of throwing hundreds of people out of employment, carters, wharf labourers, and so on, who are entitled to just as much consideration, and no more, than is vouchsafed to others. Among the items to which, in my opinion, priority of treatment should be given, if we are to depart from the order of the schedule, are item 105, tea; items 106 and 107, apparel and attire; item 124, woollens; item 148, agricultural machinery; item 177, mining machinery; item 178, electrical machinery ; item 234, kerosene ; and item 352, magazines. I have not made up my mind what I shall do in regard to the duty on magazines, but importers have waited upon me, as I suppose they have waited upon other honorable members, pointing out the very great injustice--- </para>

                        <para>- The importers of magazines' have informed me that compliance with the requirements of the Tariff will ruin their businesses, and what is, perhaps, more serious, prejudicially affect the interests of thousands of news-agents and distributors. A magazine when stale is, I am told, something like a stale egg, practically unsaleable. It is only right that we should let those who are connected with the business of selling magazines know exactly what is to be done, because, as they point out, they have to give their orders months in advance to secure a regular supply. Shall I be in order in moving, as an amendment to the motion of the Minister, the addition of certain other items? I understand that I can only move that the consideration of all the items up to a certain item be postponed with a view to deal with that item. Am I right or wrong, sir? </para>

If it is desired to postpone the consideration of a number of items, with a view to dealing with particular items, I can see that it will lead to endless difficulty. If I may be permitted to make a suggestion, I would suggest, if it can be arranged, that the consideration of all the items be postponed until certain items have been dealt with.

                        <para>-  I rise to a point of order, sir. I understand your ruling to be that, in the event of a decision to postpone the consideration of all items up . to item  186,  it would then be impossible for the Committee to take into immediate consideration any items between the last item which has been passed and that item. There are certain honorable members who are prepared to take a decision on the question as to whether, in regard to item  187,  there is to be an alteration in the programme, and who, in the event of such a departure being agreed to, will want several other items to be considered. What I suggest is that on a word in the next item we should take a test vote as to whether the Committee is agreeable to proceed with the consideration of item  187.  If that course is taken, it will not block the consideration of any item between the last item which has been passed and the item which it is proposed to consider next. </para>

                        <para>-  I also desire to make a suggestion, sir. I do not sympathize with the position which the honorable and learned member for West Sydney is taking up, because I think that, in an- indirect way, he is endeavouring to prejudice those who wish the item of wire-netting to be taken. He must not expect me to share his desire, although there is a great deal to be said for several items which he has mentioned. It seems to me that the more convenient way to get at what he wishes will be, perhaps, to submit an amendment excepting from the operation of the motion certain items. The effect of that would be that the consideration of all items except those items would be postponed until after the item of wire-netting had been dealt with. I suggest, too, that the amendments in that direction should be taken separately. For instance, one honorable' member could move to except from the motion as many items as he liked, and a test division could be taken on the question as to whether the words proposed to be added should be added. The Committee, if it liked, could negative that amendment, and then, if it desired, it could negative the proposal to consider the item of wire-netting, but the first proposition would be to except the items the consideration of which the honorable and learned member wishes not to be postponed. </para>

                    <para>.- This matter ought to be dealt with very carefully and calmly. Last week the Treasurer said that he was in charge of the Tariff, and that he would not allow the business of the Committee to be taken out of his hands, or the sequence of the consideration of the Tariff to be altered. To-night, however, we find him quite willing to alter that sequence, although he has given a promise to the contrary to deputations who have from time to time waited upon him. The Treasurer, when certain suggestions were advanced from this side, made a great, display of courage, and went so far as to say that those who took a contrary view to himself on the question of giving preference to the consideration of certain items ought to go to the other side. On that occasion I expressed my appreciation of his determination in regard to the conduct of business. It will be remembered that the honorable gentleman did make a partial promise to consider the question, and in reply to the leader of the Opposition, he said that, after the tobacco duties had been disposed of, he would see whether an arrangement could be come to as to the precedence of, not one item, but several items. </para>

                        <para>- That promise was extracted from the Treasurer under duress, because he thought the numbers were against him, and the leader of the Opposition took advantage of the opportunity to press the item, of wire-netting to the front. To-day the Treasurer still has charge of public business, but he is willing to consent to postpone certain items in favour of wire-netting, so long as there is not a long discussion on the question of postponement. To my mind that attitude is an invitation to honorable members to enter upon a long discussion. The honorable gentleman has advanced no reasons why certain items shall be postponed; but he has charged certain honorable members with being " hysterical." In my opinion the honorable gentleman was, himself, hysterical when he said that he was a country member, and that was why he favoured giving precedence to the item of wire-netting. We now have the secret of the honorable gentleman's position. Country members whose constituents use wire-netting will naturally . vote for precedence being given to that item. The Treasurer has said that he will not permit any other items, except that which he has mentioned, to be considered, for the reason that he cannot get honorable members to agree as to the items to be selected. But if the Treasurer has his list of items, which he desires to have considered, why should not the honorable member for West Sydney, or myself, also have a little list? My own opinion is that the sequence of the Tariff should not be disturbed, because it appears to have been arranged with design. Those items which most nearly affect the public, or the revenue, have been placed first on the list, and only in one or two cases has that rule been departed from. Those who had the arrangement of the Tariff, have not picked out any particular trade or district for preferential treatment, but have grouped industries and commodities together in the order of those which affect the larger portions of the community. Why did those honorable members, who are interested in wire-netting, not move the postponement of the consideration of the duties on intoxicants and narcotics? We heard no suggestion in- that direction. I know that the Standing Orders are very stringent, but there is nothing to prevent my moving that all the items, up to item 188, for example, be postponed, and se* on right through the 444 items. The tobacco items represent a revenue of some ,£246,000, and it was quite right that they should be considered in their order. Why should not the items relating to groceries afterwards take precedence? All classes of the community are affected by them. The bulk of the people do not use wire-netting. Take, for instance, the item, " Currants." They are used in every household, and especially by the poorer classes. I find that £79&gt;°°° was derived, in revenue from them in 1906. The duty is to be increased. Rice also produced revenue to the extent of £80,000. Why should not precedence be given to the consideration of it? More people are interested in the duties on rice and currants than are interested in wire-netting. Then, again, revenue to the extent of £393,000 was derived from apparel and attire. Probably the Western Australian members would desire to consider the duties on mining machinery before we consider those on wire-netting. ' Why should not their desire be acceded to? The honorable member for West Sydney has said that he intends to support' the early consideration of those items which most largely affect his electors. I shall do the same. It is only natural that </para>

                </continue>
                <para class="block">Ave should take an interest in those items that especially concern our constituents. Wire-netting interests the country members in some degree, but I do not suppose that they are especially desirous of having the item considered before the other items are dealt with. There is no wire-netting industry in Victoria, although an attempt has been made to establish it at Pentridge. The Victorians think so much of it that it is to be conducted by prison labour. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know; but in New South Wales, wire-netting is not manufactured in gaol. Under the last Tariff, it was on the free list. Why was the industry ignored by the protectionists in 1902 ? We are told that the wire-netting industry involves the payment of wages to the extent of £12,000 a year. It has been doing very well, and yet under this new Tariff there is to be a stiff duty on the manufacture. I am not prepared to say that I shall vote for that duty. I think it-is too stiff. But there is no reason why the item should be taken before others, nor has any argument been adduced to show why it should be taken out of the regular order. I remember the honorable member for Cook saying that be would vote to place the necessaries of !ife on the lowest level, so far as duties are con'cerned. I should be prepared at the earliest possible moment to place them on the lowest possible level. It may be said that I am not conducing to that being done by the course that I am now taking. But I am urging that there is no reason for giving prior consideration to the products of any. particular industry. If we take this course in regard to wire-netting, there is not a single industry in Australia having friends amongst honorable members that will not make a demand for precedence. It is all very well for honorable members to say " Oh." If the right honorable member for Swan were engaged in an industry affected by the Tariff and saw preferential treatment extended to an item, he would be one of the first to ask that the item relating to his enterprise should be taken out of its order and dealt with- We shall be inundated with applications to deal with items out of their order. Petition after petition has been presented to the House from music teachers who desire us to deal without delay with the item of musical instruments. As a class, they are not highly paid, and if we agreed to this motion, why should they not ask for preferential consideration of the duty upon pianos? I am setting aside all pretence, and would point out that those who are supporting the motion are concerned in the wire-netting industry. </para>

                        <para>- For the most part they are. The item affects country electorates. The honorable member for Lang has no constituents interested in the duty on wire-netting, but in supporting this motion he may be actuated by a desire to conserve the interests of the State of which he is a representative. As a matter of fact, I do not think that State is so seriously affected by this question as he believes it to be. Why should this Tariff be "peacocked?" When the eyes of a country are picked out, it is often said that the land has been "peacocked" - and I object to the "peacocking " process being applied to the Tariff. According to the information put before us, the imports of wire-netting last year were of the value of £512,000, and it is anticipated that a revenue of £150,000 will be derived from the duty. </para>

                        <para>- And I wish the divisions relating to groceries and apparel to be dealt with.  There are many items which are more important than is that of wire-netting, and I protest against this proposal. If it be adopted, we shall never know when an item is to be taken out of its order. An honorable member may find that, during his temporary absence from the House, an item concerning which he possesses expert knowledge, has been dealt with. The engineering industry in my electorate is interested in the timber duties since it uses timber for pattern-making and other purposes, and those so engaged would have as much justification in asking that preference be given to the item of timber as have those who claim that the duty on wire-netting should now be taken. The mining industry is also affected by these items. The difficulties experienced by settlers in New South Wales in coping with the rabbit pest are materially reduced by the action of the State Government in importing wire-netting, and since the State Government receives three-fourths of the duty .paid upon its imports, the users of wire-netting will have to pay only one-fourth of the duty levied upon it. Thousands of rolls of wire-netting which were seized, as well as others, which have been taken out of bond have been distributed. </para>

                        <para>- Now that the Treasurer has moved for an alteration in the order of the items, I take it that I have a right, to present the claims of items other than wire-netting for consideration. Item No. 303, which deals with the timber duties, is a case in point. I mention the number to show that it is not a factious opposition that I am offering. I have studied the Standing Orders, and observed very closely standing order 276, so that I shall not be irrelevant in my remarks or guilty of tedious repetition. I emphasize the word "tedious." The timber duties are of great importance to my electorate, so far as engineering works are concerned. There are timber yards there also, all concerned in which would be glad to have the item dealt with quickly. Item 187 ' has a preference, in  any  case, to item 303, in the order of consideration, yet item 187 is to be taken out of its order. The timber industry requires a speedy settlement of the duties affecting it from the point of view of arrangements for supplies. And this reminds me of chairs. In item 301 ' the Government, propose to put upon the people of Australia a very severe tax of 7s. 6d. per chair. I am not saying whether the proposal is right or wrong, but surely the number of people who use chairs is greater than the number who require wire-netting. The poorer classes of' the community have to pay the heavy impost, because the chairs affected are not made in Japan or China, but are Austrian, British, and American, and made from a class of wood which cannot be obtained here. It is only natural that people throughout Australia should desire early treatment of that item. I have mentioned groceries, apparel, timber, and chairs, and I shall deal later with woollens. The Treasurer has intimated that he will not allow preferential consideration of any items, other than wire-netting. I believe that there are enough honorable members to carry, with the assistance of the Government, the motion, for the immediate consideration of that item. The honorable member for West Sydney struck the keynote when he asked " What about all the other items of great importance to the public?" The Treasurer's intimation means that any proposal to (rive priority of consideration to other items that affect the general public will be resisted by the Government, so that the meaning of  the Treasurer's motion is that only the users of wire netting are to receive special consideration. Wire-netting locally made is cheaper now in New South Wales than ever it has been. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know whether the Tariff is the cause or not, but in view of that fact, those who support this motion cannot argue that wire-netting is not obtainable cheaper on account of the Tariff. They say that the proposed duty is an impost upon the people, but if any people are paying this heavy impost they should not pay it a day longer, seeing that the locally-made wire-netting is cheaper than it ever was before. Yet all the other items in the schedule are to be put out of gear to allow this one to be considered. Another item - anti-corrosive paints - affects hundreds of people in my electorate. If honorable members advance arguments to relieve country districts of taxation, surely I have a right to point out that another item involves the immediate employment of 600 or 700, and at times  800,  men in my electorate. A heavy duty is proposed on anti-corrosive paints, which have to be imported. They are patented, and the peculiarities of their composition are such that they cannot be made here. The docking people in my electorate complain, and give specific cases of numbers of vessels that have had to leave Port Jackson and dock in Singapore and other Eastern ports, because of the heavy duty on these paints. Surely, then, I have a right on behalf of my electorate to ask for early consideration of the case of those 700 or 800 men, who are not employed at a very high rate of wage, and whose labour is intermittent. If they had high wages and constant employment, they would not feel so keenly the delay in dealing with the item, which is number 236 in the schedule. I should like to move afterwards that all items up to that one be postponed. The fact is that a number of honorable members are interested in country districts, or otherwise they would not allow the sequence of the Tariff to be altered at all to give priority to the item of wire-netting. They, are put in a very critical position, when the Treasurer tells them that they will get preferential consideration for wire-netting only. When the honorable gentleman said he would resist any other proposal of- the' kind, he meant that he would not allow the Committee to take the conduct of business out of his hands. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that he did. Another item involving articles of everyday ' consumption is that, of "Sago and tapioca," under " Groceries." There is an increase in the duty of nearly 100 per cent., which the majority of people who&gt; use those articles are paying every day. That item, in the ordinary course, would have received almost immediate consideration, as it comes early in the list. Why should the food of the masses be put aside until wire-netting is dealt with ? Candles also are used extensively throughout the Commonwealth. Why should the consideration of the duty upon that item be postponed in order to give precedence to that of wire-netting? The users of wire-' netting have not yet felt the impost upon that material. I know that other honorable members are equally anxious, . with myself, that the order of the Tariff shall not be disturbed, notably the representatives of Western Australia, who are keenly interested in the duties upon mining machinery. Why should the other items of the Tariff be deferred until the duty on wire-netting has been disposed of simply to convenience the pastoralists?" Again, I would point out that in 1906 the revenue derived from woollens was £300,000. Woollens are used by all classes of the community, and surely if a preference is to be given to the consideration of any articles it should be given to that. I believe that I am under-estimating the- position when I say that 800 men find employment in the painting of ships with anti-corrosive paints. Why should the interests of these men be ignored by honorable members considering out of its order the proposed duty upon wire-netting? The impost upon fishermen's netting is also, a serious one. Why should the interests of this class of the community be disregarded, especial lv as they are least able to withstand the burden ? If we begin to interfere with the order of the Tariff we shall be compelled to alter Its entire structure. It was designedly drafted7 with a view to enable the Government to ascertain as quickly as possible the position which they occupy in regard to its chief items. I therefore urge that they should not yield to the cry of any special class for special treatment. I move - </para>

                        <para>- Then I merely wish to say that at a subsequent stage I shall move to give precedence to the items, of timber, chairs and paints. The Treasurer has declared this afternoon that he would not allow the order of the Tariff to be varied if a long discussion upon the proposal took place. I hope the Government will not adopt such a course in the future. The order of the Tariff ought not to be interfered with. If we deviate from the order of the Tariff for the consideration of a particular item, the same course may be followed in connexion with other items, and honorable members from a distance, who are compelled to leave this State to reach their homes, may find that many items in which they are interested will be dealt with in their absence. If this course were to be permitted, honorable members of a captious disposition might, by moving the postponement of certain items until after others had been dealt with, hold up the Tariff for two or three years. I have no doubt we shall hear a big appeal on behalf of the struggling selector who is called upon to contend with the rabbits,, but I make an appeal on behalf of the poorest classes in the community, who have no deputations calling upon Ministers to influence them, to consider first Tariff items in which they are interested. I repeat here what I have said from many a platform, that if there is any justification for the doctrine of the free-trader, it is in the removal of duties of Customs from the absolute necessaries of life. I am not prepared to fight for the importer or for vested interests. While I am here to see fair play shown to manufacturers as well as importers,* I refuse to give the persons who use wire-netting special treatment in the consideration of the Tariff. The heavy impost of 7s. 6d. is proposed on chairs that are used bv the poorest of the poor, and a class of furniture for the manufacture of which our woods are not suitable. If the Committee had been asked to deal first with an item of that kind, there might have been some justification for such a proposal. I could understand the Labour Party supporting such a proposal as that, but I cannot understand them supporting a proposal for a prior consideration of the duty on wire-netting. The Government are agreeing to the course proposed under pressure. I admit openly that the wire-netting industry of New South Wales is not in my electorate, but many of the men engaged in the industry are constituents of mine. I have not put in a word for these men. In considering the last .Tariff, I supported the proposal to put wire-netting on the free list, but I have openly stated that I will not continue to do so. When I see other honorable members voting for duties in the interests of industries carried on in their districts, I say that the 400 men who are employed in the wire-netting industry in New .South Wales should receive some consideration. Are those who are supporting the proposal that wire-netting should be first considered prepared to carry the duty proposed ? </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. The Barton Administration may have consented to put wire-netting on the free list because the right honorable member for Adelaide was stronger than <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. R.</inline> E. O'Connor, and the present Treasurer, who were representatives in the Cabinet, of New South Wales. This was the only industry of importance in New South Wales that was neglected at that time. I asked the question how it was that the three representatives of New South Wales in the Government neglected this New South Wales industry. Either they wished to neglect it, or the right honorable member for Adelaide was the master mind. The reason now appears to be that wire-netting is largely used in South Australia and in Victoria, and is not made in either of those States, though we hear it is shortly to be made at pentridge gaol. I can understand that representatives of the southern States are prepared to press the consideration of this item, because they intend to attempt a drastic reduction of the proposed duty. While I do not say that I will vote for the duty proposed, T shall give a protection to the industry which I was never prepared to give it before. When I find that other industries are being coddled and protected, I do not see why this New South Wales industry should not be treated in the same way. I indorse what has been said by the honorable member for West Sydney, and I look to many honorable members of a radical turn of mind to assist us in this matter. I can understand country members being concerned about this item, but most of the orders for wire-netting have been placed, and I ask them to permit us to go on with the consideration of Tariff items which affect the masses of the community. I do not see why we should be specially anxious to. assist honorable members who desire to cut down a duty in the interest of a special few, who are mainly the pastoralists of Australia. I trust the Treasurer will see the advisability of withdrawing his motion, and that in future he will not allow anything to interfere with the consideration of the items' seriatim. </para>

                    <para>.- I address myself to the question in the hope that by doing so I shall facilitate the very early determination of it. The country is waiting earnestly and anxiously for the settlement of the Tariff. I believe it was proposed in good faith that we should first consider the item of wire-netting, and some few other items, with a view to their early settlement in the best interests of the country. We now find that, so far from the adoption of that course being likely to facilitate what is desired, it is likely .to retard it. This discussion, for all practical purposes, is absolutely useless, and I shall not be surprised to hear a serious expression of indignation against this waste of time, which might be usefully spent in the consideration of Tariff items. I do not say that it is the intention of any honorable member to cause delay, but that is the effect of this discussion. I, therefore, plead with the Committee to allow the schedule to be dealt with item by item, because, in my opinion, that is the most expeditious way of getting through it. Probably the wire-netting item will be reached sooner if we resolve at once to deal with all the preceding items in their order, than if we 'continue what appears to be an interminable debate upon the proposal to give priority of consideration to it, and to certain other items. As I rarely occupy time in speaking, I feel justified in appealing to honorable members, if they must discuss the motion,, to do so as briefly as possible; and, if they can, to refrain from speaking, and let us come to a division at once. </para>

I do not know why honorable members have taken so long to express their views on this motion. Why should the wire-netting item be considered before any other ? The proposed duty on wire-netting is only 25 per cent., while the duty on some articles is as high as 700 per cent. ; yet we are not being asked to give priority to them. In ray opinion, the sooner we get to work on the schedule as printed, taking the items in the order in which they appear in it, the more credit shall we obtain, and the better will it be for the commercial interests of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>. - It seems to me that the Government has discovered a new way to block the Tariff, and is putting its supporters in an unfortunate position. In my opinion, the wire-netting item should be dealt with in, its turn. If I voted' for the motion, would the Treasurer go to my constituency to explain why the duty on wire-netting was dealt with- before the duty on kerosene? I represent one of the poorest districts in South Australia. Although there are gasworks there, comparatively few of the homes are lighted with gas, kerosene being used in its stead. Kerosene is also of more importance to the farmer and producer than is wire-netting. If the producers are suffering because they cannot get wire-netting cheaply enough,, why do not the Governments of the States say, " We will remit the duty to you, because three-fourths of it will ultimately be handed back to you." I cannot conceive of anything weaker than the present position of the Government. The Treasurer says, " I am prepared «to deal with one item in advance, if the Committee decides that it shall be dealt with out of its order." </para>

                        <para>- The proposal came from honorable members who will not be found supporting the Tariff. The Treasurer should stand by his Tariff. Deputations have waited upon me, and shoals of letters have been sent to me, asking that various items shall be dealt with first, in order that those connected with certain industries may know how to conduct their business. But how. could' I meet my constituents if I allowed the Government, as a splendid political step, according to their -opponents, to give- special consideration to wire-netting, by taking the wire-netting item before these other items? Too much attention is paid to the producer; it is time that we did something for the poorer sections of the community. I shall vote for reduced rates in regard to many lines ; but if we are to make any reductions, we should deal first with duties which press heavily on the poor. The duty on wire-netting does not affect the poor residing in our. cities and towns. But the manner in which they are robbed by the kerosene trust is astounding. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt the honorable member, who represents a country constituency, will get kudos for supporting the proposal to give first consideration to the duty on wire-netting. But my constituents are not affected by it. I therefore ask him to facilitate the consideration of a duty which affects both my constituents and his, the duty on kerosene. We have heard of the way in which the farmer is robbed by the duties on textiles, groceries, and other articles of consumption. Surely the duty on wire-netting is a bagatelle to those imposts, and honorable members who are so desirous of helping the producer should deal first with them. I am astonished that Ministers should allow themselves to be brow-beaten by the press, the Opposition, and the ex-Premier of New South Wales. I shall not follow them in this proposal. Strong representations have been made to me as to the injury which will be inflicted on some of our industries if the proposed duty on corks is carried. Every honorable member must admit that . it is unlikely that corks will be produced in Australia for many years to come. This does not apply to one industry, but to all those industries which are engaged in putting up medicines, wines, and beer. Why should not they be considered, especially when we know that in whatever form the Tariff may be passed there is very little likelihood of a majority imposing high duties on an article which cannot possibly be manufactured in Australia ? </para>

                        <para>-  I do not think the honorable member will get to a division on this proposal for some time to come. Perhaps it suits the district which he represents. But there are a good many honorable members who come from other parts of the Commonwealth which are interested in other items. But if honorable members sit here dumb and simply vote for or against the motion, they will find it very awkward to explain their action. At this stage, I think it is quite sufficient for me to protest against the action of the Government, and to endeavour, as I have done, to show that, if precedence is to be given to any items, it should be to those items in which people who are suffering most, and are least able to defend themselves, are interested. Those people, certainly, are not the producers who require wire-netting, and who cannot get it unless they pay a little more for it at the present, time, considering that the extra payment could easily be remitted by the various States Governments. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member for Hindmarsh has, I think, destroyed  the effect of his speech and his logic bv his ardour and vehemence. The honorable member has spoken with more warmth on this technical question than I have observed on his part on any previous occasion. It seems to me that he had a pretty strong case, and that he would have presented it better if he had not shown so much party spirit. </para>

It so happen"!that the manufacture of wire-netting is carried on in my constituency, and not withstanding - I shall not say " therefore," because it may be a coincidence - I am willing to reduce the duty, recognising as I do that one of the primary industries depends on the price of this particular article,- not merely from the point of view of individual considerations, but as affecting the employment of a very large number of people in the country districts. There are no farms in my constituency, which is composed of thickly populated suburbs. I do not suppose a rabbit can be seen there from one year's end to the other, except in poulterers' shops. At the same time, all of us must consider the big industries of the country ; that is why I am in favour of giving precedence to items like that of wire-netting and mining machinery. </para>

                        <para>- Because I think that the items of wire-netting and mining machinery have a sort of geometrical effect on the industries which they represent. Those who know anything of mining - and I speak moire particularly of Western Australia - are aware that many mining enterprises are depending entirely on the question whether mining machinery is or is not to be admitted free, or with a small duty. What are called " low grade " enterprises are hanging in the balance, and hundreds and thousands of men are awaiting employment pending the decision of that question. There is no need for warmth, because this is  a  cold economic question. The honorable member for Hindmarsh has insisted on the tremendous hardship inflicted on his constituents because of the dutv on kerosene. That duty is 3d. per gallon ; and in  a  small household a gallon will probably last a fortnight or a month. It would appear, therefore, that, for the purpose of saving three-halfpence a fortnight, or, it may be, a month, in a small household, we should now refrain from dealing immediately with certain items on which the employment of hundreds and thousands of men depend, and to whom the delay mav involve, not three-halfpence per week, but their whole means of supporting their families. I desire the honorable member for Hindmarsh to see what an ineffective comparison he has instituted. </para>

                        <para>- One would think 'that the item of kerosene was the only one the honorable member could quote, and that it was proposed to postpone indefinitely all the items of daily necessities. We desire to deal with all the items in the Tariff, but most of us pay some regard to the interests of the large primary industries. In selecting the mining industry as an illustration, I am not considering my own constituency, within 50 or 100 miles of which there is not a mine. Strange to say, the industry of wire-netting manufacture, the item in relation to which I urge should be dealt with quickly, is carried on in my constituency ; and I have no doubt I shall incur the displeasure of a large number of people by seeming to desire to remove the tentative duty from the commodity on which their industry is wrongly supposed to depend. </para>

I think that the method which has been adopted of piling amendment on amendment is the longest way round. It seems to me that it would be perfectly open to an honorable member to move that all the items prior to wire-netting should be postponed until after that item has been considered, and that when that had been disposed of, it would be equally open to any other honorable member to move that the whole of the items as they then stand should be postponed until after some other selected item had been disposed of. </para>

Just as the Government frequently postpone item after item on the business-paper, sometimes twice or three times in succession, I think we could move the postponement of the whole of the items until after that of mining machinery, and then the Committee would have an opportunity of saying whether or not they would agree to that course. If the Committee did agree, it would be a clear indication that- honorable members thought it desirable to deal with each of such items before other items. </para>

It would then be open to any honorable member to move the postponement of all the items which stand prior to some other item. The Committee would then have the advantage of saying whether or not they thought the item was of sufficient importance to justify the postponement of other items, and thus we might get through the half-dozen or more items which certain honorable members seem desirous to have first considered. If there is any way of getting round your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> I should be very glad to secure for the Committee an opportunity of dealing with the items in the way I have suggested. </para>

At any rate, he stirred my blood sufficiently to make me get up and say that I am here to speak for the people in my electorate.

                        <para>- The young crops are beginning to grow, and the farmers are anxious about them. Does not the honorable member know that a great deal of the fencing work is done by young farmers? Yet he is protesting against this question being settled immediately. I cannot understand the objection to disposing of it as speedily as possible. Spring has arrived, and the young rabbits are spreading throughout the country. Although we have enjoyed a long period of prosperity there is now a danger of drought, and it is urgently necessary that wire fencing should be put up to keep out the rabbits. I do not often find occasion to say that what the Government are doing is right, but on this occasion I think they are doing right in proposing that the duty on wire-netting shall be considered immediately. I therefore give them my cordial support. </para>

                    <para>.- In view of the fact that a number of items have been put forward for special consideration, I also desire to propose that item 177, Mining Engines and Machinery, n.e.i., item 178, Electrical Machinery, item 179, Electrical and Gas Appliances, and item 180, Electrical Materials, be considered as' early as possible. I am credibly informed that a great deal of the electrical mining machinery required in the mines cannot be manufactured in Australia. We have not the plant to make it. I am also informed by a mine manager that the present Tariff would leave him out of pocket to the extent of about ,£3,000 in respect to electrical machinery. In his mines electricity furnishes the whole of the motive power, because wood has become so scarce. There is no honorable member who is more anxious to see the duty on- wire-netting settled than I am. I think that every honorable member is in sympathy with the men who are struggling against the abominable rabbit pest. They are having a very hard fight. Some months ago I paid a special visit to the heart of one of the districts where the people are coping with the rabbits, and some of the settlers told me that at times they were in such despair that they asked themselves : "Is it worth while to continue the struggle or not? Shall we go in for the rabbit industry, and drop the wool industry ? " I shall be very pleased to see the matter dealt with as early as possible, though it seems to me that the Government have made a mistake in proposing to depart from the order of the schedule. I think that any honorable member who is an expert in regard to any particular item is justified in giving reasons why he thinks it necessary that that item should be dealt with as early as possible. But it appears to me, nevertheless, that complications will be brought about by taking wire-netting out of its order. With regard to the item itself, we have had the statement that wire-netting has already been reduced in price. </para>

                    <para>. - I came 'here this afternoon with the understanding that the Government intended to propose special treatment for six or seven items in the schedule. That was the distinct understanding on which we left off business last week. But, during the week-end - shall I say in consequence of criticisms from the Ministerial corner as well as of criticisms from the Opposition </para>

                        <para>- There seems to have been a singular and mysterious change in regard to the attitude of the Government. Now .we are asked to give precedence to one item only. I believe - indeed I urged last week - that we should give special treatment to wire-netting because of the urgency attaching to it. I imagined, in my simplicity, that three or four items of an equally urgent character would be treated likewise. I understand that it has been borne in upon the mind of the Government recently, and particularly upon the mind of the Minister of Trade and Customs, that there are a number of anomalies in the new Tariff which, the sooner they are rectified the better it will be for the people of the country, and the Tariff itself. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know why the Treasurer is consenting to precedence being given to the item, unless he is prepared, to consider a proposal to reduce the duty. There are other items of a specially anomalous character. The duties on timber are particularly obnoxious. I visited some of the fruit-growing districts in my constituency on Saturday last, and although Ministers may talk as they please about these special proposals, I found that, whereas a gin-case used to cost is., it now costs1s. 4d., and that bushel fruit-cases that used to cost 6d. are now 9d. each. That is a tax that ought not to be allowed to remain on that industry for one moment longer than is absolutely necessary. In fixing the schedule, the Government have torn up the arithmetical tables. In connexion with the timber duties, they have provided that a board a quarter of an inch thick shall be regarded, for the purposes of assessing duty, as being1 inch thick. Anything under1 inch in thickness is to be regarded as being an inch thick. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. The Government have adopted a standard of their own, which upsets the arithmetical tables to which we have been accustomed. The anomaly to which I have just referred is one which I should think no honorable member will attempt to defend. These specially anomalous items might very well have preferential treatment. The Tariff could not be in any way prejudiced by a number of these items, which Ministers themselves are agreed must be modified, being selected for preferential treatment. I specially refer, in this connexion, to the duties on timber and wire-netting. Then again, there is the duty on bottles. A double tax is being imposed upon the importers and the people of Australia generally in regard to bottles. In future, when a man imports pickles, he will have to pay a duty, not only on the pickles, but on the bottles as well, so that duplicate imposts are being levied on these articles. </para>

                        <para>- He told us very plainly that he would not be bound by the recommendations of any section of the Commission, and that he paid very little heed to the Commission' as a whole; yet, when anomalies in the Tariff are pointed out, who are so ready to shelter themselves behind the Commission as the Ministers responsible for those anomalies? However, the anomalies are in the Tariff, and we point them out, as deputation after deputation has pointed them out, to the Government. The Minister should be glad of the opportunity furnished by the Committee to rectify them at the earliest moment. I say nothing about the duty on magazines, to which reference has been made by the honorable member for West Sydney. He spoke of the literature in imported magazines as being comparable to stale eggs. However stale literature may be, I think that it is a stretch of the imagination to compare magazines a month or two old with stale eggs; only a. rhetorician of. the brilliant qualities of the honorable member for West Sydney would make such a comparison. I shall support, in every way, the selection of a reasonable number - say, half-a-dozen - of the most anomalous items in the Tariff for preferential treatment at the present stage. </para>

                    <para>-- The Government have been very unfairly treated in regard to this matter. They have been appealed to by every section of the Committee to do what they now propose, and some of the speeches delivered this afternoon have certainly surprised me. When, a few days ago, it was suggested that preference should be given to the item of wire-netting, it was urged that it was necessary to deal at once with the division relating to tobacco, since, pending its settlement, a number of men would remain out of employment. My contention is that thousands of miles of fencing, which would give employment to a large number of men, remain in abeyance, pending the decision of Parliament regarding the duty on wire-netting. The Government have not been treated fairly in connexion with this proposal. They did not care about adopting the suggestion, and only took the item out of its order because of its urgency, and " because of pressure brought' to bear upon them by all sections, of the Committee. I admit that there are a number of other duties equally burdensome, and in many instances affecting more people, but they do not stand out with the same prominence as this particular duty does. The people affected by this duty have also to bear the burden of all the other duties which have been mentioned, but this item affects their very means of livelihood. As the result of the use of superphosphates, thousands upon thousands of acres of vermin-infested country have been brought into use that were not in use before, but without wire-netting the farmers might as well throw their money into the sea as attempt to go on. Yet in this deliberative assembly the proposal has been treated this afternoon in a most cavalier spirit. It has not been an honest debate, and the amendments moved have been tabled with the deliberate purpose of causing confusion. Those who proposed them said that it was not their intention to move to reduce the duties on the items with which they dealt. </para>

                        <para>- A number said that they did not. I am rather astonished at the attitude of the honorable member for Dalley. On the last occasion when the duty on wire-netting was considered, he was among those who fought in the forefront to put the article on the free list, because it was a necessity. I trust that the Committee will stand by the Government, and allow us to get on with the Tariff. </para>

They Have, therefore, reason to complain of the speeches made this afternoon - some of them delivered by their friends. </para>

It does not speak well for the Committee that this should have happened, seeing that this Tariff, as a whole, is the most burdensome to the whole of the people that has ever been submitted in Australia. The people are fairly groaning under its burdens, and yet no desire is evidenced by some honorable members to get to close quarters with it and to settle the question of whether it is to be a high Tariff or whether some-' moderate reductions are to be made in it. I have refrained to-day from speaking up till now, although I was very much tempted to do so by a number of the speeches which have been delivered. My anxiety is to get on with the Tariff, in order that we may place business on a sound footing, that those concerned may know what they ' are doing, and that some finality may bereached as to what the duties are to be. </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps the honorable member does. There are, however, a very small percentage of loafers in my constituency. My constituents are nearly all workers, and I hope the same applies to the honorable member's constituency. Whilst there are a great number of electors in his constituency interested in wire-netting, there are a very great number of electors in mine interested in altogether different items. If there is one constituency in Australia that is not going to reap any appreciable benefit - at all events immediately - from a highly protective Tariff, it is Kalgoorlie. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad to hear that the honorable member for Grey endeavoured to assist the people of Kalgoorlie. Whether he achieved his object or not is another question. I deplore the action that has been taken by the Government this afternoon. I frankly admit that a good deal of what the honorable member for Grey says is quite true, and that the Minister has been approached from different sides of the Committee with the object of getting this item placed in a prominent position on the list. But, although that is so, no obligation is thrown upon those honorable members who have resisted the proposal, and who believe that it is not going to save time, to sit silent and allow a proposition which they believe to be contrary to the expeditious conduct of business to pass without question. This is "about the only matter upon which I have ventured an opinion during the discussion on the Tariff. Any departure from the order in which the items appear on the list will inevitably occupy more time in debate as to which item should be taken first than would be occupied if those items were reached in the ordinary course of events. It looks like it, at any rate. After we have debated this question for a few hours more, it will probably look even more like it. This is one of those junctures when it is absolutely essential for those who hold a particular view to express their opinions in no uncertain language. If we start out on a correct basis now, thoroughly debate the matter, test the question on wire-netting, and then test the question on several other items that will undoubtedly be brought forward if wire-netting is to be considered- </para>

From the stand-point,of their relative importance, there is no . justification whatever for postponing the consideration of other items in order to give precedence to that of wire-netting. An extraordinary anxiety to cope with the rabbit pest appears to have been engendered during the past month or so. I am assured that Messrs. Lysaght Brothers are capable of manufacturing 350 miles of wire-netting per week. ' In other words, they are quite able to supply all the requirements of Australia in this connexion. </para>

                        <para>- The interests of the consumer are second to no other interests in the Commonwealth. In my judgment,1 the duty upon kerosene presses more heavily upon the poorer classes than does any other duty levied under the Tariff. If we are going to depart from the order of the. schedule, we should certainly give precedence to- the item . of kerosene. I do not. think that the duty upon that article is second in importance to the impost upon wire-netting. Then, my own constituency is vitally interested in the duties collected upon mining machinery'. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. I have been advised by the Kalgoorlie Chamber of Mines that if the Tariff be passed in its present form, it will increase the expenses of the Western Australian mines by  £70,000  per annum. Bearing in mind the small margin of profit upon which some mining companies have to work in their treatment of highly refractory ores, I say that the duties upon some mining machinery which cannot be obtained in Australia is of more importance than is the duty upon wire-netting. A larger number of persons are interested in this item than in wire-netting, and as a representative of  a  mining constituency, which will receive very little benefit from the Tariff, I am justified in saying that this item should receive consideration equal to that given to any other. If there is to be an alteration in the order in which the items are to be considered, the Committee will have an opportunity of testing the importance of the item affecting mining machinery. In this connexion, also, I may refer to the proposed increase of the duty on  Oregon  timber from 6d. to  is.  6d. per  100  feet. No doubt the object in view, that Australian timber may be more largely used in mining, is a most laudable one, but the safety of life in connexion with the mining industry renders the use of  Oregon  timber for mining purposes in some districts almost essential. </para>

                        <para>- That is a laudable ambition, but I remind the honorable member, who represents a farming constituency,  and  is naturally interested in wire-netting,  that  those whose lives depended on the merits or demerits of timber used in the industry which they follow, have  been  able to get Australian timber without having to pay a duty on it, and yet have preferred' to use a timber on which they have had to pay duty. If the proposed duty is imposed on  Oregon  timber, those who have been using it for mining purposes may be induced, at the risk of life, to use a timber that is entirely unsuitable, and this may lead to disaster. I am not in favour of anything of that kind, and if other items are to be taken out of their turn, it may fairly  be contended that the proposed duty on  Oregon  timber is one deserving of special consideration. Then there is an increase in the duty on agricultural machinery from  12 <inline font-style="italic">\</inline> to  20  per cent. That is an imposition on the great primary industry which the honorable member for Wimmera is so anxious to serve, and  I  have no doubt that, if he went into figures, he could show that the amount involved in connexion with that item is of greater consequence to the farmers than the amount involved in the proposed duty on wire-netting. Then there is the duty proposed on magazines. We have had deputations in connexion with it, and have been advised that if the present Tariff rate is continued on magazines, the result will be to cripple or ruin one great importing and distributing house, and to seriously affect the interests of the numerous vendors of magazines throughout the Commonwealth. We had a similar proposal submitted in connexion with magazines in considering the Tariff some time ago, and if personal interests might be imported into the debate, the case made out by the importing house referred to is as strong as that which might be made out in connexion with many other items. But the question we have to ask is whether the case submitted is sufficient to warrant interference with the whole of the proposals of the Government in the interests of the country. I" might refer to many other items, such as chairs, candles, blue, and to the  20  per cent, duty proposed on fire extinguishers. If the item of wire-netting is to be given precedence, I feel that an obligation will be thrown on the Committee to take a division on the question of giving preference to every one of the items I have enumerated. I repeat that this is the worst possible means that could have been adopted to procure a speedy settlement of the Tariff. We might have got through a number of divisions of the Tariff in the time which has been taken up in this discussion. </para>

                        <para>- We would have got a long way towards- it, and we have not yet taken a division on a single item of the Tariff to-night. There is sufficient interest behind the items to which other speakers as well as myself have referred, to demand a division on the question of giving them precedence also. I hope the Government will see that the course now proposed to be adopted is a mistaken one, and is likely to lead to tedious debates and divisions to secure precedence for other items in which people are interested. </para>

                    <para>.- Had there been any prospect of the Committee doing any other business to-night, I should not have attempted to speak. I have been waiting somewhat impatiently , to get on with different items of the Tariff, but I am afraid we are not likely to touch them tonight. The debate, however, has not been without result. I have listened to it for the greater part of the night, and it has shown me the absolute impossibility of the Committee definitely' deciding that there are items which we can proceed with in preference to others. One honorable member has given us very good reasons for the selection of certain items, and another for the selection of other items, and if we accepted what has been said to-night as proving the need for urgent treatment of the items named, we should pick out a great many items, and deal with the Tariff in a higgedly-piggedly fashion, although by going straight through the schedule we could dispose of our work much more quickly. Until I had heard this discussion, I was under the impression that half-a-dozen items could fairly be selected for advance consideration, but the Government made a serious mistake in suggesting preference for the wire-netting item alone. What has been said in favour of that course could be urged with equal force in regard to many other items. If any particular duty is inflicting a definite and unavoidable hardship, it is undoubtedly that on magazines. I do not know why the Government imposed it, unless in excessive zeal for the protection of the literary talent of Australia. I think that public opinion is in favour of mingling with Australian literary productions a proportion from outside, and, so far as the public demand affords a criterion, the local productions are not at present sufficient. Therefore, consideration might well be given to the unfortunate importers of magazines in preference to persons affected by the other items which have been mentioned. I ask, too, how will the picking out of items fit in with the proposal to send the Tariff to the Senate in divisions, to accelerate the work of Parliament, and enable us to get back to our constituencies within a reasonable period. Looking at the matter as impartially as I can, I think that we shall be well advised if we continue the consideration of the Tariff in the order of its schedule. If, when doing so, honorable members are as brief as possible, we, who come from distant States, may be able, before the year is out, to make an appearance in our constituencies for the benefit of those who wonder why we find Melbourne so attractive that we spend little time with them, or even in the States which we represent. I hope that the Government will drop the proposal to give special treatment to the wire-netting item. </para>

                        <para>- I am not aware that a promise was given. The Treasurer may have made a more or less indefinite statement, but, after the discussion which has taken place, he should reconsider the position, and admit the unfairness of taking any one item out of its order. I challenge him, or any other honorable member, to mention half-a-dozen items as urgent which could not be balanced by another half-dozen of equal urgency. Therefore, as sensible men, we should recognise that we can get through our work most quickly by dealing with the items as they . stand in the schedule. </para>

                    <para>.- I understand that the Treasurer has promised to give first consideration to the wire-netting item, and, therefore, I point out that if that item alone is dealt with, and the duty is reduced, the local manufacturers will be placed in an unfortunate position, because there is a duty of 10 per cent. on. wire, n.e.i., and the wire used to make netting comes chiefly from America. </para>

                    <para>.- If honorable members are anxious to divide, I am prepared to resume my seat. My chief object in rising is to suggest that after all the debate which has taken place further discussion is not likely to influence a vote. What we want to ascertain is whether a majority of honorable members are in favour of differentiating with regard to the consideration of the items. I think it would have been better if, say, half-a-dozen items had been selected for prior consideration. If I may be permitted to use the expression, we are not getting any "forader." Desirous as I am of seeing the item of wire-netting dealt with right away, I intend to support the motion of the Minister. I ask honorable members to allow a vote to be taken at once. </para>

                    <para>. - I am not wanting in sympathy with the farmers. For some years I lived in a farming district, and had the honour of being secretary to a Farmers and Settlers' Association for about three years, so that I know exactly how the rabbit pest affects their interests. I have listened very carefully to the remarks of the honorable member for Parkes and others who have spoken in favour of the item of wire-netting being taken before other items. I certainly did not expect to hear a case made out for the motion by the Acting Prime Minister. He did not attempt to show any reasons why the item of wire-netting should be taken first. He simply submitted the motion in order to redeem his promise to afford to the Committee an opportunity of saying whether it desired that' item to be taken first or not. </para>

                        <para>- I may not have been present when they were given, but certainly in this debate no one has shown why the item of wire-netting should be taken before other items. In view of that fact, especially when I remember the ability of some of those who have been urging that the item should be taken first, my conclusion is that there are no reasons to be adduced in favour of the motion. </para>

                        <para>- In endeavouring to make out his case, the honorable member ought to have been careful to verify the statement, and given other reasons in favour of the motion. The only State in which any noise about the duty on wire-netting has been made is New South Wales. The question has been raised there largely for electioneering purposes, and it has been raised here by some honorable members as a mere electioneering placard. </para>

                        <para>- I do not suppose the honorable member is anticipating a Federal election just now, but later on honorable members opposite expect to be able to use their speeches on this motion in order to hoodwink the farmer, and make him believe that they are the men to save the country. I have some facts and figures in connexion with the importation of wire-netting into New South Wales. Prior to the introduction of the Tariff on the 9th August, 42,048 rolls of wire-netting had been imported and passed through the Customs free this year. Since the introduction of the Tariff, there have been imported 16,062 rolls. Each roll contains about 100 yards each, so that less than 1,000 miles have been brought to New South Wales. </para>

                        <para>- Lysaght Brothers turn out about 335 miles of wire-netting per week, so that the wire-netting imported by New South Wales represents about three weeks' work; and  yet we have all this noise created in New South Wales about the duty on wire-netting. The amount of 'duty collectable on the 16,062 rolls is £5,827, of which the three-fourths returnable to New South Wales is estimated at £4,529&gt; though it is believed by the Federal Government that, probably, £247 over and above that three-fourths will be returned to the State. We' find, therefore, that the New South Wales Government will have to pay only a net amount of less than £1,000 in duty; and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Perry,</inline> a member of the New South Wales Government, has, within the last few days, issued a circular stating that his Government intend to deduct from the price to the farmer the amount that is returnable by the Federal Government. As a matter of fact, on the total quantity of wire-netting introduced since the Tariff was pre- , sented, the duty amounts to less than £1,000, spread over the primary producers of New South Wales. </para>

                        <para>- In view of the proposal of the New South Wales Government to repay the returnable proportion of the revenue from the duty to the purchasers, merchants who imported wire-netting would be nothing short of lunatics. When I compare the amount of duty represented by the importations of wire-netting with the dutv represented by other items in the Tariff, I am somewhat amused at the action of honorable members who would have us believe that they are desirous of removing taxation from the poorer people in the community. For instance, duty to the amount of £13,416 was collected on sago and tapioca last year. Why should that item not take precedence over wire-netting? </para>

                        <para>- Yes. On coffee, duty . to the amount of £20,973 was collected last year; and yet this is supposed to be not so important as the £1,000 duty, due on wire-netting. Last year the duty paid on currants was £79,257 ; on matches, £41,583; on preserved milk, £44,999 ; on rice, under one heading, £53,528, and under another heading, £47,613; and on fish, £64,074 - a total taxation of close upon £350,000, which affects most seriously the working classes. </para>

                        <para>-I understand the wire-netting is of the same gauge. I contend that there is not the pressing urgency in connexion with wire-netting that there is in connexion with the other items of daily consumption I have mentioned. Not a solitary reason has been advanced for giving precedence to wire-netting; and I should not feel justified in supporting any proposal to take the items out of their order. By adhering to the Tariff as placed before us, we shall more readily reach those items which deal with the necessaries of life, and in which the great masses of the people are vitally interested. </para>

                    <para>. - The subject under consideration is one of vital importance to the people in my  electorate. I- refrained from taking part in the debate earlier, because I hoped to have an opportunity to speak on the main question. But I now recognise that it is impossible to reach the item to-night. Some honorable members have manifested a fearful and wonderful desire to speak all round the Tariff without reaching the main issue. I do not suppose that if the present objection to an immediate consideration of the duty on wire-netting had not been taken, we should by this time have been any nearer to the point at which we are aiming, because some other issue would have been raised, which would have caused delay. I hold that the Government are not only meeting the wishes of a large number of honorable members, but are endeavouring to consult the interests of the Commonwealth in proposing to bring forward the item at an early stage of the debate upon the Tariff. Of course, I recognise that there are other items which are of primary importance. </para>

                        <para>- It is of no use regretting the impossible. The honorable member who interjects has advocated that special consideration should be given to kerosene. The people of my electorate are as vitally interested in that' item as are those of his constituency. There is no heed to enter into the history of the rabbit invasion, but some honorable members have failed to realize that the rabbit evil has extended from the purely pastoral areas into the agricultural districts, and that unless special efforts are made to assist the farmers to protect their holdings, the whole country will suffer. City men, like the honorable member for Dalley, seem to think that this is a question of minor importance. But they will soon discover that unless the rabbit pest is coped with the very source of the wealth of this community will be dried up. I was astonished to hear honorable members urging that the whole Tariff, with its 444 items, should be taken as it stands, and that no precedence should -be given to major over minor items. In my opinion, the whole debate would be demoralized by such a proceeding. We should have the important items wedged in amongst' a number of minor importance. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, and in regard to this very matter. In 1902, the general duties affecting the iron duties were postponed for the purpose of giving consideration to wire-netting.  I do not understand how the honorable member for Cook, with his knowledge of country conditions, can fail to appreciate the reason why the Government of New South Wales, departing from the policy of non-interference in commercial matters, entered into competition with private enterprise in the importation of wire-netting. Does not the honorable member think that, before any Government would take such a drastic step, it would .have urgent reasons behind it? They did it for the purpose of assisting the primary producer. </para>

                        <para>- I hold that this is  a matter of primary importance in connexion with our food supplies. I know men in mv electorate who have cultivated their land for thirty-five years without loss from rabbit destruction. But during the last two years they have practically lost all that they have put into the land, not through drought, but through destruction by rabbits. Last year they had to buy fodder in Svdney, at a very high price, to feed their stock - not because their fodder crops failed, but because . the rabbits ate them.  Some honorable members do not seem to realize the seriousness of the position. Surely, however, they must see that the State Government would not have taken the drastic action that it did in connexion with this question had there not been something urgent behind it. They imported wire-netting for the purpose of obtaining it as cheaply as possible for the use of men who are compelled to protect their holdings. If the Government could have bought it from Lysaghts directly, or from any other manufacturers within the Commonwealth equally cheaply, they would have done so. On making inquiries at leading warehouses, I found that Messrs. Lysaght Brothers would not supply, small land-owners with wire-netting; that they had to be supplied by the warehouses, and that the squatters who were prepared to place large orders with the firm were told that their orders could not be executed for nine or twelve months. When the Government introduced the Tariff, I obtained from leading Sydney houses quotations for wire-netting on behalf of my constituents, and found that Lysaght Brothers' A and B brands were, being retailed in Sydney at from £40 to £45 per mile. On the other hand, the Government were supplying for £26 per mile imported wire-netting equal to, if not better than, that manufactured by Lysaght Brothers, and retailed at £40 per mile. An honorable member has told us that Lysaght Brothers have reduced their prices by £1 per mile. That is a mere bagatelle. Even with such a reduction the price of Lysaght Brothers' netting would be considerably in excess of that charged by the Government for imported netting, plus the duty. Honorable members are anxious to look after the interests of the workers engaged in the industry. A few months ago there appeared in the newspapers reports showing that men were working for Lyiaght Brothers at sweating wages. Experts received only about £2 per week, and the remuneration of others was so low that they went on strike. Many of them, failing to secure the desired terms, sought other avocations rather than return to the factory under the old conditions. </para>

                        <para>- I do. The Government have been forced by the conditions obtaining in New South Wales to import wire-netting. Finding that the importers and manufacturers, taking advantage of the demand for wire-netting, had put up the price, and that in this way the wealth of the country was being sapped at its source, the Government determined to step in and assist the primary producers by making direct importations. Only one step has to be taken from State importation to the State manufacture of netting. </para>

                        <para>- So long as good work is done, I do not think that there will be any objection on that score. The primary producers, at all events, will be assisted by the adoption of the course proposed by the Government of Victoria. Those who say that this matter is not urgent argue against evidence submitted to them every day by means of deputations, circulars, and other representations. Only to-day, I handed to the Treasurer a sheaf of communications that I had received from representative bodies of all" kinds in my electorate - resolutions, passed at public meetings by Farmers and Settlers! Associations, Pastures Protection Boards, local shire councils, and other bodies. I do not think that any other item in the Tariff has evoked so much criticism as this one has done. I know of no duty that has called for more unanimous condemnation than the impost upon wire-netting.I hope that the Government will stand by their guns in regard to the motion to give priority of consideration to the item. I recognise that there are other important items in . the schedule, which the Government would be wise to bring forward as speedily as possible. In that way, they would reach a more satisfactory settlement of the Tariff, and the minor items would not be debated at such great length, but would be practically dealt with on a vote of the Committee. Let us get to the important items, so that the (Committee may not be on pins and needles, waiting for months to know when an important item will be considered, while a number of minor ones are being talked to death, or used, as a means of blocking the fair consideration of those of more importance, affecting a large section of the community. I regret that the. Government have met with so much opposition to the motion, but I trust that they will adhere to the position they have taken up, and get the more important items out of the road as speedily as possible. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Cook stated that he was at a loss to know why members who were in favour of the motion to . give priority of consideration to wire-netting did not stand up and defend it. The reason is that we have nothing to defend. I congratulate the Minister on the proposal to bring wire-netting on first. Instead of a duty being imposed on wire-netting, a bonus should be given to the farmers for using it. I notice that the only members who are opposing the motion are those representing large centres of population. </para>

                        <para>- That is . perfectly true. If this was an item affecting manufacturers in Melbourne, the whole of those honorable members would be howling for it to be placed first, but the position is different when it is a question of helping a primary industry. I interjected that so far as the primary industries were concerned, we were getting no help at all from this Government. We do not look for any, because we know that we shall not get it. The honorable member for Cook, who was armed with a mass of figures, said that the manufacturers of wire-netting in New South Wales had given the Treasurer the assurance that the price of their product would always be <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> under that of the imported article. How good the honorable member is to give that assurance ! The price of wire-netting fluctuates in the same way as does the price of any metal, and we thank him for nothing. The pastoral and agricultural industries of Australia are the backbone of the Commonwealth. They have to send their produce abroad. </para>

                <para>Mr.PAGE. - I shall allow the honorable member for Barrier to look after that. My constituency is purely pastoral and agricultural. There is a little mining, but not much. The whole of the western portions of Queensland are devoted to pastoral and agricultural pursuits. I am reminded by the Attorney-General that there is an alluvial gold mine at Clermont, silver-mines at Anakie, and opal mines in the far south-western and central western portions of Queensland. The people there,' however, are as anxious as any one else for this item to be settled quickly. The present duty on wire-netting means £810s. a mile extra to those who use the article. Rabbits are coming across into central Queensland, and will very soon be in. your electorate, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.- Chairman.</inline> No doubt you will be in favour of the duty being removed, or of the item being considered first. The bonds are full of wire-netting. A merchant told me in Brisbane last week that he did not know where to store it, that the bonds .were full, and that people would not take it out. </para>

No one could have made a more earnest speech on this question than the honorable member for Calare. The honorable member for Cook stated .that he was secretary to a Farmers and Settlers' Association. If I had anything to do with that body, I would sack him to-night, for I am satisfied, after his speech about wire-netting, that he does not represent anybody but a metropolitan constituency. This question of wire-netting means practically keeping the home over the head of many settlers, not only in my constituency, but in Victoria, and in New South Wales in particular. I ask honorable members to afford one of the primary industries a chance of surviving the shock which the Government have given to it. </para>

I look upon mining machinery, for- instance, as presenting one of the most urgent questions of the Tariff, and if the Minister is willing to add that to his list I shall be glad. I hope that he will do so, but as the honorable gentleman consented to the wish of a large number of honorable members to take the item of wire-netting out of its turn, those of us who were instrumental in inducing him to take that course ought to give him. our best support now that he has taken it.

                        <para>- Not at all. I should be as slow to question the right of Niagara to tumble over the precipice. But I feel that the item of wire-netting does stand in a most peculiar position of urgency, in reference to the terrible inroads of the rabbits, not only on the great pastoral holdings, but on the farms of Australia. The men who are working those farms do not make £20,000 a year profit, as do the manufacturers of cigarettes. They make no large profits out of the cheap labour of ios. or 12s. a week. They have the hardest possible work to maintain themselves and their families. The rabbits are the greatest enemy which they have to combat, and under the circumstances it seems to me that the representatives of the city constituencies ought to co-operate with the re.presentatives of the country districts in getting the duty upon wire-netting settled immediately. I am' sorry that one or two other items have not been added to that of wire-netting. If the Treasurer is able to do so, I hope that at a later stage he will give further prominence to some of these items. But I cannot ask him to do more than he has promised to do, and I shall certainly support him in the action which he has taken. </para>

                    LYNE (Hume- Treasurer [10.37]. - In acting as I have done today I have endeavoured to carry out what appeared to be a general wish on the part of honorable members. My own impression was that it would have been better to proceed with the consideration of the items of the Tariff in the order in which they appear in the schedule. I said so from the beginning, and I believe that less time will be sacrificed by adopting that course than will otherwise be the case. But as I promised the other night to give precedence to the consideration of the duty upon wire-netting, I have attempted to respect my promise. At the same time I cannot afford to allow the question to be debated at undue, length. It should be settled immediately, or we should proceed with the discussion of the items of the Tariff in the order in which they have been arranged. Of course I cannot agree to the amendments which have been submitted. If I did so I should have to accept every other proposition of a similar character which might be brought forward. Perhaps I acted unwisely the other evening in making the promise that I did. But if I agree to further amendments what will be the result? Every honorable member will naturally desire that the item in which he is specially interested shall be given precedence. I do not know whether any other honorable members intend to speak to the motion tonight. At any rate I do not wish to have to-morrow spoiled by the continuation of this discussion. I desire to proceed with something definite to-morrow. If honorable members wish to get on with the items of the Tariff they will assist the Government to decide whether precedence shall be given to the consideration of the duty on wire-netting.' I cannot consent to any of the amendments proposed.

                    <para>- It is not a matter for me personally to consider. I gave a certain promise, and I have endeavoured to carry it out. I do not desire to waste any more time. The discussion which has taken place only serves to show how very difficult it is to select any item in the Tariff, and to give it precedence. I know perfectly well the way in which the Tariff is viewed from the hundreds of petitions which have passed through my hands. I shall not attempt to discuss -the matter upon its merits at the present stage. I cannot accept the amendments submitted, and I will ask their authors to withdraw them, and to allow us to proceed with business. </para>

                    <para>, - The Treasurer has stated that he cannot accept the amendments moved by the honorable member for Dalley and myself. I am very sorry that he cannot do so. I recognise that the honorable gentleman is taking up this position because the Opposition are going to support him. I hope they will support him throughout the Tariff, and throughout his administration. The support he will get from the Opposition to-night will be given because it suits their book. When we consider who the members of the Opposition are, and the interests they are- generally found supporting, the Treasurer, who is supposed to lead a liberal Administration does not appear very happily placed. For my part, the honorable gentleman must choose between the support of the Opposition and my support and that of honorable members who think with me. I make that statement flatly, and without any qualification or reservation of any kind. The Treasurer tells us that he is very sorry' but that he must keep the promise he has made. Of course the honorable gentleman is very sorry, but he is not half so sorry as he will be if he is not very careful. The right honorable member for East Sydney says that he is very glad to see the Treasurer in this position. Of course he is. I remember that when the honorable member for South Sydney, on one important occasion, when he was Prime Minister, said, that he could not accept a certain proposal, the right honorable member for East Sydney said that was a manly and straightforward course, and he admired the honorable member for it. But why did he admire the honorable member for 'South Sydney on that occasion? It was because he had got him in a. cleft stick, and down he went. He is taking up the same position now with regard to the Treasurer. </para>

                        <para>- Undoubtedly ; but what support can the Treasurer expect from the Opposition ? The position I occupy, so far as the Tariff is concerned, is an entirely free one. I am absolutely free to do as I please in connexion with it. I am not bound, as is the leader of the Opposition and those behind him, to support a free-trade or any other Tariff. I can allow myself the luxury of doing as I please. That is a luxury which no honorable member on the other side, who heels the ticket, can ever permit himself to enjoy with safety. </para>

                        <para>- The Treasurer had no call to make this promise carry any further than was originally intended. It was intended to give an opportunity for a discussion on the advisableness of giving preferential consideration' to the wire-netting item. That opportunity has been given, and it cannot be said that business has thereby been expedited. For my part, I say, emphatically, that the majority of the people of the country are not as much concerned about the item of wire-netting as about many others. It is clearly my duty to oppose the proposal, and I intend to do so.- If the Treasurer has a majority at his command, let him do what he pleases, but I suggest that he owes it to honorable members to adjourn at the usual hour. If he proposes to make a trial of strength, I have no doubt that in the end hie will win. If he permits the adjournment at a reasonable time, and is of the same opinion to-morrow, and intends to force this proposal through, I shall do no more than press my amendment to a division, and leave it at that. </para>

                    <para>.- We are witnessing an extraordinary enthusiasm to proceed with the country's business on the part of honorable members who, at this time on Tuesday evenings, usually plead for an adjournment, on the ground that they have made a long train journey. In view of the position reached in connexion with this matter to-night, the Treasurer would be well advised to give honorable members an opportunity to think out some solution of the difficulty. After the speech delivered by the honorable gentleman, we must resist his proposal. ' He has stated that, whatever may be the fate of this particular proposal to take the item of wire-netting out of its turn, he will resist a similar proposal in connexion with any other item. I hope that if a division is to be taken in this matter an opportunity will be given honorable members to bring forward items which they believe to be of more importance than the item of wire-netting, and that the precedence to be afforded to their consideration may be tested without undue debate. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know that honorable members opposite are not willing to help in the matter, but the Treasurer seems disposed to agree to the consideration of the item of wire-netting out of its turn, and to absolutely taboo any proposal for precedence for any other item. That, in my opinion, is a wrong decision. If the Treasurer will not allow us an opportunity to consider this matter between now and to-morrow's sitting, the decision arrived at will probably cause endless trouble in connexion with the consideration of other items. </para>

                        <para>- So far as I am concerned, the discussion has been serious, and I shall prove that by fighting with all my strength for my proposals. It is a mere mockery for honorable members to say that preference should be given to the wire-netting item, and to items affecting the food supplies of the community, and then allow the wire-netting- item alone to be dealt with out of its order. The Treasurer had no right to propose an alteration of the order of procedure. If items . are to be dealt with out of their order, honorable members will never be safe in leaving the Chamber, because they will never know when matters in which they are particularly interested will be considered. The Treasurer said last week that he would not allow public business to be taken out of his hands, but to-night he is practically allowing that. He does not believe in his own motion. He said that he regarded the applications for preference to the wire-netting item as hysterical, and that if there were to be a long discussion on the motion it should not be gone on with. That was a clear invitation to honorable members to show a strong case against the proposal. I have put forward a strong case for the early consideration of the duties on food supplies, and I look to every member of the Labour Party to support me. ' </para>

                        <para>- There is too much silent agreement. It is marvellous that there should be agreement in regard to the wire-netting item and not in regard to other important items. Is it because the other duties affect the poor, and they have no friends at court? </para>

                        <para>- I cannot understand honorable members supporting the proposal to give early consideration to the wire-netting item, and not supporting the proposal to give early consideration to other items. I appeal to free-traders to support my proposals. Apparently the Treasurer is inviting the Committee to reduce the duty on wire-netting, because, if it is not to be reduced, nothing is to be gained by dealing with it in advance. If a Victorian industry were at stake, the Victorian protectionists would be the last to allow an item affecting it to be taken out of its order, and would be ready to stop 'up all night to prevent it. I take my stand in this matter as an independent. I trust that the Treasurer will consent to report progress, but if he does not, he can look forward to discussion on all the proposals which are before the Committee. </para>

                        <para>- It is the simplest way out of the difficulty. It is evident, from the interjections of the honorable member for Parkes, that it is intended that there shall be an interminable discussion on every item in the Tariff. If that is attempted, I shall be prepared to vote for the application of the gag. I do not regard to-night's discussion as  unprofitable. It has shown that some honorable members as sincerely desire other items to have precedence as others desire that the wire-netting item shall be dealt with first, and they have just as great a claim to consideration. If my suggestion be not adopted, we must face the prospect indicated by the intimation of honorable members that they will use every means they can to block the Tariff. </para>

                    <para>.- With all due respect to the opinion of a number of honorable members, I think that this is a complicated question. The Treasurer submitted a motion to postpone all items up to item 187; the . honorable member for West Sydney moved to exempt certain items from the operation of the postponement, and the honorable member for Dalley then moved an amendment to exempt further items. I think that the intention of the honorable members when submitting their proposals was to test the general question as to whether items were to be- considered out of their turn, and then to make an application to have them considered subsequently. I suggest, as a suitable means of testing the question, that the movers of amendments temporarily withdraw their amendments, and that, instead of selecting item 187, a test division be taken on item 28. The result of the division might be taken as an indication whether or not we should proceed ' with item 187, , and my proposal would not have the damaging effect of excluding every other item, in the event of the amendments, of the honorable member for Dalley . and the honorable -member for West Sydney being rejected. </para>

                    <para>. - It is not my intention to insist on all the items I have mentioned as being of sufficient importance for urgent treatment, but to protest against the taking of wire-netting by itself. Of course, if the Committee decide to give precedence to nothing but wire-netting we can do no more. I took exception to the statement of the Treasurer that the Committee could not agree on a selection of items, and said there was no way of finding that out until we had something definite before the Committee. I am quite willing to take an earlier item selected by the honorable member for Dalley as a test item. At present I do not see that it is necessary to withdraw my amendment, because the item referred to by the honorable member for Dalley is ahead of mine. I suggest that a division be taken on the item suggested by the honorable member for Dalley, when there will be no necessity to divide on the question relating to item 187. But if we are to be kept here until we decide, in regard to item 187, I shall feel morally bound to support the honorable member for Dalley, and he, of course, will support me, and we shall be here all night. All-night sittings do not appeal to me, but I know that if we reach a certain stage, we -shall remain here. </para>

The items I have selected are sago, tapioca, candles, currants, rice, apparel, and woollens, and I select these in order that the Committee may have an opportunity of saying that if there is to be any precedence it shall not be confined to wire netting, but shall extend to the necessaries of life. The honorable member for Kalgoorlie has made a wise suggestion, but I do not see why he has selected item 28. </para>

The necessaries of life are quite as important as the industry of wire-netting. If the Committee add sago and tapioca to the items to which precedence shall be given, I understand the result will be to give precedence to wire-netting and five or six other items. But even if the Committee do not fall in with my proposal, the difficulty will not be got over, because as soon as wire-netting has been dealt with I shall move that precedence be given to items embracing the necessaries of life.

                        <para>- That would be to re-open the debate, after we had closed it by deciding to take item 187. We are proposing to make a further selection. It seems to me that' that will lead to a difficulty. Anxious as I have been to see some other items put in the preferential cate-. gory, I am bound to say that we shall land' ourselves in difficulties, and I shall, therefore, be compelled to confine my vote for the present to special treatment being given to wire-netting. </para>

                    <para>. - I understand that honorable members are agreed that a vote with reference to giving special treatment to the item tapioca is not to be considered as an expression of opinion on the item itself. It will merely be a test concerning the desire of some honorable members to give special consideration to other items than wire-netting. Of course, any honorable member has a right to move that special consideration be given to any item. That right cannot be taken away. I hope that we shall now come to a division, the result of which will show, the extent to which honorable members desire to take items out of their regular order. </para>

                        <para>.- The honorable member for Parramatta last week expressed the opinion that there was some little inconsistency on my part in saying that during the general elections campaign I was not questioned about my attitude towards Tariff reform,' and did not promise at any meeting to occupy a position on either side of the fiscal fence, while at the same time admitting that later on I sent out circulars to the manufacturers -in my  electorate seeking information under a' number of headings to enable me to carry out my Tariff pledges. As a matter of fact, I stated in my manifesto that I would weigh the evidence for and against every item coming before Parliament, ana vote in accordance with what I believed to be the best interests of the country. I sent out the circular in order that I might be in a position to give' effect to the . promise I had made to deal fairly with all interests affected by the fiscal question. The honorable member for Parramatta has strained the matter a good deal to make some inconsistency out of what I said, but if he will look at my speech, he will see that I was quite consistent. I did not pledge myself at the elections on either side of the fiscal fence. What I said was that I would try to deal fairly with every item: </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Corangamite need not have interrupted me. I had about finished what I intended to say. I wanted information in order to be able to deal fairly with the different interests presented, particularly in connexion with my own electorate. I think I did quite right in trying to get the fullest information upon every industry in my electorate, so that when I had to give a vote here, I should not be voting in the dark. If the honorable member for Parramatta imagines that he can find any inconsistency in the two statements which T have made, I do not think he wilt succeed, if he bears what I have said in mind. </para>
