I suppose the object is to prevent the importation of acetic acid vinegar, and while I have no objection to the duty proposed for that purpose I suggest that it might be well later on to consider the advisableness of imposing an Excise duty on vinegar made from acetic acid to check its manufacture here. </para>

                            <para>.The duty on anhydrous ammonia is equivalent to about11/2d. per lb. Anhydrous ammonia, which is used for refrigerating purposes, was at one time sold at 2s. and 2s. 6d. per lb., but we have now established here two large manufactories, and the price has been reduced to1s. per lb. The duty proposed is a comparatively small one. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member is quite right. The product is made entirely from Australian articles, such as the by-products of the gas companies. The industry is also a big consumer of coal ; and the article is made largely from Australian lime. This is a native Australian industry and we are making the product much purer than any which is imported. </para>

                                <para>- 15 per cent. is only a revenue duty. Is the Minister going to be content with that in the case of this important and growing industry ? My own opinion is that the proposed duty should not be agreed to. The article is manufactured from by-products, and there is abundant evidence that we can make it as cheaply as can anybody else in the world. At any rate, we ought to be able to do so. The item should either be placed on the free list or subjected to a small duty, say of  5  or  10  per cent. If there is to be a protective duty,  15  per cent. is too low. If there is to be a revenue duty, the proposal is too high. </para>

I am glad that the Government are prepared to impose a duty on these products. Fifteen per cent. will satisfy the manufacturers and give them the amount of protection necessary to enable them to enter into competition with the importations. </para>

Is the new protection to apply to these manufacturers? We are told that the industry is flourishing, that the works are multiplying throughout Australia, and producing an exceedingly good article, which is much superior, according to the honorable member for Fawkner, to the imported. The manufacturers are able to compete with the imported article, and even to invade foreign markets. Even protectionists believe that when there is a considerable export business, import duties are no longer effective. Here we have a case in which, apparently, the Australian product can compete successfully with the product of the world, and yet manufacturers ask for a duty, which, of course, cannot be protective. </para>

                            <para>.- This item ought to be made absolutely free. When the first Commonwealth Tariff was submitted, the proposal was to impose a duty of  20  per cent., but, after discussion, it was decided to make the item free. The official statistics show what the proposed preference to the United Kingdom is worth. The total imports from the United Kingdom last year were represented by  £1,469,  while the imports from foreign countries were represented by  . £63,132.  Carbide of calcium is used for the manufacture of acetylene gas, which is the illuminant of many country people; and the duty simply means additional taxation to the extent of  £6,300  per annum. I think I need say no more in favour of the suggestion that the item should be absolutely free. </para>

                            <para>.- The duty of  10  per cent. is imposed in consequence of representations made from persons in Queensland, who have entered into some arrangement with the State Government for the supply of motive power . from Barron Falls. These people propose to manufacture carbide of calcium, and, as I say, it is in consequence of their representations that the duty is proposed. </para>

However, I place no value on the information - I take it for just what it is worth. Carbide of calcium ought to be placed on the same footing as kerosene, because it is used as an illuminant mainly by country people. </para>

                                <para>- I should like to see  20  per cent. imposed under the General Tariff, and these articles admitted free from the United Kingdom. Take, for example quill ay a bark. It is not grown in the Commonwealth. It is used principally for promoting the growth of hair. It may be used in the raw state by simply soaking it in. warm water. When rubbed upon the bald pate, it has a tendency to make the hair grow. A considerable quantity of' it is imported from America. Then salicylate of soda is a drug which is used in the treatment of rheumatic fever. Why should persons who are suffering from illness be taxed upon the drugs that they require to use? </para>

                            <para>We, the undersigned aerated water makers and brewers of non-intoxicant ales, desire to respectfully and urgently bring before the notice of you and your Government the hardships entailed on us by the prohibition of the importation of saccharin into the Commonwealth (for other than medicinal purposes). The endorsements of the medical profession show the properties of saccharin to be innocuous to man, only the mere fact of its having no food value can be advanced against its use. We do not pretend to sell our goods for their food value, though the sweetening properties of our aerated waters contain two-thirds sugar. Saccharin has been of inestimable value to us in lessening the risks of fermentation in aerated waters, and in keeping the spirit in non-intoxicating beers down to the 2 per cent. limit allowed by the Excise. To prohibit its importation means the total extinction of the non-alcoholic ale industry, it being impossible to keep within the limits of the Excise by the use of sugar only. </para>

                        <para class="block">As a matter of fact it is claimed by all the manufacturers that they cannot produce tonic ales with less than  2  per cent. of alcohol if they have to use sugar only. What they do is to use two-thirds of sugar and one-third of saccharin, and the result is that they can keep the intoxicant percentage down to that which is prescribed by the Excise law. In a report, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. P.</inline> Wilkinson, the Victorian Government analyst, had made this statement - </para>

                            <para>Stringent prohibitions of the use of any saccharin in any food or beverage under extremely heavy penalties are now in force in Great Britain. </para>
                            <para>In respect of that statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilkinson,</inline> the petitioners say - </para>
                            <para>This is absolutely incorrect. Saccharin is prohibited in Great Britain in beer for revenue purposes, but is used freely, and to an" enormous extent, in other beverages, mineral waters' especially, and no case of any, trouble through its use has been recorded here. It is quite harmless. </para>
                            <para class="block">In proof of their contention, the petitioners cite an expert opinion by Thomas Stevenson, M.D., F.R.C.P., London, lecturer on forensic medicine and chemistry at Guy's Hospital, and Official Analyst to the Home Office. He says- </para>
                            <para class="block">Saccharin is quite innocuous when taken , in quantities largely exceeding what would be taken in any ordinary dietary.,. T.t. does not interfere wilh or impede the digestive processes when taken in any practicable quantity. Our personal experience fs that saccharin may be taken for an extended period without interfering with the digestive or other  bodily  functions ; hence there is no reason to think that its continued use is in any way harmful. </para>
                            <para class="block">The <inline font-style="italic">Medical Press</inline> of the 31st October, 1888, states that " saccharin is perfectly wholesome"; while <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. T.</inline> Lauder Brunton declares that " saccharin has no injurious action in man." I have a list containing the names of scores of medical men of high repute "who all claim that the use of saccharin is not injurious. I may mention that in the case of certain diseases it is prescribed because it is better than sugar for sweetening purposes. My object is to elicit the reason why the Government have taken this extreme step, because so far as I can see it is not warranted by any statement in the .evidence given before the Tariff Commission. </para>

                        <para>The limitations made by this item are identical with those framed and gazetted on the nth December, 1906. The object is to  place  limitations on the use of saccharin, which is not viewed with favour by the medical faculty. The use of saccharin in the preparation of foods, cordials, &amp;c, is prohibited in some States. The importation of saccharin is forbidden except for medical purposes. The Tariff Commission is very strong against its use, and the duty is their recommendation. Its use is said to  be very  deleterious in many cases, and the local Acts of some of the States forbid its use. The health authorities are against it, and the duty is no doubt prohibitive. </para>

                                <para>- I have this feeling about the matter - that it might reasonably be left to be dealt with by the States. If in some States the use of saccharin has been prohibited under local Acts, I do not see why we should waste time in discussing it, or take the responsibility for the exclusion of saccharin upon our shoulders. Attention will be drawn to the subject by the debate which we have had to-day, and the reasons for the proposed duty will be made known. Personally, I do not feel disposed to occupy much time about it, and if there is any serious objection to the proposed duty I will strike it out, leaving the States to deal with the matter. That seems to be the fairest thing to do. The information that the proposed duty would be prohibitive comes from the head of the Department. </para>

                                <para>- It is not a food, but certain manufacturers have found it desirable to use it in very small quantities in order to prevent the fermentation which often takes place if sugar is used, and which imparts alcohol to beverages. In some States the importation of saccharin has been interfered with really on the ground that its consumption reduces the quantity of sugar used; though that cannot be the case to any considerable extent. If its use is deleterious, we should be still admitting it for human consumption under the proposal of the Government. A duty of  30s.  per lb., while it excludes . saccharin for manufacturing purposes - for use in aerated waters, for instance - would not exclude it for consumption medicinally. </para>

                                <para>- The Minister would allow saccharin to be imported for human use in the way in which possibly it 'is most largely consumed. A man who takes saccharin with every cup of tea he drinks consumes infinitely more than he would do by drinking occasionally aerated waters. So that taken in the form in which its consumption would be largest and most deleterious it is proposed to admit it ; because the duty of  30s.  per lb. would not exclude saccharin for use . in that form. The position is absolutely illogical. The aerated water manufacturers would be prohibited from using it on account of its price, but people could still consume it as a substitute for sugar under doctors' orders. </para>

                            <para>. - I am glad that the Minister has promised to allow the duty on saccharin to be struck out. The States can do whatever may be necessary. It seems to be fairly well established that saccharin is innocuous, but if it is not the States can pass the necessary legislation to prohibit its use. In any case, if we  prohibited its importation we could not stop the English firm which manufactures and exports it from establishing a branch for its manufacture here. So that we might still have it used ir» mineral waters even if we prohibited its importation. I draw attention to a case which occurred in England in which it seems to have been shown that where the strength of saccharin was lower than  330  above the strength of sugar, it was not saccharin within the meaning of the Finance Act  1 90 1.  I draw attention to this decision in view of the possibility of the importation of saccharin being regulated by the Customs Department. As the matter stands now, saccharin seems to be a constituent which- is  550  above the strength of sugar. In England it has been de-  tided that saccharin is not saccharin unless it is over  330  and anything up to  550.  It has been held that a substance possessing a- sweetness of  329  is not saccharin. Therefore it is possible that, if paragraph b is not struck out, an inferior class of saccharin will be imported, notwithstanding our attempt to prohibit its importation. The matter was gone into thoroughly in the case of <inline font-style="italic">McNicol</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Pinch,</inline> 2 <inline font-style="italic">Q. B.

                            <para>.- Although the statement has been made that it is desirable to impose a duty on saccharin to protect the sugar industry, I do not support it on that ground. But there is no warrant for maintaining that saccharin is a food. Unless it is diluted before being taken, it is a very unwholesome product, in fact, dangerous if consumed in its raw state. But if saccharin were allowed to be imported freely, it would be used by unscrupulous manufacturers, not only in the making of aerated water, but also in the making of sweetmeats, to the injury of the health of the youth of Australia. </para>

                                <para>- That is true. I would point out that we must have an import duty on saccharin, since it is proposed to have an Excise duty of £5 per ton upon it. I object to paragraph  b  being struck out, although I should not object to the  omission of the words " when imported for medicinal purposes only." We must have an import duty on saccharin to regulate its importation, and also an Excise duty, otherwise we should have a wholesale production and consumption of this objectionable article, without any State regulation. </para>

                            <para>. - I disagree with the honorable member for Bendigo. There is no necessity to impose a duty on saccharin if it does not serve a useful purpose. Departmental by-laws can be made to meet the conditions. If we wish to prevent the wholesale manufacture of saccharin in Australia, we can impose an Excise without an import duty. </para>

                            <para>.- On consideration, I think that it would be well to adopt the method suggested by the honorable member for Grey. In England the local manufacture of saccharin is regulated under the Finance Act of 1901.Its regulation here must necessarily be in the hands of the Commonwealth authorities because otherwise one State might prohibit the use of saccharin in the manufacture of aerated waters, whilst another might have no such prohibition, and we should thus have a most invidious distinction between State and! State. Let us retain the duty, strike out the words " except when imported for medicinal purposes only," and then under the Excise provisions we shall be able to regulate the production of saccharin just as it is done in England. </para>

What I suggest is that cresylic acid, crude creosote oil, tar oil, and carbolic acid should be free; that phenyles, liquid disinfectants, liquid sheep-washes, insecticides, sheep-branding preparations, and saponaceous mixture of creosote should bear a duty of2s. per gallon; and that a new item, consisting of powder or paste sheep-dips and carbolic powder preparations, be made dutiable at 10s. per 100 lbs. </para>

                                <para>- Under the old Tariff this item was free, and the Treasurer must know that more sheep dip is used in Australia than, perhaps, in any other part of the world. In South Australia it is compulsory to clip sheep once a year, or, perhaps, twice a year, according to the discretion of the inspector. I am sure that the Treasurer, who is familiar with all matters connected with stock, would not do anything to injure or hamper those more particularly interested. </para>

                        <para class="block">Sheep dip is imported in a concentrated form, and water has to be added after its arrival ; but the importer is so anxious about the welfare of the community that a certain percentage of water is added before its arrival. Honorable members should be made aware that, not only in Victoria, but in other States, there is being manufactured sheep dip which will compare most favorably with the imported article. Honorable members may ask why the local producers do not obtain the whole of the trade. The reason is simply because, like other Australian manufacturers, they have to compete not only against enormous capital, but also against enormous prejudice. As a matter of fact, it  is prejudice which prevents the local manufacturers obtaining the market. Only a little while ago, £10,000 worth of sheep dip was landed here at something like one-third below ordinary cost. </para>

                                <para>- I am giving a specific case. The importer, by reason of his greater capital, is able to employ large numbers of advertising agents; and it is in this connexion that the local manufacturer is seriously crippled. The latter has not the capital at his command necessary to send agents throughout the length and breadth of the country; and we all know that orders are generally secured by travellers who personally call on the squatters and farmers. </para>

                                <para>- The local manufacturer cannot afford to pay anything like the commission that is allowed by the importer. Travellers are either paid salary and commission, or commission only ; and the person who is able to send out large numbers of travellers is able to compete successfully against the man who has to depend on ordinary newspaper advertising. This industry has already been established in Australia; and, as pointed out by the honorable member for Yarra, those engaged in it have to pay duty on the bottles and tins they use. </para>

It is true that the duty has been taken off a portion of the raw material of this industry to the extent of 6d. per gallon ; but that is a small matter when we consider what is necessary in the manufacture of disinfectants. </para>

                                <para>- Of course the honorable member is surprised, though he ought not to be, when we recollect that the local production is equal, if not superior, to the imported article. It is only because of prejudice on the part of people like the honorable member that the local manufacturers are unable to secure the market to which they are entitled. I hope the Committee will agree to a reasonable duty. </para>

                            <para>. - From the arguments which have been advanced, it appears that Australian phenyle, as a sheep wash, is far superior to the imported article. It seems to me, therefore, that the industry is one which does not require protection. If it were otherwise, the representatives of the firms which have embarked upon it would have  given evidence before the Tariff Commission. To levy a duty upon insecticides, sheep washes, and disinfectants, in a country like Australia, where there are so many insect pests, is altogether out of the question. Further, any Customs impost would not induce stock owners to purchase a particular sheep wash in preference to others on account of its slightly decreased cost. Their great object is to obtain the very best sheep wash that is procurable, altogether regardless of its price. Consequently sheep washes should be admitted free. If imported sheep washes are superior to the Australian article they will command the trade, and <inline font-style="italic">vice versa.</inline> I hope that the Treasurer will stand firm upon this item. </para>

As a matter of fact they are being made in Australia, and I have the assurance of Messrs. Faulding and Company that the disinfectants which they manufacture will accomplish all that is claimed for them. </para>

I hope that the Treasurer will not be influenced by his representations. I trust that he will strictly adhere to the Government proposal. To stock owners it is a matter of the utmost importance that sheep washes should be admitted free. Instead of endeavouring to increase their price to the consumer we ought to do everything in our power to lessen it. I hope that the Treasurer will not allow even one of his supporters to influence him in this matter. </para>

It is identical in every respect with the dip which is imported by, this company. Yet the price charged to the user for the imported article in 5-gaUon. drums is 6s. per gallon, whilst the price of the Australian wash to the consumer  is only 4s. per gallon. </para>

                                <para>- I have spoken of only two firms, neither of which are very large. They are merely struggling concerns. The 40-gallon casks containing this sheep wash from abroad are sold to the user at 5s. 6d. per gallon, whilst the Australian article is supplied to him at 3s.9d. per gallon. It will be seen, therefore, that the statement of the honorable member tor Oxley is an utterly fallacious one. Further, I hold in my hand an undertaking from the manufacturer of this particular sheep wash, that if a duty be imposed upon the imported article, he will not increase the price of the Australian article to the consumer. </para>

                            <para>.- It is a shame that the Treasurer should listen for a moment to a suggestion to levy a duty upon this item. The articles specified in it were admitted free under the old Tariff and the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission have also recommended that they should be placed upon the list of special exemptions. Strangely enough, the free-trade section of that body recommended that they should be dutiable at 5 per cent. These facts furnish convincing evidence that the question is one which should be considered from two points of view. Various reasons have been advanced in favour of the imposition of a duty. The honorable member for Laanecoorie has brought forward the stale argument that by adopting that course the price of the articles would not be increased. Yet we hear complaints every day that the imposition of duties under this Tariff has led to an increase in the price of goods. That circumstance, I think, effectually disposes of the honorable member's contention. . Unfortunately, we have persons coming to the precincts of the Chamber and button-holing various honorable members. From what I have noticed this morning, and also this afternoon, I suspect that the honorable member for Kooyong is in favour of. increasing this duty. ' I do not see any reason why I should not mention an incident of that sort. It is not right that this button-holing should take place. Only the other day, a man sued in a Court for the payment of a certain sum because he had influenced the votes of honorable members on items in the last Tariff. </para>

                                <para>- I propose to read a letter which I have received from a gentleman who is interested in the question of sheep dips and disinfectants, and who represents Arnold's Balsam Co. If this industry is fairly established in Australia  - and I think we have good ground to believe that it is - there is no reason why a protective duty should be imposed. The  Chairman  of theA section of the Tariff Commission quoted the evidence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> Dearman. I notice that the witness stated that this article was not produced in quite such a large way. as it might be, and the reason which he gave for that state of things was not the want of a duty, but simply the fact that people would not buy the local article. He asserted that not only was there a prejudice against the local article, but that it existed to such an extent that the local article was sold under an English name, so that the imposition of a duty has very little to do with the matter. My correspondent, who represents Arnold's Balsam Co., says - </para>

                            <para>We are importers of " phenyle," mentioned in the .Tariff as a saponaceous compound of cresylic acid, carbolic acid, tar, &amp;c. The duty proposed is 6d. per gallon. For years this has been made in the different States from coal tar, to be had in large quantities from the gas-works. The formula is simple, very little labour required. lt is sold in Melbourne by Chas. Atkins and Co., 472 Flinders-street, at is. 4½d. per gallon, and Morris and Ladwig, Prahran, at the same price. The cos't to make will work out at under is. per gallon. In our opinion there is no necessity for a duh ; the freight is sufficient protection. </para>

He states that, in his opinion, there is no necessity for a duty, and that the freight is quite sufficient protection to the local manufacturers. When an item of this kind is brought under consideration, It is only right that the Committee should hear both sides of the question. The letter I have read represents one side of this question, and if honorable members wish it, I am prepared .to quote from several letters which I have received, and which will support an argument to the contrary effect. I have received a letter from McKellan &amp; Ramsay, chemical manufacturers. of 62 and 64 Bouverie-street, Carlton, with a town office at 317 Little Collins-street, Melbourne.

Under the present Tariff, coal-tar oil and carbolic acid, both formerly free, are now dutiable at 6d. per gallon, whereas disinfectants and sheep dips are admitted free. </para>
                        <para>Coal-tar oil and carbolic acid form the raw materials in our manufactures, and thus we have the absurd anomaly - raw material, duty 6d. per gallon, manufactured article admitted free. </para>

We do an extensive business in the manufacture of sheep dips and phenyle, and our manufactures are identical in composition with the above brands. </para>
                        <para>In importing tar oil and carbolic acid we have to pay 6d. per gallon duty. We then mix with soda and resin as above explained and manufacture into sheep dip and phenyle. </para>

                        <para class="block">I have several other letters in my possession, but no doubt most honorable members have received a copy of each letter, and studied its contents at their leisure. This is another instance in' which, for the sake of bolstering up a few miserable manufacturers within the limits of the cities, our great primary industries are to be taxed. We know very well that these disinfectants and sheep dips are what might almost be called the raw material of the wool-growers. For that reason alone they should be able to purchase them as cheaply as possible. The honorable member for Laanecoorie has attempted to argue that if we place a heavy duty on the articles, they will become cheaper, but I think I have shown' conclusively that his argument was entirely without any weight. I am opposed to the imposition of a duty. The Minister, in his wisdom, has proposed that the article should be free. The  Chairman  of the Tariff Commission made no comment on the matter: very little evidence was placed before him. Every one knows that the Treasurer is the last man to show want of backbone. If any one can sit tight and fast he can do so. I trust that on this item he will sit tight and fast as he has done on other occasions, and will refuse to have his schedule altered. </para>

                            <para>. - I wish to protest against the sweeping generalities in which the honorable member for Hunter has indulged. He has spoken about this being a petty and miserable manufacturing industry confined to the limits of a. few cities. The manufacture of disinfectants and sheep dips is so easy that they are made in many country towns in New South Wales. Apart from several manufactories in Sydney, there is a company operating in Bathurst. The question of the duty on creosote and tar oils was involved in the question of the duty on sheep dips, but now that these oils have been made free, it is only consistent on the part of the Government to impose an effective protective duty on disinfectants and sheep dips, particularly on the latter. The honorable member for Hunter mentioned the constituent parts of certain sheep dips without making any deduction from them. The deduction is that the constituent parts of the local article go to show that it is much stronger and much more efficacious than the imported article, and it is sold at a cheaper price. The imposition of a duty could not possibly have the effect of raising the price because, as I mentioned, almost any one can make the article. The manufacturers give the whole formula without any reservation so that any one can obtain the material parts and mix the dip for themselves. If anything calls for a duty I maintain that this article does. The imported article is decidedly inferior to that which is locally made. </para>

                            <para>- The recommendation of the Tariff Commission with regard to this item was that it should be free. It was free under the old Tariff and it is free under the Tariff proposed by the Government. I am one of those who believe that as protection is the policy of the country we should give a reasonable amount of protection on a commodity which can be manufactured in Australia. But this is a commodity which affects the largest producing interest in the Commonwealth. </para>

                                <para>-I have not said anything of the sort. As it can be made in. Australia, the makers are entitled to a measure of protection. But in view of the great importance of the industry, affecting not only large sheep stations but small farmers and the bulk of the people generally - it is one which we cannot afford to trifle with. I should not have risen except for the statement of the honorable member for Laanecoorie to the effect that certain manufacturers of this commodity in Australia were prepared to give a guarantee that the price would not be increased to the consumer. I view guarantees of that sort with a great deal of suspicion. We must take every precaution to see that the cost of these commodities is not increased. </para>

                        <para>Mr.PALMER.- I hold in my hand a statement - a copy of which has been sent to every honorable member - which shows the value of guarantees that prices will not be increased. As a matter of fact, the stern logic of events proves that in regard to almost every item in the Tariff, where an increased duty has been imposed, an increased price to the consumer has- followed. Numerous invoices have been produced in this Chamber to prove that statement. The honorable member for Laanecoorie assures us that some person who is. making these sheep dips is prepared to give a guarantee. I reply that the value of such guarantees is shown by a document that has been forwarded to honorable members by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDougall,</inline> of the firm of Sands and McDougall.  His  letter contains the following paragraph - </para>
                        <para>In giving my evidence before the Tariff Commission, I said that if the duty on strawboard was increased by £1 per ton, the Australian Paper Mills Co. Pty., Limited, would not increase their price for strawboard ; but as the House of Representatives has not yet dealt with that item, we have a perfect right to increase our price until such time as the duty is determined upon. </para>
                        <para class="block">In view of that statement, coming from one who gave a guarantee that the price of an article would not be increased as the result 'of a duty, what value can be attached to such a statement as has been made by the honorable member for Laanecoorie? Although my vote may be at variance with what may be supposed to be protectionist policy, I am determined to cast it in such a direction that the larger interests of  this community shall not be sacrificed for the benefit of the smaller ones. </para>

But what does he regard as a high duty? Yesterday he was clamouring for duties up to 200 per cent, and 300 per cent, to be retained. What would the honorable member regard as a high duty? </para>

                                <para>- That is about as reasonable an answer as could be expected from the honorable member. But unreasonable as he proves himself to be, he is able to dictate a policy to the Department of Trade and Customs. He is able to dictate a protectionist policy for Australia. I congratulate him. I congratulate the Minister on his susceptibility. Hitherto, it appears', the ignorance of the Department and the ignorance of the Minister were in need of enlightenment. </para>

                                <para>- I despair of asking him for an explanation about anything. We had evidence the other day of the stores of knowledge that are wrapped up in his cranium. I ' do not wish to go to that source of information. It is about time that the Treasurer either pleaded total ignorance in regard to most of the matters connected with the Tariff and acknowledged that he is prepared to accept the direction of the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, whom he might very well attach to his Department, or investigated matters for himself. He told us that he knew all about sheep, having had to do with them all his life, and was therefore quite aware how his proposal would affect the pastoral industry. If he considered that the local manufacture of sheep dips should be protected, why did he not provide for its protection when framing the Tariff, or move in that direction when the last Tariff was under consideration. One begins to understand the criticism' of the Minister of Defence, that the Treasurer seems to know nothing, about protection except when he is out of office. Now that he is in office, he has to take, his policy from the honorable member for Melbourne Ports. The proposed duty is outrageously high. I am told that sheep dips are sold here at 4s. a gallon. </para>

                            <para>.- The honorable member for Parramatta has found fault with the honorable member for Melbourne Ports for suggesting the imposition of n. duty on sheep dip. Let me refresh the memory of the Committee as to what occurred when this item was under discussion in connexion with the consideration of the old Tariff. The Treasurer was a Minister in the Protectionist Government which introduced that Tariff, the Government being supported by strong protectionists such as the then, honorable member for New England, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sawers,</inline> and the then honorable member for Gwydir, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cruickshank.</inline> But when the item sheep dip was under consideration, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sawers,</inline> who was a pastoralist, strongly supported a motion that it be placed on the free list, and that proposition was also supported by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cruickshank</inline> and carried. Apparently "the sheep in the large .pastoral properties owned by the honorable member for Melbourne Port's on the shores of Hobson's Bay do not need dipping, and therefore he is ready to impose a tax on sheep dip. The Minister on the last occasion had nothing to say against sheep dip being admitted duty free. He then knew as much about' the pastoral industry as he knows now, and as much about the manufacture pf sheep dip, and yet he did not suggest that it be made dutiable. The proposed duty of 2:s. per gallon is largely duty on water. As the honorable member for Barker has pointed out, disinfectants are used in connexion with other live stock besides sheep. The proposed tax would be a very heavy one on primary producers, and therefore I hope that it will not be agreed to, and that sheep dip will be placed on the free list. </para>

                            <para>-25l- - The Treasurer should stick to his original proposal, and not spring an amendment of this sort on the Committee at a moment's notice. The honorable member for Melbourne Ports is always ready to build up city businesses at the expense of country industries. Every farmer has to use disinfectants of one kind and another in connexion with live stock, and a 'medical man like the honorable member for Laanecoorie should be one of the' first to encourage their use, because the greater the precautions against disease, the greater the health of the community, and of the stock, and the larger the production of the country. </para>

                                <para>- One of the witnesses before the Tariff Commission guaranteed that if the duty which he suggested were agreed to, he would not raise his price. But when he found that some of his requirements had been made dutiable, he paid no regard to that statement, and increased his charges. I was also told that shortly after the Tariff was introduced, the price of a certain kind of bottle was to be increased by 2s. 6d. per gross. Those who are making sheep dips in Australia have been engaged in the business long enough to be able to do without this protection. If their dips are valuable, the pastoral and farming community will buy them, because those engaged in rearing sheep know what best suits their business. They would not use imported dips if they thought Australian dips were better. The proposed duty is equal to 50 per cent, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> on the cheaper imported dips, though it is not so high on concentrated dips, such as Cooper's, which cost ros. per gallon. The proposed duty will be a tax on primary production, and against the interests of the public health. The honorable member for Laanecoorie ought to encourage the use of disinfectants. </para>

In' my opinion, the wine-making industry does not need protection of that kind. I hope that the Treasurer will reconsider his proposal. </para>

                                <para>- The imports in 1905 were valued at .£51,000, and in 1904 at  £4 I,000.  There has been a strong expression of opinion in favour of a duty on sheep dips, and I have been asked to submit this proposal to the Committee since it is not competent for a private member to do so. It is a disgrace to Australia that even a gallon of these dips should be imported, and- the big men who introduce it are not in sympathy with Australian sentiment. </para>

                                <para>- Yes j but that was because of the recommendation of the protective section of the Tariff Commission, and because also sheep dips were free under the old Tariff. It seems to me that a large number of people are anti-Australian, and are prepared to obtain what they want anywhere but in the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>-351- - The concluding observations of the Treasurer must commend themselves to the Committee ; but I certainly do not appreciate the arguments he used at the outset of his speech. He is accustomed to resort to them when he does not get his own way, and to insinuate that .those who are opposed to him are anti-Australian. By what process of reasoning he arrives at the conclusion that he is a better Australian than those, who happen fo differ with him on the Tariff I do not know, and to use such an argument is only to be offensive. As to the item itself, I think that sheep dips and disinfectants should be free. New discoveries are constantly being made, and there should be no obstacle in the way of the introduction of any improved disinfectant or insecticide into Australia. Our climatic conditions are such that we have to fight against pests of all kinds, which attack both live stock and plant life, and I am of opinion that it would not be in the interests of the country to impose a duty on sheep dips, insecticides, and disinfectants. The honorable member for Laanecoorie has said that local manufacturers ,of these articles are able to sell their products at one- third less than the price charged for the imported article. That being so, it cannot be said that they need protection. The protectionist section of the Tariff Commission recommended that sheep dips should be free, and, as has been pointed out, the proposal in the first Federal Tariff that the duty should be  15  per cent, was rejected. I hope that the item will stand as printed. </para>

It has been suddenly sprung on the Committee, and we have no opportunity to inquire into its probable effect. Sheep wash is used to a large extent to improve the quality of the wool, and so to increase its value. If the manufacture of disinfectants in Australia were an extensive industry, I should be in favour of granting a reasonable duty. </para>

                            <para>-- 1  have listened with interest to the arguments on this item. What sheep-owners require is not a cheap, but an effective sheep dip, one which will do the work required of it. Any quantity of cheap disinfectants might be poured into a drain or sewer, but if they were not effective for the purpose of destroying the bacillus of typhoid, the spread of the disease would not be checked. I am inclined in this matter' to support the proposed duty in order to secure the preparation of an efficient sheep dip in Australia. If such an article were manufactured here, local, competition would regulate the price, and if it were found that local manufacturers formed a trust or combine to keep up prices, I should be willing to have the Government take over the whole business. It is most important that our people should be in a position to. obtain reliable medicines of all kinds and effective disinfectants, and in this connexion the Government might well be asked to interfere in the interests of the health of the people, as well as of the progress of our industries. Money spent upon ineffective disinfectants is only thrown away. With a view to having this preparation made under local supervision, I shall support the proposed duty. At the same time, I ask the Treasurer to give consideration to the question pf requiring every package of imported disinfectants to be accompanied by a certificate as to the nature and strength of the preparations. It is quite time that we dealt a blow at the importation of the rubbish which is introduced in the form of chemical preparations. </para>

                            <para>.- The arguments of the honorable member for New England would be efficacious if used in opposition to the duty. The honorable member is quite right in saying that what sheep-owners require is not a cheap, but an effective sheep dip. I suppose it is on that account that imported disinfectants are able to find a sale. We have been informed that locally manufactured disinfectants are sold at 4s. per gallon, whilst the imported article is sold at from 5s. to 6s. per gallon. This shows that what is wanted is not increased protection through the Tariff. No matter what may be added to the price of the imported article, those who prefer it will continue to use it. </para>

                                <para>- If the manufacturer who requires to use the best iron believes the imported article to be the best, he will buy it. When we find that the local article is sold for two-thirds of the price asked for the imported article, we must look to some means other than a protective duty to force the. local article upon the market against the will of the consumer. I protested the other night against the Treasurer springing new items on the Committee, and I now repeat the protest. It is utterly impossible for honorable members to deal properly with this question on the spur of the moment. The result of the imposition of the proposed duty will probably be to force people to use tobacco disinfectant, since we have already agreed that tobacco used in the manufacture of sheep dip is to be admitted free. </para>

                            <para>-- I" common with other honorable members, I think it is rather a pity that this new item should have been sprung upon the Committee at the last moment, when honorable members have no opportunity to sufficiently consider it. When, as in this case, both the Government and the Tariff Commission propose that an article shall be admitted free, honorable members are justified in assuming that the item will go through in that form, and are, therefore, not likely to look into the question. Consistently with my protectionist principles, I always lend a ready ear to any argument in support of the establishment and development of Australian industries. The arguments put forward in this instance have influenced me to a certain extent, but not sufficiently to induce me to support the duties proposed by the Treasurer. The honorable gentleman proposes a duty of 2s. per gallon, and of 10s. per cwt. on powder disinfectants. I think these duties should be reduced by one half. I am sorry that the item should have been brought forward in the way it has been, and. while I am prepared to support a reasonable duty of, say, is. per gallon, I am opposed to the present proposal of the Minister. </para>

                            <para>.- The arguments used by the honorable member for New England are futile. I can see ' no justification whatever for the imposition of a duty upon a sheep dip mixture or any other form of disinfectant. It should not be forgotten that the interests of the country are bound up with the interests of the stock industry. Honorable members must be aware that all sorts of pests are constantly threatening those engaged in that industry. It is not so long ago since we had to face the tick pest, and had to discover a dip to deal with it effectively. </para>

                                <para>- I am glad that we did not have to import it while the present Government were in power, because it is very likely that we should have had to pay a duty of 5s. per gallon on it. We have here a sweeping provision to impose a heavy tax on dip mixtures which might be. patented elsewhere, but which the owners of stock might be obliged to get. It is difficult to discover the most effective mixture for certain purposes, and it took some years of experimental work to discover an effective dip for the tick pest. The Government propose an absolutely prohibitive tax, and even the duty of is. per gallon suggested by the honorable member for Wimmera would be much too high. It. would mean a duty of 5s. on a 5-gallon drum of what might be a patent mixture. Many honorable members in this House have a knowledge of the rearing of stock, and they know what the effect of such a duty is likely to be. The big squatters are not the persons who will have to suffer. They would probably be in a position to afford to pay something extra for an effective dip, but it is the people who are engaged in dairying and small sheep farmers whom the Treasurer is proposing to tax. There seems to be an idea that the only people concerned in stock-raising in this country are wealthy squatters. The day when that was so has long gone by. Those who will feel this tax are the small farmers and dairymen. </para>

                            <para>. - I am astonished at the Treasurer's action in proposing a duty on this item. It amounts on some phenyle preparations to a duty of over 50 per cent., as the invoice price in some cases is 3s. 6d. a gallon. Phenyle preparations are used not only for keeping stock clean and healthy, but also largely for sanitary purposes around dwellings. The duty on liquid disinfectants -would exclude such preparations as Calvert's carbolic acid, of which large quantities are used for disinfecting drains. </para>

The proposal to put a duty on liquid sheep washes raises the question of the- great necessity throughout Australia for the proper dipping of sheep, in order to preserve our principal industry. These patent sheep washes, both liquid and powder, are used more by the smaller farmer than by any one else, because it is usual for the big; stations to prepare their own sheep dips, using arsenic, soft soap and sulphur. The small farmer uses these patent preparations in a handy form. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member is wrong. I have seen them in my district with their small dips, lifting the sheep in and out one at a time. So important is this process to the whole industry, that they will go to all that trouble. If we impose this duty Australia will be in the unique position of being the only country in the world that taxes preparations of this kind. Russia, one of the most conservative countries ' admits dips like Cooper's free, because it is for the national good. They are admitted free in the Argentine. America, -which is often held up as one of the most protected countries in the world, admits Cooper's sheep dip free. If the Treasurer had given the people of Australia time to consider this matter, he would have been as eager to take the duty off as he was to take it off wirenetting. </para>

                                <para>- This question is similar to that of wire-netting - it is a case of keeping out pests. The Treasurer, who is an able representative of one of the largest and most important rural constituencies, now actually proposes a duty on something which is used to the .advantage of every man who earns his living on the land. Phenyles are used as a wash for poultry, sheep, horses and dogs, and also as household disinfectants. </para>

                                <para>- Then presumably the duty of as. per gallon was only proposed for amusement.  The honorable member for Melbourne Ports says " We will climb down." How many new honorary Ministers have recently been added to the Cabinet? Other important articles included in the Treasurer's proposal are insecticides and sheep branding preparations. We have already dealt with some forms of sheep branding preparations under other items. A duty of 2s. per gallon on these patent preparations amounts to over 20 per cent. At the same time, they are made from secret formulae, and therefore cannot be made or sold here. We could not possibly manufacture Cooper's dip and sell it as such, or make the same article and sell it under another name. All sheep dips are not alike, but Cooper's dip is unique. Its use has considerably increased the value of our great national asset. The local preparations can be bought for one-third less than can the imported. Surely, then, there is no necessity for a duty. I suggest that these articles should be allowed to come in free as before. I hope honorable members realize that if we impose this duty we shall be going far' beyond what has been done in either Russia or America. </para>

                            <para>.-^ Springing a proposal of this kind on the Committee without notice is not calculated to assist our deliberations and, further, I see no justification for imposing the duty proposed by the Treasurer. The arguments this afternoon show that if there are any articles in the Tariff that should be made free they are the articles now under discussion. When we consider the value of some pf these disinfectants to the community, it is bordering on a criminal act to impose a duty amounting to 50 per cent, or over. The result of making a proposal of this kind without notice is that several hours have been occupied in its discussion. </para>

                            <para>.  - At an earlier stage of the debate, I said that the Treasurer knew ' as much about stock as any man in Australia. At that time, however, I thought it was the honorable gentleman's intention to make this article free, but shortly afterwards I discovered that he proposed to impose a duty ; and that, of course, very much altered my opinion of him. I may inform the Committee that in South Africa all such requisites are carried free over the Government railways : and I think that example might be very well followed here, instead of increasing the cost by imposing a duty. Some years ago I was induced to try one of the new dips, but three months afterwards I found the sheep as though they had never been treated at all ; and I had to go back to the well-tried article. If sheep are not thoroughly dipped the wool will be reduced to nearly half its value ; and that, of course, is a very serious matter. I hope the Committee will not vote the proposed duty. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member for Capricornia. Then we have it from the honorable member for Corangamite that squatters make their own dip; and, as that is a fact, it shows that there is no virtue in sheep dip which cannot be attained in Australia. We have been further told that the locally-made article is not equivalent to the imported article ; but I have before me the formula of both Quibell's and Burnet's sheep dip. In the imported article, the tar oil is only  30  per cent., as against  33  per cent. in the locally-made article ; carbolic acid is  15  per cent., as against  18  per cent. ; soda is  7  per cent., as against  8  per cent. ; water is  32  per cent., as against  23  per cent. ; and resin is  16  per cent., as against  18  per cent. respectively. In every case but water the percentage is higher ; and the local dip has been tested and found to be not so strong as to be injurious. The wider sale of the imported sheep dip is due, not to superior quality, but to more judicious advertising, by which people are easily influenced. </para>

Anything that promotes the brilliancy of wool ought to receive earnest attention from this Committee, seeing that the wool industry is the backbone of the Commonwealth. But for the wool industry, I do not know what the people of the cities would do for a living. Thank goodness, in Western Queensland the sheep are free from diseases which prevail elsewhere, and sheep wash has not been regarded as necessary. But I am told that, in order to promote brilliancy in the wool, it is intended to resort to dipping. This fact ought to be taken into consideration, and attention paid to this primary industry, as well as to the manufacturing industries in the cities. </para>

                            <para>.- I am very sorry that I did not hear the Minister's explanation, as I was making an inquiry of the Comptroller-General regarding the statement of the honorable member for Parramatta. I understood the latter to say that he had been assured by a chemist that the Commonwealth Government had passed a regulation which restricted the quantity of opium to be sold by any chemist in a particular time.I have been assured by the Comptroller-General that it has not been done. I question the validity of such a regulation. </para>

                                <para>- Certainly. I ask the Treasurer if he will see that the regulation is so altered as to extend to medical institutes and dispensaries which are conducted by duly qualified chemists the same privilege which is now enjoyed by other chemists.. I do not think he can fairly object to the request. In Sydney and suburbs alone the regulation affects 25,000 poor persons connected with friendly societies. </para>

                            <para>. - My only reason for hesitation about this matter was that I felt that the opium traffic ought to be restricted to the fullest extent. When the matter was before me as Minister of Trade and Customs I was very particular in endeavouring to restrict the traffic in every way. I hold to the terms of the proclamation that I issued at that time. If what is asked for  can be done without running any risk of opening the door to the increased consumption of opium for other than medicinal purposes, I will advise that it shall be done. That is all that I can say. I hesitate to do anything suddenly which may open the door wider, because opium smoking is undoubtedly an awful curse, and I have always done my best to stop it. </para>

The Department of Trade and Customs made certain regulations as to the importation of opium. They considered that in order to carry out their regulations effectively they ought to be able to trace the opium to the place where it was. consumed. They endeavour to do that in every case. </para>

                                <para>- I do not say whether it was right or wrong, but it did not work well. Where the Customs found that a certain amount of opium, which they considered excessive, was going in a certain direction - say to a country chemist - they drew the attention of the wholesale chemists to the fact and said, " If this goes on we will not allow you to import." The Department put the screw on the wholesale men, who in turn put the screw on the retailers. The effect was that they apportioned out what they thought was a fair consumption, prescribing how much John Brown, a country chemist, or John Robinson, a town chemist, ought to sell in a certain time. In other words, they endeavoured to determine what was a legitimate medicinal use of opium in any particular place. Now, the dispensary in Parramatta serves a very large district, and the restriction imposed by the Department of Trade and Customs, or by the wholesale importers under pressure from the Department, had this effect. The allowance made to the Parramatta Dispensary was so small that in about a fortnight they had used in doctors' prescriptions the amount of opium they were allowed to use for a whole quarter. </para>

                                <para>- They were allowed a certain amount for a quarter, which they used in about a fortnight. The consequence was that the dispensary could not properly dispense the doctors' prescriptions. I drew the attention of the Minister to this matter about six months ago, and he directed that the regulations should be altered so as to allow greater latitude and to insure that the legitimate use of opium would not be hampered. I believe that something has been done in that direction. I inquired the other day of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Button,</inline> the secretary of the dispensary, and he told me that they were now allowed the opium they wanted. I presume, therefore, that the Minister of Trade and Customs has altered the regulation. I am as keen as the Treasurer, or any one else can be, to stop the use of opium absolutely for any but medicinal purposes. But it is such an alleviate of pain that the legitimate use of it should not be hampered in any way when prescribed by doctors. </para>

                            <para>.- I think that the Treasurer is perfectly right in safeguarding, so far as he can, against the illegitimate use of. opium. I also recognise that no arbitrary regulation can be framed to fit all cases of chemists selling opium? What I think should be done is, to allow a certain amount of discretion to the responsible officers of the Department: to deal with cases on their merits. For instance, where it is known that there is a large Chinese settlement, or that there is an unusually large amount of opium going into a certain district, there would be a legitimate case for interference if there was reason to believe that the limits of ordinary medicinal uses were being exceeded. But, in addition to the demands of dispensaries and friendly societies and institutes, I point out that abnormally large quantities of opium are used by chemists who happen to have large veterinary customers. I happen to have one in my own electorate who is in that position, and who uses as much opium in a week as a chemist in another part of the country would use in a year. </para>

                            <para>The Acting Collector of Customs of New South Wales has issued the following memorandum to the licensed importers of opium :  -  " In future, any licensed importer of opium or extract of opium shall be held responsible for the supply of any retail pharmacist of any of the drugs mentioned in excess of the following quantities per annum : - Gum opium, 4 ozs. ; solid extract of opium,  2  ozs. ; liquid extract of opium, 5 ozs.; tincture opium,  2  quarts. In addition] besides keeping books, such licensee shall supply the Department with a monthly -statement, showing the quantity of opium and its .preparations imported and manufactured, with a list of the names and addresses of persons to whom such preparations, &amp;c, were sold and the quantities supplied." </para>
                        </quote>
                        <para class="block">A great many chemists sell much larger quantities of opium per week than is mentioned in that memorandum. Naturally, the issue of it caused a considerable amount of consternation. The honorable member for Nepean and the right honorable member for East Sydney, brought the matter up in Parliament. Thereupon, the following memorandum was issued by the Minister of Trade and Customs - </para>

                            <para>There is no restriction to the <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> use of opium preparations for medicinal purposes. It was, however, found that special vigilance is imperatively necessary, in order that the supplies should not be diverted to improper purposes. Inquiry was made as to the fair average Quantities ordinarily required each year by chemists, and the Department was advised that such average quantities were : - Gum opium, ^ lb. ; solid extract,  2  ozs. ; liquid extract,  5  ozs. ; tincture of opium,  2  quarts. The collectors were advised" so that the above should afford a guide to trade requirements, and aid them in supervising -the .distribution. That this was absolutely necessary may be realized from the fact that in one case we found a country chemist being supplied with over  2  lb. in weight of extract of opium each fortnight. In regard to three chemists, whose supplies prior to July, 1906, did not reach 1 lb. each year, we found they were supplied bv licensed importers as follows for nine months ending 31st March last : - No. 1, 36^ lbs., about 1 lb. per week; No.  2,  47^ lbs., about i£ lbs. ner week; No. 3,  22  lbs., about f lb. per week. It is obvious these quantities were not required for legitimate purposes, and the action recently taken is to insist upon those persons who are licensed to import opium exercising every reasonable precaution, so that the law may be observed. The Minister has already decided that if he finds reasonable care is not exercised bv any persons licensed to import opium" for medicinal purposes, he will not hesitate to cancel the licence. It will be quite impossible to give effect to the desire to suppress the evil of opium smoking if the irregularities drawn attention to were permitted. </para>

                        <para>This was the effect of the protest made by the honorable member for Nepean and the right honorable member for East Svdney. </para>
                        <para class="block">As regards the question whether the duty is too high, I point out that it operates as almost a prohibitive impost on a number of proprietary lines, containing only an infinitesimal quantity of opium. The duty is therefore hardly fair to the ordinary consumers of opium medicinally. It certainly is not right to tax the users of a  proprie.tary  article to the full extent of the amount of opium contained in the preparation. The duty will press hardly upon friendly societies. </para>

                            <para>. - I hope that the Committee will agree to this amendment. Twenty per cent. is the old rate. The Treasurer, in regard to other items, has been very careful to insist upon' the fact that he has followed the recommendations of the A section of the Tariff Commission, and I therefore point out that it was the unanimous recommendation of both sections that the old duty should be retained in this case. Moreover, the Minister has consented to a reduction of the general rate from  35  to  30  per cent. ; and as he originally proposed a preferential difference of  10  per cent. in favour of Great Britain, he should, to be consistent, agree to this amendment in order that that preference may remain. He has offered no explanation of his reasons for putting aside the recommendation of the Tariff Commission. </para>

                                <para>- Strong opposition was expressed months ago to the imposition of a duty of 7s. 6d. each on chairs, and a few hours are of importance to a man who has a thousand chairs in bond and wishes to get them out in time for the Christmas trade. The item is not much affected by. the duties on timber, and we should deal with it before we deal with those duties. If the Treasurer would agree to place chairs, lounges and settees in one item it could be dealt with in five minutes. </para>

                            <para>.- I hope that item  301  will not be postponed. I brought it under the notice of honorable members months and months ago. I showed that the increase of duty involved an increase in the amount payable on one shipment to Fremantle from  ^76  to £1,000 odd. As a result, the chairs included in that shipment are still in bond. </para>

                                <para>- The Treasurer is the cause of the talking, by proposing to postpone the consideration of the item. After what the importers of chairs have had to put up with the motion to postpone the consideration of the item is a disgraceful proposition. They had a right to expect that, at least, when we came to the item in the ordinary way we - would deal with it, and now the Treasurer asks us to postpone it. I hope that the Committee will not permit the postponement of the item. </para>

If the Committee is to take the control of business out of the hands of the Government we should know it at once. If I were making an unreasonable request I should not object to the opposition to it, but when I was asked to take the timber duties before furniture I considered the request a reasonable one. I hope that we shall be able to deal with all these duties to-night. </para>

                                <para>- That settles it; I suppose. I point out that the honorable gentleman could deal with it . now without any debate whatever. There is bound to be considerable debate on the duties proposed in connexion with general furniture, and a very long debate on the timber duties is inevitable. This item of chairs might be taken at once, and dealt with almost without debate. It is one which we singled out weeks ago as being of an urgent character. The importers of chairs have had to keep them in bond. They have been out of their money during all this _ time, and their business has been injured. In the circumstances, is it fair that now, when we have reached the item in the ordinary way, it should be postponed until some other items are dealt with? I think the Minister's proposal is a most unreasonable one. </para>

If they were treated as ordinary furniture with a duty of 30 or 40 per cent., there would be no trouble. </para>

                                <para>- Assuming that some honorable members did ask. the Treasurer that the items dealing with furniture should be postponed, I say that item' 301 is treated differently from the other items of furniture. In this Tariff, chairs are treated separately, and dealt with in a way, the reason for which no one, with the exception, perhaps, of the Treasurer, is able to understand. I am certain that the Treasurer intends to reduce the proposed duties on his own motion, and why can he not do it now. I feel bound to vote with the honorable member for Bass if he pushes his objection to the postponement of these items to a division. </para>

I appeal to the Minister in a friendly way to give us an opportunity of determining the question of whether 7 s. 6d. each shall be charged as an alternative to the duty on chairs. We could probably deal with the matter within ten minutes. I make the appeal, because as far back as the 30th August last I "made a strong request on remonstrances against the duties put before me that item 301 should be taken at once, and at the time Ministers were inclined to accept that suggestion. It was subsequently pointed out that it would perhaps be better to wait until the item came on in the ordinary course. Now we have reached ;t, and this very day I have received communications from Adelaide with respect to the item. It is pointed out that importers cannot take their chairs out of bond, and are actually threatened with law suits for the non-fulfilment of orders-. </para>

I mentioned to several honorable members on this side that there was a probability of the Minister proposing to postpone the furniture items until after the timber duties, because the furniture duties would hinge largely on what was done in the case of timber. There seems, however, to have been a slight misapprehension, as some of those to whom I spoke thought that it was proposed to postpone only the item "Furniture." I did not understand it so, although other honorable members did. </para>

                            <para>.- I thoroughly approve of the Treasurer's generalization, embracing, as it does,- in a comprehensive manner every possible description of furniture. It is a very convenient and logical description of furniture, and is better than the minute specification of a large number of articles in detail. I think a duty of 30 per cent, all round is quite sufficient. Although the Treasurer proposes a generalized description in this item, I am disposed to think that lounges, settees, and chairs should be separately dealt with, so that the Committee may have an opportunity of giving a straight-out vote in those cases. The reason why the specific duties' on those articles, apparently high on the* face of them, were proposed, was because the Tariff Commission were informed that most of the articles of this description came from cheap labour countries, such as China, where they were turned out at such a dirt-cheap rate that an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty of 30 per cent, would be practically useless and inoperative. </para>

Some of the lounges and chairs coming from these countries would take any man three days to make, and 25 per cent, <inline font-style="italic">(ad valorem),</inline> say, on a lounge with three days' work on it, invoiced at 5s. in Canton, scarcely alters the price of it here, as we have seen them sold at 12s. 6d. to 15s., including all costs.

I hope the Treasurer will accept the suggestion of the honorable member for Corio, and place furniture for hospitals under a different heading. Not all hospitals are subsidized from the public Treasury, and great difficulty is experienced in conducting them on the public subscriptions which are raised by the utmost efforts of the committees of management. </para>

When it is clearly shown that the goods are for a public institution, conducted on charitable lines, every facility should be given for obtaining them at the lowest possible cost.

                                <para>- I do not think that any arrangement of the kind suggested would cause any committee of management to resort to direct importation; the quantity of furniture required at any one time is never sufficiently large to' make such a plan payable. Just imagine, in the case of a country hospital, struggling- for existence, the committee proceeding to directly import one or two lounges ! If a hospital committee went to a local dealer, would the duty be refunded on the particular article sold? The common experience is that committees of management, when purchasing furniture, do not ask. whether the goods are made by Chinese or black labour, but simply purchase what they require. As a matter of fact, most of the furniture used in hospitals is locally made, because it is then possible to get articles made to order. I should be very glad, indeed, to do anything to assist the hospitals ; but I  fail altogether to see how any assistance can be rendered in the way suggested by the  honorable member for Coolgardie. In my opinion, it is a mistake to have the word " hospital " mentioned, because it may only tend to lead subscribers and others to believe that some relief is tq be given when no relief is possible. </para>

                            <para>.- I do not think that the Committee need concern itself very much about the question which has been raised by the honorable member for Coolgardie. My own experience in connexion with hospitals is that those institutions are never called upon to pay anything like the retail price for the furniture which they require. The liberality of our merchants prevents that.  In order to overcome the difficulty, I would suggest that a new line should be added  to this item to read, " Chairs, the product of coloured labour, each 7s. 6d." </para>

                                <para>- I shall presently show the honorable member the difference between ordinary furniture and hospital furniture. These institutions are established primarily for the purpose of assisting the suffering and the needy, and it would be unwise on our part to add to the  cost of their maintenance. The honorable member for Robertson, I am sorry to say, did not appear to know very much about this subject, because he stated that all the requirements of hospitals in the matter of furniture would be met by the occasional mending of a wheel chair, or something of that sort. In his own electorate there has recently been erected a cottage hospital which has been equipped in modern fashion. The furniture which it contains is of a special class, and has been designed for a special purpose. It is what is known as aseptic furniture. It hms recently been discovered that many of our surgical diseases are aggravated by the presence of germs in the atmosphere, and it is with a. view to combating these germs that furniture of this special type has been introduced. It is usually made of iron enamelled and glass. Every up-to-date hospital erected since this new theory was adopted has been furnished in this style. Nevertheless, the demand for this class of furniture is exceedingly small, and consequently it does not pay to manufacture it locally. The greater portion of it is imported, and will continue to be imported for many years. Let me instance the ordinary table which is used by surgeons in operating theatres. In some respects it is a very simple contrivance, whilst in others it is a very intricate one. Many of these tables are patented, so that it is impossible to manufacture them in Australia. </para>

                                <para>- But if the merchants charge the hospitals only the wholesale price why should they be specially taxed for their philanthropy ? There is too much of that sort of thing in connexion with our public institutions. I am perfectly satisfied that the Treasurer will consent to the admission of hospital furniture free. I claim that it may fairly be included in the same category as surgical appliances. We need not be afraid that Chinamen will manufacture it, because it is altogether beyond their capacity to do so. It requires to be made by specialists. I would also point out that this furniture is extremely expensive. Only the other day a new hospital was erected in my own electorate, and the cost of equipping it was so heavy that a special call had to be made upon the inhabitants of the district. They responded by organizing two race meetings, the profits of which were about £400, and with this money the operating theatre was furnished.. There is practically no country in the world where hospital furniture is dutiable. I again urge upon the Committee that it should be placed upon the free list, so that the cost of maintaining our hospitals, which are almost entirely dependent upon public subscriptions, shall not be increased. </para>

I say there is an immediate danger from Java with respect to the furniture trade. "3y the furniture trade, as I have explained to the Commission, I do not mean fancy furniture, but every-day articles, such as chairs and tables, wardrobes, office-desks, and similar things. I know, of my own knowledge, they are preparing now to enter into competition here. T say also it is impossible for us to compete with them under the present Tariff of 2.5  per cent. That refers to Java only. The wood is teak, which is very cheap, and a very high class of wood. I also explained to the Commission that during my last visit to Java I met an Australian merchant there, who was on the spot preparing to introduce the furniture here. </para>

This witness also said that he had seen women with children on their backs engaged in loading ships. If we could get this duty imposed it would give employment to hundreds of men. The machinery, has been ordered, and is on its way to the Commonwealth for the purpose of making a large quantity of this furniture. I hope that honorable members will give favorable consideration to the testimony of an independent witness who is not a Victorian or a New South Wales man, nor interested in a factory. I trust that they will give to this industry the protection it is entitled to receive. </para>

We are now dealing with a line of articles which practically enter into every home which has any pretensions to decency and civilization. This duty if imposed will fall upon a very large section of the community. Under this Tariff the poorer classes who are compelled by their needs to buy the cheaper lines of furniture will have to contribute to a larger extent towards the revenue. The proposed minimum duty of  7s.  6d. per chair means that a number of the more expensive chairs- will probably cost twice as much as they do. But a large percentage of the chairs which are used by the working people do not cost much more than about half that sum. It means that the burden of this taxation will fall upon those who are least able to bear it, and who should receive some consideration at our hands. The honorable member for Bendigo has informed the Committee how. these high duties came to. be proposed. </para>

They said that Australia was suffering from or threatened with competition from the East of such a character that the imposition of high duties was absolutely essential to maintain the Australian industry. The position was stated as one Chinaman making one chair per day at a wage of 4d. competing with a white man making one chair per day at 6s. It was asked, was it possible under those conditions for white people to compete with importations from the East. The honorable member did not state the extent of the competition or quote the figures derived from the Customs returns. I hold in my hand a return prepared by the Commonwealth Statistician and giving the figures for last year. </para>

                                <para>- After this Tariff has passed through the House, I am very much afraid that the honorable member will have to pay that. According to this return, which covers all descriptions of furniture, the total importations for 1906 amounted to £244,355. Only about £24,572 worth came from the East, namely, £8,577 from Hong Kong, £1,146 from the Straits Settlements, £878 from China., and £13,971 worth from Japan. The new bogey which has been raised by the honorable member for Batman - Java - is not mentioned in the return. </para>

                                <para>- I had not noticed the figures for Java. At any rate, that is an item which the Commonwealth can very well disregard. In 1906 £219,000 or £220,000 worth of this furniture was imported from European countries, Great Britain sending £102,000 worth, and Germany £63,000 worth ; while from the United States we imported £46,000 worth. That is a complete reply, I think, to the scare which was raised before the Tariff Commission, and which may be raised here as to the competition from eastern countries. I remind the Committee that the competition is in a line of articles which do not enter very largely into general use. It relates chiefly to cane and wickerwork chairs, settees, and articles of that description which are not used for the general purposes to which the kinds of furniture under consideration are adapted. </para>

                        <para class="block">The chair which is more commonly used now is a bentwood chair known as the Austrian chair, but not necessarily made in that country. It is practically the only description of chair which is suitable to the varying temperatures which obtain in the Commonwealth. To place a duty of 7 s. 6d. on a chair of that class is simply to prohibit its use, and to inflict a great burden on a large section of the citizens. The amendment foreshadowed by the Treasurer is certainly an improvement on the item as it stands, and will, I hope, be adopted. I trust that a very reasonable reduction will be made, and that the specific duty will be replaced by an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty, because the former places a very heavy burden on those who are compelled to buy the cheaper descriptions of chairs. </para>

                                <para>- I intend to put the case for chairs before the Committee, and to show that they differ from other furniture on account of the cost of packing. Some honorable members have spoken about the poor shopkeepers who have had thousands of cases of chairs kept in bond. Now, if a shopkeeper is in such a. position as to have thousands of cases of chairs consigned to him, he is by no means a poor man. There are four dozen chairs in each case. </para>

                                <para>- I do not know; but freight went down below 5s. per ton measurement recently. Goods were brought out at that figure, not only to Melbourne, but also to Sydney. There is no trade in which labour represents so large a proportion to the value of the article as it does in regard to furniture. If we take the timber as it stands in the forest,, and consider the amount of labour expended upon it before it takes its place as furniture in the. homes of the rich or of the poor, or in the hospital, we shall find that the labour in some cases represents  95  per cent, of the value of the article. </para>

                                <para>- Take the honorable member's suit of clothes. From the raw wool to the suit of clothes, the labour cost does not represent anything near the same percentage as the proportion of labour involved in furniture, from the timber to the finished article, although wool is a more valuable product to start with than timber is. I regret that the Government have not seen fit to adhere to their original proposal. The Tariff Commission went carefully into this matter, and the  Chairman  has told us that the chairs they had in mind in making their recommendation for a duty of  7s. 6d.  per chair were the cheap chairs that are imported into this country from places like China and Japan. Speaking of furniture generally, honorable members who have taken the trouble to look into the figures, will have observed that the imports have increased during the last three years. In  1904,  the imports were valued at  ,£181,620;  in  1905,  they went up to  ,£201,284;  and in  1906,  to  £212,526.  It may be said that there has been an increase in local manufacture, but I think we are entitled to have the whole of this trade for the benefit of Australian workmen. I believe that Australians have a greater right to share in the prosperity of this country than any foreigner has, no matter where he may be domiciled. </para>

                                <para>- No; I have always been in favour of securing the trade for the white workman. There is not to-day, and there has not been, a Chinaman employed in the only chair factory in Melbourne, which, I am given to understand, is the only chair factory pure and simple in the Commonwealth. Of course, any cabinetmaker can make a chair, but not at a price to compete with articles imported at very low figures. An invoice has been handed to me by the honorable member for Batman, which shows the low price of imported chairs. Messrs. John A. Dunn's chairs, imitation walnut, imitation rosewood, imitation mahogany, and imitation antique oak, are sold at <inline font-style="italic">j£i</inline> us.  3d.  per dozen f.o.b., New York. Chairs in natural oak, antique oak and English oak, are sold at <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> 15s. sd.  per dozen f.o.b., New York. I admit that the duty proposed on chairs is probably the highest duty in the Tariff. But that does not frighten me. </para>

I am a family man myself, and I do not think I have all the chairs that I shall require if I live much longer, as I have no doubt that my children will break chairs.

                                <para>- The value of the imports from Japan was £14,194; and from China, £7,489. We can, at any rate, deal with the Chinaman whom we have in this country; but we cannot deal with the Chinaman in China. We have no control over the conditions under which he lives and works. In Victoria, we have endeavoured, by means of our Factories Act, to insure that the Chinaman shall receive the same wages as are paid to Europeans. According to their employers, they receive more; although I and many others, especially those in the trade, doubt this. </para>

                                <para>- I say nothing about that, because the Javanese competition does not appear to be very great according to these figures. From Great Britain we imported £60,000 worth, and from Austria £16,000 worth, of the total of £212,000 worth of furniture, and I have not the slightest doubt that by far the greater proportion of that furniture could be made here. </para>

                                <para>- According to the export returns for last year we sent away a great deal more than we got in return. We do not receive in return the full amount of the goods that we send out. I hope the Committee will agree to the duties on general furniture proposed by the Government - 40 per cent. and 30 per cent. If I could get a majority to vote with me, I would support a duty of 40 per cent. all round. I have never said that I was going for preferential trade; or, rather,I would vote for preferential trade in precisely the same way as free-traders do. They vote for preferential trade to reduce duties, and I will vote for preferential trade if by so doing I can increase them. If I can only get a comparatively small duty against Great Britain, and a large duty against other countries, I am to that extent a preferential trader. But I did not try to get elected on the preferential trade ticket. My attitude is perfectly clear on that subject. </para>

                                <para>- I have nothing to say against the Mother Country. I had as good a time when I was there as most Australians have. But we are now considering the interests of Australia. I trust the Committee will recollect that by far the larger part of the cost of furniture goes in labour, and, further, that it is a highly skilled trade, and that in that respect it is a more important industry than any other. It is true that the furniture trade in this State is to-day practically monopolized by the Chinese. If I had my way I would impose a heavy Excise duty against them. If we could impose an Excise on Chinese furniture, as we have done against black labour sugar, I would heartily welcome such a proposal. </para>

                                <para>- The difficulty is to enforce a Wages Board determination, or an Arbitration Court award, in the case of Chinamen. No matter how fair the decision of the Judge may be, if the employer and employe like to act in collusion the award can be broken down. That is what I fear is being done in regard to the furniture trade. About 500 Chinese are employed in the furniture industry in Victoria. We have been told by the honorable member for Dalley, in one of his lectures, that we should not go outside the reports of the Tariff Commission for our information. </para>

                            <para>The furniture that cannot be made locally is bent work, though chairs are produced in Australia that take the place of bent wood chairs to a great extent. One of the greatest troubles is the Chinese competition. This, in conjunction with the imports, leaves very little for the white  cabinetmakers  in Australia to do. There are factories in Melbourne which used to employ numbers of men in making furniture, but which employ none now. In New South Wales the trade has been saved somewhat by the piano factory being established. A great number of furniture makers are now employed at that work. They wanted more duty and fewer Chinese. </para>

                            <para>.- The honorable member for Yarra has spoken with great vigour, as, he always does, in favour of high duties on furniture. He might appropriately have said, in the language of Macbeth - " This line ' will chair me ever, or disseat me now.' " Although he asks for more protection to the furniture trade, I have evidence that in South Australia that trade is in a very flourishing condition. He has read <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mathias'</inline> evidence, and I would accept <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mathias'</inline> statements, even if they were not sworn, because I know his character and ability. He is managing a factory which was started under him a few years ago, about  3  miles from Adelaide, and did so well under the old Tariff that it can scarcely cope with its orders. It turns out a tip-top article, with the result that its output has increased enormously, and I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mathias</inline> would he able to find work for  50  or  100  hands to-morrow, at high wages, if the  honorable  member for Yarra could supply them to him. </para>

                            <para>Referring to the policy of a high Tariff upon chairs and upon furniture generally, the trade desires to point out that the equipment of the manufacturing trade, though large and increasing, is quite . unsuitable to adequately increase the supply of locally-made goods. In men alone, the trade is most seriously deficient, and every State is competing with every other, almost unsuccessfully, to obtain men. In an instance of which I have personal knowledge, the largest manufacturer in Adelaide has had an order for twenty-four dozen chairs of one pattern for over five weeks, and has only succeeded, after serious delay, in delivering half-a-dozen, and subsequently a few more, whilst there is no prospect in sight of obtaining sufficient for pressing needs. This kind of difficulty has been chronic for over twelve months with regard, also to all furniture. </para>

                        <para class="block">As a matter of fact, I believe that it does not pay to manufacture in Australia chairs of the kind upon which a duty of 7 s. 6d. each has been imposed. Such chairs will not be made here  for many years to come ; one of the reasons being that,, with skilled labour so scarce, it is more profitable to employ men in making better-class furniture. There is a great disparity between the wages paid in Austria and America, from which countries most of these chairs come - or in Japan - from which there- is a small importation - and those paid in Australia. It does not pay the Australian manufacturers who have a big business in better-class furniture to make chairs which are exported for 2s. nd. each. </para>

                                <para>- Ten firms have quoted the f.o.b. price to me as 2s. rid. each. As regards the proposed duty of 7s. 6d. each, I will quote the figures of two invoices, which show how unfair it is. The value of twenty-seven chairs imported was £7 7s. 9d., on which the old duty would have been £1 2s. 5d.. but on which the new duty will come to £10 2s. 6d. On 888 other chairs, valued at £183 8s., the old duty of 29 per cent, would have been £42 2s., whilst the new duty of 7s. 6d. each will be £333- Should such a duty as that be allowed to remain? My opinion is that the furniture trade, which is a flourishing one, would be fairly treated if an all round duty of 25 per cent, were imposed. </para>

The more I see of the reports- signed by the  Chairman  of the Tariff Commission, the more surprised I am at the manner in which they have been framed in respect to the evidence upon which they have been based. To-day we were informed that one witness told the Commission that Australian manufacturers could not compete against importations from China and Japan ; that in </para>

                        <para class="block">China, men got 4d. for making a chair, while here they would get 6s. That statement was, on the face of it, absurd. Who would pay 6s. for the making of a chair which could not be sold in the open market for more 'than 3s. 6d. ? Such statements carry their own refutation. Yet the  Chairman  of the Tariff Commission has built up his reports on them, and has made them the ground for recommending high . duties. There is very little furniture imported from the countries I have named, only £8,000 worth coming from China; and £[14,000 worth from Japan, or £22,000 worth altogether from the East; while from Great Britain, Canada, and the United States we get £120,000 worth Clearly, there again we have to fear not the cheap pauper labour, but the highly-paid, intelligent labour of the world. That is the cause of our trouble, if trouble there he. We import about £212,000 worth of furniture per annum. I find from the <inline font-style="italic">Statistical Year-Book</inline> that as far back, as 1904 we had engaged in this industry in Australia 5,000 male hands, in addition to about 428 females. I presume that the number has since greatly increased; but for the purposes of our argument let us assume that there are only 5.000 male hands engaged in the industry to-day. I have just made some inquiries from a practical man in the chamber, who tells me that it is safe to say that the total market value of the furniture turned out in twelve months by a fair average furniture-maker is at least £500. That being so. and assuming that these 5.000 nien are fully employed, we are annually manufacturing furniture of the value of £2,500,000. That is really an under-estimate, for even in 1904 there were, as I have said, 5,000 males and 428 females, engaged in the industry. We import about £i worth for every £11 10s. worth of furniture that we make in Australia; in other words, our total importations to-day represents only about 8 per cent, or 9 per cent, of the value of the furniture that is locally made. Does that show that we cannot hold up our heads under the old duties? Does it show that the industry is strangled? On the contrary, it clearly and unmistakably indicates that we are able to-day to compete with the rest of the world - that the industry is flourishing, and that we do not need the imposition which the Treasurer, acting on the recommendation of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission, has seen fit to propose. I wonder why he  Chairman  of the Tariff Commission has not been able to  give us some of the information that I have just furnished to the Committee, and which any honorable member could: obtain by referring .to <inline font-style="italic">Coghlan.</inline> I fail to understand why we have been paying thousands of pounds to enable the Commission- to make investigations when, by reference to <inline font-style="italic">Coghlan,</inline> we can obtain better information than it furnishes. The honorable member for Bendigo must be playing with the Committee when he declines to give us any information except from one interested 'individual who says that he cannot carry on, and that if we do not put a stop to Chinese labour he will have to go under. The figures I have quoted show that it is the Chinaman in Australia and not the Chinaman abroad that is hurting us. Does the honorable member for Yarra expect me. as a self-respecting decent white man, to decline to take the furniture made by men of my own kith and kin in order to find work for Chinamen in Melbourne? Before he asks for these prohibitive duties he ought to tell us what he is going to do with the Chinese in the furniture trade in Australia. He is frank enough to tell us that the furniture industry here is in the hands of the Chinese, and yet he is clamouring for prohibitive duties in order to protect them against our own kith and kin at Home. </para>

                                <para>- So far as I am able to see, the white men in the furniture trade of South Australia are doing very well; I have not heard that their industry is being strangled. The industry in Sydney is not. Most of the large warehouses in Sydney are making their own furniture, and excellent it is. On visiting Anthony Hordern's warehouse, one finds that furniture equal to anything that the world can produce is being manufactured there. The figures I have quoted show that under the old duty of 20 per cent, furniture-makers in Australia have found no difficulty in competing with' imports from China, Japan, and the rest of the world. </para>

                                <para>- Our imports from the Straits Settlements last year were of the value of ,£1,100. Can we survive such an importation ? We are annually manufacturing furniture of the value of £2,5,00,000, and ,£1,100 worth is coming in from the Straits Settlements ! I wonder that the  Chairman  of the Tariff Commission did not sink to the earth when he heard of those figures. We ought at once to cease passing Tariff enactments under which ,£1,100 worth of furniture can be imported from the Straits Settlements ; we ought to pass a general prohibition Act, preventing anybody or anything from coming into Australia. . As to the 7s.  6d. chairs, I do not think that we need trouble about them. If I am any judge of the common-sense of the Committee,,, they are doomed, and I hope that we shall not waste time in debating that phase of the question. </para>

At any rate, I ' invite the Committee to consider well the broad facts of the situation. If there were any danger of our furniture makers going under, I should not object to the old duties being increased. But they have established themselves in the Commonwealth, and all the statistics I can find show that they are prospering, and need not fear outside competition. They are doing very well, and we ought not to increase the duties. </para>

                                <para>- We ought not to impose further duties, because when we have brought our industrial enterprises into a state of fair competition with outside industries we have done, even from a protectionist point of view, all that we ought to do. If we do more, we close the gates ; we prohibit importations of any kind, and assuredly in such cases our industries will not thrive. The. moment it begins to build walls to keep out the skill, efficiency, enterprise, and competition of the world, a nation begins to decay. That is the history of the world, and therefore those honorable members who talk about effective protection simply mean to level the conditions  of competition, and not to abolish competition altogether. </para>

                            <para>.- The honorable member for Parramatta has just told us that 5,000 males are engaged in the furniture trade of the Commonwealth, and he has chided the  Chairman  of the Tariff Commission for not putting before the Committee information gleaned in the course of its inquiries. The honorable member, however, instead of seeking ii&gt; formation . from the <inline font-style="italic">Minutes of Evidence</inline> taken by the Commission in 1906, has turned to <inline font-style="italic">Coghlan</inline> for 1904. Had he examined the reports of the Commission, he would have found that the employment of Europeans in the furniture trade of Australia is, not as he suggests,, increasing, but is decreasing, and that the Chinese are largely displacing the white man in the industry. </para>

In Victoria, I think the last returns show "that there were not more than 145 cabinetmakers working in the whole State . . whereas I am given to understand that the last returns available show that there were 672 Chinese working at furniture in Melbourne alone. </para>

                                <para>- We shall know what kind of a White Australian the honorable member for Parramatta is when we ask him to vote for an Excise duty on furniture made by aliens- in. Australia, with the object" of lessening the number of Chinese employed in the furniture trade. The witness from whom I have quoted dealt later on with the wages paid to Chinese in "Victoria, and he said -  " We have come to the conclusion, reckoning the cost of material and so forth, that the Chinese are not getting more on an average than ios. or 11s. per week in the furniture trade. We do not feel' disposed to come down to that standard of living, and therefore they can beat us every time. It is a matter of impossibility to compete against them." </para>

                        </continue>
                        <para class="block">At question 76223 the witness was asked -  " Can you say whether these Chinese furniture makers are as a rule properly-trained tradesmen?"  and his answer was -  "They are not. They used to come here imported in batches. About nine years ago one Chinaman who could not pay his creditors went away, and he agreed with eighteen Chinese to pay them 2s. 6d. per week and their rice. He went away without paying the half-crown a week. Those Chinese came out here, not as boys, but as grown-up men, and they were put on to clean up stuff. Chinese are very good copyists. They do not work from drawings or designs, but from the finished article in front of them." </para>
                        <para class="block">We often hear statements made about the States Parliaments introducing legislation to check the employment of Chinese in factories. In answer to question 76177 this witness admitted that the Chinese had an unlimited right to work at the furniture trade in Victoria, and I am in a position to say that they have the same right in New South Wales. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dobson</inline> is an expert in the furniture trade, and understands its conditions in all of the States. In another part of his evidence he made this startling statement in reference to Victoria -  " We should also be glad if some recommendation could be made in connexion with the Chinese difficulty. The Chinese, as I have explained, have got the furniture trade of Victoria in their own hands. In New South Wales they have it nearly in their own hands ; and in Western Australia, not only have they gone into the manufacturing part of the business, but they arc doing the retail trade as well. They have their warehouses, and they pocket the middleman's profits by selling to the public direct." </para>
                        <para>He states what, in his opinion, the ultimate outcome is likely to be, and he says -  " If the Chinese have come here to stay, and nothing can be done to stop them, all I can say is that the cabinet-making 'industry will go ultimately out of the hands of white workers. There is no question at all about that." </para>
                        <para>I admit the necessity for a duty on furniture to protect our white workers in the trade against the cheap labour of Germany, China, Japan, Java, and other places where furniture is manufactured very cheaply, and we can. apply the. new protection to protect the public. But it is just as necessary that we should do something to protect "the white workers in the trade in Australia from the unfair competition of Chinese within the Commonwealth. Coloured labour is as great an evil in the furniture industry as it was in the sugar industry, and we know that in the past this Parliament made special provision to meet the disabilities under which white workers in the sugar industry have to labour. I ask the Minister now to say whether he will not make some attempt to' deal with the Chinese in the furniture trade, and protect the white men engaged in that trade by means of an Excise provision such as that which has been applied to the sugar industry and to the agricultural implement trade. In dealing with the sugar industry this Parliament has already given effect to the principle that white workers must be protected against coloured labour in the cane-fields. It is not sufficient to protect the white nien employed in the furniture trade against the products of black labour outside of Australia. It  is absolutely imperative that we should do something to prevent white men from being expelled altogether from the furniture trade by the employment in Australia itself of coloured labour in the industry. The ' necessity for action in the matter is shown by the statement that in this trade there are 672 Chinese employed in Melbourne alone, as against 145 white men throughout Victoria. I ask the Treasurer now to say whether he will not make some statement on this matter? </para>

                                <para>- If there is a big evil in our midst we should take advantage of every opportunity afforded to us to deal with it. An opportunity is afforded now in dealing with the Tariff, and it is only at rare intervals that a Tariff is before Parliament. We can make some provision to protect white workers against the competition of Chinese in this industry in Australia. I say that the Treasurer should inform the Committee whether the protection to this industry for which he is asking is to be for the benefit of the white men or the coloured men engaged in the industry. If I did not believe that we might do something to secure the protection asked for bv these duties for the white workers in the furniture trade  I  should be prepared to vote free-trade on these items. If the Treasurer will not make a statement on the subject, and if he  is  not concerned- </para>

                                <para>- I am surprised to hear a Labour man say that. From, an intimate knowledge of men engaged in the furniture trade, and from associating with them iri the Trades Halls of Melbourne and Sydney, I say without fear of truthful contradiction that the white, men in the furniture trade do require protection against the local Chinese. Is it not well known that they have been seeking in vain to secure that protection by means of State legislation? They cannot get the protection they desire under State laws, and as we have the opportunity now to give it to them w« should do it. If we let this opportunity pass, we do not know when we shall have another opportunity to impose Excise duties on Chinese made furniture, which would give a real protection to the white men engaged in the industry. </para>

                            <para>.- I did not intend to speak on this matter, but as several supporters of the Government Gave made speeches so closely resembling a stone-wall of the Tariff, I may be pardoned for attempting to reply to some of the' statements that have been made, which are of such a nature that we cannot allow them to pass without criticism. The arguments, advanced by those of the Labour members who support these high duties, show that their only effect will be to give a greater monopoly of the work to the Chinese in Australia, particularly in Little Bourke-street and other parts of Melbourne. The original reason why the Chinese have outstripped the Europeans in the manufacture of furniture was the imposition of the high Victorian duties. Twenty-five years ago, when the Chinese came here, they were not expert cabinetmakers. They manufactured a low grade of common cedar chair. When the Victorian duty was imposed, the dealers, owing to the low price of the imported low grade chair, were forced to go to the' Chinese for their supplies, and under their tuition the Chinese gradually became more expert. At that time we had no Chinese cabinetmakers in Sydney, but as the Melbourne Chinese became experts, they crossed the border and entered into competition with the European cabinetmakers of Sydney. Consequently, we in New South Wales have had to bear the burden of this Chinese competition, resulting from the high Victorian duty in the .past. A return called for by the honorable member for Kooyong showed that in New South Wales in 1898 there were sixty-nine factories, and 1,075 adult males employed; while in 1900 there were seventy-seven factories, and J.333 adult males employed in cabinetmaking, &amp;c. In Victoria in 1898 there were fifty-six factories, and 808 adult male operatives; while in 1900 there were fifty-nine factories, . and 922 adult males employed. The following return shows the proportion of male and female adults and children employed, and the total number of operatives in each State: - </para>

                        <para class="block">These figures make it clear that under the lower New South Wales Tariff there were more factories, giving more employment, and making a better class of furniture, and that altogether the industry was much more flourishing than it was in Victoria under the higher protective Tariff. From evidence given by representatives of the Upholstery and Cabinetmakers' Unions of Sydney and Melbourne, it would appear that the competition of the Chinese was not felt very severely at that time, and that the wages in Sydney were higher than in Melbourne before the trade in the latter city was put under Wages Boards, and were somewhat higher even for some time afterwards.

                        <para class="block">This was all under the influence of the lower duty in New South Wales, where the wages paid' were higher than those paid in Melbourne, although the workers in the latter city were supposed to be getting the benefit of the higher protective duty, which was presumably imposed in the interests of the workers. The conditions in Melbourne before the minimum wage enactment was passed are shown by evidence given bv delegates of various trades at a conference held between the Trades' Hall Council and the Anti-Sweating League, as reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of nth June,  1900.  The wickerworkers' delegate stated that under the piece-work system boys were employed to do the work, one factory having fourteen men, twenty boys, and three improvers. The Chief Inspector of Factories of Victoria, in his annual report for  1897,  stated that adult furniture operatives earned an average of  31s.  id. per week at that time. A comparison of prices of most of the furniture is almost impossible, but it can be made regarding some lines. Kohn's Vienna chairs may be cited, the prices being those of Messrs. Anthony Hordern and Sons, of Sydney, and Messrs. Wallach Brothers, of Melbourne, before  8th  October,  1901.  For number  14  the. Sydney price was  4s. 9d.,  and the Melbourne price  5s. 6d.  for the same chair. For number  20  the Sydney price was  5s. -6d.,  and the Melbourne price  6s. 3d.  I have here a great deal of statistical information, as well as a number of invoices, which I might quote to the Committee, but I do not want to occupy too much time. I wish to be as brief as I can, consistently with giving the necessary reply to some of the arguments which have been advanced on the other side. At the present time some of the best furniture made in Melbourne is being made by Chinese workers. I went with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lonsdale,</inline> who formerly represented New England in this House, through one of the furniture factories of Melbourne. When we were admiring some magnificent specimens of cabinet work on exhibition, we were greatly surprised to learn that the furniture which we most admired, and thought to be high-class European manufacture, had been made by Chinese in this city, who were receiving wages higher than those paid here to Europeans. </para>

                                <para>- That statement is not borne out by facts which are easily obtained in this city. The honorable member is not in possession of the facts as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lonsdale</inline> and myself were. I am speaking from my own personal " observation of the work. The manufacturers said to us, " We do not mind telling you that this is all Chinese-made furniture, that we pay the highest, wages to Chinese, and get the best class of goods from them; but it would not do for us to tell that to our ordinary customers, because there would be a prejudice against the furniture on that account." I mention those facts to show that the effect of the high Victorian duty in the beginning was to encourage the' making of furniture by Chinese, and 10 establish them firmly in our midst, and that the only effect of the high duty now proposed will be to further entrench them in this trade, and give them a practical monopoly as against their white competitors in America, Canada, and Great Britain. In the light of those figures, I hope that honorable members who claim to represent labour interests will pause before they consent to the imposition of such a high duty, or anything approaching it, as is proposed in this Tariff. </para>

                            <para>.- I wish to reply briefly on one or two points. I believe there is a general understanding in the Committee as to what duties are to be agreed to. The honorable member for Angas, in referring to the great prosperity of the furniture factory at Edwardstown, South Australia, spoke as though its proprietors and manager did not desire increased duties. The honorable member argued that the previous duties had brought about such an era of prosperity that the firm required nothing further. But the evidence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mathias,</inline> the manager, given before the Tariff Commission, in Adelaide - and since repeated to me and a good many other honorable members personally - was that they could compete with the high-class goods imported, but complained that under the existing low Tariff the markets were flooded with cheap importations from foreign countries, where low wages were paid. This is the largest firm of furniture makers in Australia. Their manager added that they were not afraid of outside competition in high-class goods, such as bed-room suites, roll-top desks, &amp;c. ; but they could not compete against shoddy importations, such as overmantels and wire doors, closet seats, and similar articles. He mentioned that the firm were about to start the making of bentwood furniture from Tasmanian and Australian blackwood. Since that time they have put down the necessary plant, and have successfully experimented with the bending of Australian and Tasmanian blackwood for making bentwood chairs. The plant has now been put down, and work will be proceeded with as soon as the necessary operatives can be secured. The honorable member for Cook suggested that some special anti-Chinese legislation should be passed, but to any proposal of that kind I am strongly opposed. Ever since I have had a seat in Parliament I have protested against the introduction of Asiatics or any undesirable persons, but I have always taken the view that if these people are admitted into the country we ought to treat them as we treat other citizens. </para>

                            Our great objection to the Chinese is really that their work is cheaper than ours. I would point out, however, that" this problem has been solved in South Australia without the aid of any special legislation. In that State formerly, as in Victoria and elsewhere, the furniture trade was practically in the hands of the Chinese until the firms of A. Pengelly and Company, Edwardstown, and Marshall and Company, Adelaide, erected up-to-date machinery, and by this means drove the foreigners out of the business. There are more white men employed in the one factory at Edwardstown than, according to the honorable member for Cook, there are employed in the trade in the whole of Victoria. This is not a matter of protection against the outside world, but one of internal competition between whites and Chinese. New protection, wages boards, and so forth, which make for equal conditions for all, ought to be sufficient, in combination with up-to-date machinery, to enable white men to successfully compete against the Chinese workers.

Some of the lounges and chairs coming from these countries and invoiced at 5s. would take three days to make. </para>

In Western Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Baker,</inline> a furniture maker, voiced the complaints of the manufacturers as to the bitter competition caused by imports from the Straits Settlements, and as to extensive dumping on the part of the United States. Another wickerworker, named Jarvis, in Western Australia, complained that the price of wicker furniture in that State had decreased considerably during the last fifteen years, owing to the importation of inferior goods, while in some cases the cost of material had increased, and in other particular lines had decreased, during that time. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Baker</inline> further said that locally-made rattan lounges, which are of superior make, were sold wholesale at from 25s. upwards, while the imported article was retailed at 17s. 6d. ; and that chairs were sold at Singapore, f.o.b., at 4s. 6d., while similar chair's were marked in the shop windows at Adelaide at 11s. 6d., and had been sold at auction for 9s. 6d. That price, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Baker</inline> said, does not pay local manufacturers, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jarvis</inline> added that ordinary lounges could be produced locally at about 22s. 6d., while the imported article was sold at 10s. or 12s. It will be seen therefore, that it was not only the evidence of the three witnesses in Melbourne on which this fixed duty was based. </para>

I propose to ask the Committee to so amend these items as to confine them to wicker and bamboo chairs, leaving other chairs and lounges to come under the general duty of 40 per cent. In regard to importations, the Commission and myself have been accused of negligence in not giving consideration to that questions.

                            <para>. - When this item was reached, before the dinner-hour, the Treasurer led us to understand that its consideration would occupy only a few minutes. As a matter of fact, the discussion has continued for a considerable time; and it would be out of place on my part to prolong it further than to make a suggestion which I think may meet with approbation. If I am able to judge the feeling of the Committee, the duty is objectionable chiefly in its application to chairs; but I understand that the Treasurer will so arrange the items as to meet that objection - the duty of 7s. 6d. being abandoned. There seems to be a feeling that the general duty on furniture is rather high ; and I think that 'the discussion might be shortened if the Treasurer were to accept duties of 35 pet cent, and 25 per cent. </para>

                            <para>. - I wish to say a word or two in reply to the honorable member for Bendigo, who acted as  Chairman  of the Tariff Commission. I am glad that he quoted the figures which he did, because they furnish incontestable proof that higher duties are not needed to protect our furniture trade. The honorable member referred to wicker furniture. But I have learned from the Customs officers in attendance upon the Treasurer that last year the total importations of this class of furniture into the Commonwealth were valued at about £25,000. So that there has been a huge drop in the importations since the period to- which the honorable member referred. </para>

                                <para>- The increase in our importations of furniture has not been proportionate to our increase in population. Last year the total value of the importations of wickerwork furniture into the Commonwealth was less than ,£25,000. The honorable, member for Bendigo talked about our importations from Japan and China. I invite his attention to the fact that the furniture used in Australia represents more than  1^2,500,000  annually, and that our total importations from Japan and the Straits Settlements were valued at only £10,000. The Government proposal is so absurd as not to merit serious consideration. For every pound's worth of furniture imported from those countries we manufacture .£250 worth in Australia. Could any better proof be forthcoming that these, extraordinary duties are not required to protect the furniture industry from outside competition ? </para>

                                <para>- I think so. Wicker furniture will be dealt with under item 304. Under the circumstances, I am compelled to accept lower rates than I should have liked to see imposed. If I thought that by prolonging the debate I could attain my desire, I should have no hesitation whatever in consenting to the House being called together immediately after Christmas for the purpose of completing the consideration of the Tariff. I do not think it is right that we should sacrifice duties merely for the purpose of securing an adjournment before Christmas. But I do not know that I can do any better than agree to the rates upon which the Committee have evidently determined. Consequently, I intend to move that the amendment be amended bv adding after the words", ad val.," the' words "(General Tariff), 35 per cent. ; (United Kingdom), 25 per cent." </para>

He does just as he chooses, arid endeavours to unduly dominate honorable members. But he cannot dominate me. Under the circumstances, and simply with  a view to saving time, I think that we might accept his proposals. </para>

I understood the Treasurer and a number of honorable members to say that they were unable to differentiate between furniture intended for hospitals and. furniture intended for other institutions.

                        <para>How will the Customs officers know that any water-colour paintings are going to public institutions? Why should not the requisites of hospitals, which are intended for the needy, the destitute, and  the  sick, be allowed to come in on the same conditions as water-colour paintings and other articles for public institutions? There is every justification for this amendment, which T hope the Committee will adopt. Probably ' the Treasurer has the numbers at his back, but I point out that the excuse about being unable to differentiate between articles will not hold water. It is absolutely hollow, as he knows. </para>

                            <para>. - I hope that the Treasurer will not agree to the amendment. I intend to take the risk of being called unsympathetic if there is anything intended to be worked in that direction. I am prepared to allow my actions outside the House to show whether I am unsympathetic in the way which has been hinted at. No doubt this is a very good free-trade idea to get in the thin end of the wedge. The public of Australia contribute to the maintenance of the hospitals, and the patients have no greater desire to rest their bodies on imported furniture than have other people. I think that the hospitals might as well use  the furniture which is made here, and therefore I hope that the Treasurer will not give way. </para>

That kind of furniture has not yet been dealt with. It is totally different from all other descriptions ot furniture. It is specially manufactured for hospitals. </para>

                            <para>.- I  wish to explain that this foot-note was introduced in order to secure  a  statutory definition of the term " superficial feet." It appears that in the various States, there was a conflict of definition. 'The Customs authorities investigated the matter, but were unable to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion. The Tariff Commission were asked to remove doubts by introducing  a  statutory definition, and we accepted one which was given to us in Queensland, and which was supported by a certain measure of authority.  I  was never very "sweet" on this definition. I have always thought that a superficial foot should mean an area of one square foot-on one square surface, and not less than 1 inch thick. I could never see the justice of charging as an inch that which was under an inch; but some of my colleagues thought that that was the true definition, and for the sake of having the point discussed by Parliament, I signed  a  report embodying that definition. Parliament is now afforded an opportunity to deal with the question. I .shall not regret the omission of the definition. I think it will remove a considerable cause of complaint and irritation, especially in connexion with dressed timber dutiable at 3s. per 100 superficial feet. </para>

                            <para>.- This question has been discussed a good deal in connexion with the old Tariff. "Undoubtedly, a number of timber workers have claimed that the real intention of the old Tariff was that whatever the thickness of a board might be, it should be charged duty as if it were an inch thick. It was contended, in various States, that if a board were a quarter of an inch thick, it should be treated as if it were an inch thick. </para>

                                <para>- That is so; but the Crown Solicitor advised the Department that under the old Tariff, it had no authority to do. so. The idea of the Government in putting the asterisk in this line was to give them legal authority to charge for1 inch, whatever the thickness of the plank. I think that the Treasurer might very well have stated the real reason why he desired to omit this definition. </para>

                                <para>- There exists a difference of opinion as to how the duty should be charged. If this authority is not inserted, it means that if planks are1/8-in. thick eight of them will come in as1-inch timber. What the Committee want to keep clearly in mind is, that if they omit the asterisk with the accompanying footnote, we shall simply be declaring that everything will be charged up to the inch. If sixteen planks go to make an inch, then sixteen thicknesses will be charged as1-inch timber. </para>

                                <para>- That is what it really means. A great deal of evidence was given before the Royal Commission. The Treasurer might very well explain the far-reaching consequences of the amendment which he has moved. Some people thought that authority existed under the old Tariff to charge as the Customs have been charging during the time of the temporary collection of duties under the new Tariff. The Attorney-General and the Crown Law officers always advised that no power to charge in that way existed under the old Act. </para>

                            <para>In the timber trade " superficial foot " means timber measuring 12 inches long by 12 inches wide by 1 inch thick. A piece of timber measuring 12 x 12 x1/2 measures in the trade half a superficial foot. In other words, the timber trade, in selling timber by the superficial foot, measures it on its actual thickness. The provision in the Tariff as recommended by the Commission, however, directs that when timber has a thickness of less than 1 inch, the thickness shall be taken as 1 inch for purposes of duty. </para>
                            <para>E.G.- A piece of timber measuring 12 x 12 x1/2, which in the trade is sold as half a superficial foot, is regarded for purposes of duty as being 1 superficial foot. If it is desired to revert to the practice under the old Tariff (which was the same as the trade practice mentioned), it is only necessary to strike out the asterisks wherever they appear against " super foot," and delete the footnote. </para>

                                <para>- I shall raise no objection to the addition of yellow pine and other varieties, but, for the moment, I am confining myself to  Oregon  and New Zealand pine. The reason why I move that these timbers be admitted free in these sizes is because they are timbers which are used very extensively in the Broken Hill mines. I will confine myself to the case as it affects those mines, leaving other honorable members to speak on behalf of their constituencies. It is absolutely necessary for the safety of the mines at Broken Hill that a large amount of  Oregon  timber should be used. In the first place, it is used on account of its lightness ; secondly, on account of its cost ; and also because we are informed by the mine managers and by the men who work in the mines that Oregon timber gives notice by creaking when some portions of the mines are, as they say, " coming together." </para>

                                <para>- It is, and consequently it is very advantageous to use it in some portions of the mines. But the great advantage, apart from that, is that it does not snap off suddenly, as hardwood  does,  but gives the men notice by creaking. To use a term that is employed at the Hill, " it talks,'-' and the men in the stopes have ample notice before a collapse takes place. </para>

                                <para>- In the  first  place, it is too costly a timber, and, in the second place, it does not offer the advantage that I have referred to in the case of  Oregon.  I  will  give a few figures as to the added cost that this duty means to the mines at Broken Hill. As far as the Broken Hill Proprietary Mine is concerned, the duty will mean an increase of ,£4,000 a year. Under the old Tariff £[2,000 per annum was paid. The new duty would mean an added cost of ,£4,000, making the total duty ,£6,000 in that mine alone. In the Broken Hill South Mine the duty would mean an added cost of ,£1,653; U1 Broken Hill Block 10 an increase of £[846 ; in the British Broken Hill an increase of £620; in Broken Hill Block 14, .£300; in junction North, .£320; in. South Blocks, <inline font-style="italic">£245;</inline> to the Sulphide Corporation, ,£2,687 J m North Broken Hill, ,£2,200. That means a total of ,£12,871 in added cost for the mines which I have mentioned. Then there are a number of smaller mines, whose expenses in connexion with timber have been increased by the duties by, say, £[3,000, making the extra taxation of the Broken Hill mining industry in respect of timber duties alone, over ,£15,000. Besides  Oregon,  a great deal of stringy bark is used in the mines, over 500,000 superficial feet being needed in a year for lining. A small quantity of South Australian timber is used, but its use is limited because of its weight, and the consequent cost of freight and handling. </para>

                                <para>- Yes. In connexion with the big wide lodes which occur at Broken Hill - some of them 300 feet wide - square sets of timber have to be used. Some of the mines which I have mentioned pay handsome dividends, and perhaps could afford to contribute more largely to the revenue; but it must be remembered that the extra duties will have to be paid by all mines, both those which are being worked at a profit, and those which are not. </para>

                                <para>- I think the strongest point which I have made is that oregon timber is required to insure the safety of the men working in the mines. Some of the Broken Hill mines are not very profitable at the present time. Only recently it was stated that the Junction mine, which has been employing a good many men, is likely to be closed down, except for some exploration work. No doubt, the main reason for closing that mine is the fall in the 'price of lead, but another reason' is the fact that it is now more costly to carry on mining operations than it was before the new Tariff was imposed. Whatever our fiscal faith may be, we must acknowledge that duties when first imposed make commodities dearer. No industry has been more heavily penalized by the Tariff than the mining industry, which has had to carry the baby all along. Nothing has been done for the benefit of that industry. </para>

                                <para>- If the honorable Member was importing machinery, he would not say that to pay £30 or £35 on every £100 worth was nothing. The machinery duties were imposed to benefit, not the mining industry, but the engineering trade. I do not say that -our engineers and artizans should not receive assistance ; but I feel bound to point out that this Parliament has done, and can do nothing, directly for the benefit of the miner, although, to assist other people, he is being taxed on everything he uses. I trust that an unduly heavy tax will not be placed on the timber that is necessary for the safety of mining operations. Not only do the miners desire to obtain undressed timber free, but, according to a paper which I have received from the Melbourne Timber Merchants' Association and the Federated Saw-mills Employes' Association, the employers and employes connected with the timber trade ask that oregon timber, 12 x 7, and larger sizes, be admitted duty free. </para>

                                <para>- I do not desire that the rich companies shall escape their fair share of taxation, but if a duty is imposed on undressed timber, a still higher duty will be imposed on dressed timber. The cheaper the production of ore, the more the employment that will be given. It is better to have a dozen mines working than to have only two or three, because, when there is a great demand for men, wages are higher than when men have to run after the mining managers to get employment. I. ask, too, that New Zealand pine for the manufacture of butter boxes be admitted duty free, though I shall leave it to other honorable members to speak at length on this subject. In the last Parliament we did not act fairly in allowing New Zealand pine to come in free and taxing oregon for mining purposes. The butter export trade is a big one which we all would like to see grow, and those connected with the butter industry should be able to get the best and most suitable timber for making butter boxes. But, at the same time, an industry which employs a great many more persons, pays better wages, and has a much more valuable export trade, should be allowed to get its raw materials as cheaply as possible. However, if I were to speak for a considerable time I should probably not alter a vote, and, therefore, having put my case before the Committee, I hope that honorable members will allow this timber to come in free. </para>

                            <para>. - I suggest that this would be a convenient time to report progress. We have had two long nights and three long days this week. I venture to say that if the honorable member permitted us to get a good night's sleep, it would tend to facilitate, rather than to retard business. I promise him that he will not lose anything by acceding to my request. We all recognise the necessity of pushing on with the Tariff, and it will tend to facilitate business if we adjourn to-night at a reasonably early hour. </para>
