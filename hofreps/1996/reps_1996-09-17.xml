<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Acting Prime Minister. Has the Acting Prime Minister's attention been drawn to comments today by Westpac's chief economist Bill Evans that unemployment may rise to nine per cent by the end of the year and they are forecasting 8&frac34; per cent? Is it also not the case that we now have the forecasters for Westpac and the government's own Treasury advisers last night at Senate estimates saying that neither the budget nor the government's industrial relations policy will have any favourable impact on employment? When will this government change strategy to give priority to jobs for Australians?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DG4">Mr TIM FISCHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have had my attention drawn to a related matter. Today the ACCI and Westpac released the September quarter survey of manufacturers. It reported that a survey of industrial trends, the first national survey entirely conducted after the bringing down of the 1996 budget, shows a marked rise in business expectations for the next six months. To quote Mark Paterson, `Business confidence is higher than at any time during last year.' Manufacturers, again, predicted increased new orders and output for the December quarter. The outlook for profits is positive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, it follows that the upswing in confidence and upswing in profits will engender more jobs as part of that process. I note <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> further that a net balance of 16 per cent of respondents expected an upturn in new orders in the coming quarter.</PARA>

If you look at that you will see that that is a doubling of respondents saying that they expect an upturn in new orders in the coming quarter. In other words, there are parts that you have selectively quoted. I simply say that the government's budget settings will put the right framework in place to create jobs.

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KK6">Mr McDOUGALL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Given the recent easing of the interest rate burden on Australian families and small business, can the Treasurer advise the House what the implications would be for continued low interest rates if the government's savings measures were blocked by the Senate? What would be the effect on average Australian families and battling small business if this was to occur?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australians are already experiencing a down payment on this government's good fiscal management. Financial markets responded positively to my announcement on 12 March of fiscal tightening. The sentiment was confirmed when the budget was delivered. Variable rate housing loans from banks have fallen from 10.5 per cent at the end of May to 9.25 per cent at the end of August&mdash;a money in the bank delivery to home buyers in Australia, a drop in rates from 10.5 per cent at the end of May to 9.25 per cent at the end of August.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the same period variable rate mortgage managers have seen rates go down from <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 8.9 per cent to 8.5 per cent. Indicator rates for variable loans to small business fell by 0.5 of a percentage point during August. The indicator rate for three&hyphen;year fixed small business loans has fallen from 10.1 per cent at the end of May to 9.1 per cent at the end of August. This is a government that by confronting the big issues of the Australian economy has been able to direct benefits to Australian small businesses and to Australian home buyers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You just heard the Acting Prime Minister indicate the strength of the ACCI&hyphen;Westpac report showing that net respondents&mdash;that is, those going one way over those going the other way&mdash;are expecting an improvement in business conditions in the next six months. A net balance of 16 per cent of respondents expect an upturn in new orders in the coming quarter&mdash;up from eight per cent in the previous quarter. A net balance of seven per cent predict increased output in the December quarter. The net balance of respondents planning to increase spending on plant and equipment in the next 12 months was up eight per cent. A net balance of 28 per cent of respondents expect higher profits in the next 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we hear the opposition talking about unemployment, we remember those years when the Labor Party ran unemployment in double figures. Now there is the fantastic notion coming from the Labor Party that if only we increased our deficits and debt that would make a difference. The Labor Party left an unemployment rate of 8&half; per cent plus after running up $70 billion of cumulated deficits. If cumulating deficits could have solved unemployment you would have been the champions, but you still had unemployment over eight per cent, coming off double figures, on $70 billion of deficit. That is a record of failure, but this is an opposition that has not learned. It is still persisting with the fantastic notion that running up further debt would make inroads in relation to unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The way to deal with unemployment in this country and deal with it permanently is to set Australia on a path for sustainable growth, to set a path for low interest rates, to set a path for business confidence, to set a path for a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4396"> flexible labour market and to deal with all of those structural impediments that Labor was unable to deal with.

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>

Your point of order was about as comprehensible as your deputy's questions. And now he turns around. Turn back! Listen to this! He always turns around at this point. We used to do that when we were in opposition. We turned around when we knew the bucket was coming. We know all of these tricks. You learnt them from us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can turn around on this one because I am announcing that today we have released the terms of reference for the Productivity Commission inquiry into private health insurance. The terms of reference have been <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4397"> framed following close consultations between me, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Family Services. The inquiry will be undertaken by Executive Commissioner Gary Banks, Commissioner Helen Owens and Dr Brendan Kearney, who will be appointed as a part-time associate commissioner for the purpose of the inquiry. Dr Kearney comes with a considerable wealth of experience to assist with this inquiry. He has been the chief executive officer of the Royal Adelaide Hospital and director of the Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science for over 10 years. He has had a long and distinguished career.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The inquiry will cover the structure and conduct of the industry and seek to contribute to efficiency and competitiveness. The private health insurance industry is a significant part of Australia's health system and this inquiry will make an invaluable contribution, providing a comprehensive picture of the industry and the regulatory environment under which it operates. It will be conducted against the background of the government's commitment to retain Medicare, bulkbilling and community rating and to encourage individuals and families to take out private health insurance through financial incentives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In order to avoid unnecessary bureaucratic duplication, I have requested the Productivity Commission undertake the legislation review for the Health Insurance Act 1973, part 3, and the National Health Act 1953, part 6 and schedule 1, as part of the inquiry, which had previously been scheduled for 1997-98.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We encourage all interested parties to make submissions&mdash;even the ACTU, which has put a ban and a boycott on the Productivity Commission of recent times, I noticed. They will be welcome to remove their ban and boycott and put any submissions that they might wish to do. The report will be presented to the government by February of next year, and the Productivity Commission will be releasing an issues paper shortly.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Acting Prime Minister and Minister for Trade. Is it not a fact that many major multi <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> national companies have been encouraged to set up their regional headquarters in Australia as a result of government encouragement and promotion? Is he aware that the former government's regional headquarters program, which this government gutted in the budget, encouraged 92 new regional headquarters to be set up in Australia since 1993, attracting an estimated $2 billion in investment and at least 9,000 jobs? In the light of this, I ask him whether he endorses the Prime Minister's comments in Jakarta:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Neither do I see Australia as a bridge between Asia and the West as is sometimes suggested.</PARA>
<PARA>I ask the Acting Prime Minister and Minister for Trade whether he is similarly willing to dismiss, with a wave of the hand, a central role for Australia in the growing inter&hyphen;bloc trade between Asia and the West, a role that can clearly create and already has created thousands of jobs for Australians?</PARA></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="4397" SPEAKER="Fischer, Tim, MP" NAMEID="DG4" ELECTORATE="Farrer" PARTY="NP" MINISTERIAL="Trade; Deputy Prime Minister" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DG4">Mr TIM FISCHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his timely question. I express a regret that the poor old shadow minister for trade gets squeezed out by these big bullies down the centre, as does the shadow minister for tourism. There is one dead hole seat in this House and I know where it is: it is on that end of the front bench under the lee of the press gallery, out of sight and out of mind. Why won't they give you a go, Stephen?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very happy whenever ministers of the Australian coalition government go abroad. When the Prime Minister goes abroad he goes to represent Australia's interests, first and foremost, not Asia's interests in Europe, not Europe's interests in Asia, but Australia's interests. It is in that context that I support the Prime Minister's comments that Australia cannot be a bridge to Asia in a cultural or political sense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But in relation to the economic linkages, business operations and trade and investment, it is absolute that we want to maximise the connection in every direction. We will do that as a consequence of a range of decisions we have already taken. I happily confirm the policy partly alluded to by the Leader of the Opposition but released under `Meeting the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4398"> challenges', the Liberal and National Party trade strategies for the future, which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will promote Australia to the European Union and to the United Kingdom, in particular, as a bridge to the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region and, therefore, as a solid base for EU trade and investment, separate from a cultural bridge. Especially, we intend to enhance Australia's attractiveness as a financial centre and as a base for the location of regional headquarters in the Asia&hyphen;Pacific.</PARA>
<PARA>So there is no difference between the thrust of your question and the policy of the previous government&mdash;but one, perhaps, and I will come back to that&mdash;and the policy of this government. Indeed, it was when the Minister for Finance was Premier of New South Wales that a great deal of progress was made with regard to the Cathay Pacific headquarters in Sydney, a very good example of that type of important economic development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to point out to members of the opposition that there is one area of practice in which we differ in respect of visits to Asia by Prime Ministers. You might remember that Prime Minister Keating was on Indonesian soil when he sought to rewrite the constitution and redesign our flag. Our Prime Minister will never, ever do that.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HQ5">Mr FAHEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. Members may have seen recent press reports about the results of Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. I remind honourable members Commonwealth Serum Laboratories was the first Labor government asset sale to proceed by way of public share offer. That occurred in May 1994 and the Labor government at the time received some $292 million for the sale of Commonwealth Serum Laboratories.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The company has recently announced its results. It showed an 18 per cent lift in profits to $24.5 million on sales of $290 million. Those sales were up some 13.5 per cent in the year to June. In the two years since the float <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the share price has more than doubled&mdash;from $2.30 at the time of issue to $6 today. This was the privatisation that the former Minister for Finance and now Leader of the Opposition had in mind when he spoke to the Press Club on 24 August 1994 on the merits of privatisation. Let me remind the House of some of the things that the Leader of the Opposition said at that time. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The primary objective driving the privatisation program is to make Australia an efficient, internationally competitive economy.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Acting Speaker, we agree. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The focus of debate on efficiency measures such as privatisation and competition policy is often on job losses but it is more important to realise the efficiency gained from the pursuit of competition creates jobs.</PARA>
<PARA>We agree. He said:.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Privatisation fits in with the government's broader imperative to create jobs.</PARA>
<PARA>We agree. So does the commentator Stephen Bartholemeusz, who recently said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>  when commenting on the CSL results:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CSL's experience would appear to be the clearest demonstration of the benefit of the privatisation effects of moving a government&hyphen;owned business operating in commercial markets into private ownership. In 1994 at the point of privatisation it had international revenue that represented 12 per cent of its revenue base. Today 27 per cent of its revenue comes from offshore activity. That kind of expansion was impossible for a publicly owned CSL, not just because of capital constraints but because the political risk reward equation was so biased against it.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>Stephen Bartholomeusz went on to say that this is exactly the equation that Telstra faces. I believe that the Leader of the Opposition had Telstra in mind back in August 1994 when he addressed the press club and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The "net gain"&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>of privatisation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">can take many forms: potentially better services and lower prices for consumers; stronger enterprises and greater competition for our economy; and in the broader sense, making government funds available for new policy.</PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly what the government wants to do. It wants to ensure that the most significant environmental program in this nation's history gets the $1 billion for the trust fund out of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4399"> partial sale of Telstra to proceed with those new policies&mdash;that is, new policy that is in the interests of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am surprised because only this morning the Leader of the Opposition, commenting on a particular debate in the other chamber yesterday and a vote expressed by Senator Harradine, said, `The road to privatisation is a hard one for us to bite on.' It wasn't hard to bite on back in the National Press Club in August 1994 when he made it abundantly clear that it was in the interest of Australia to ensure that there were those businesses that governments should not be in, that they should be out there. Telstra was in the Leader of the Opposition's mind at that stage. Sadly, he now goes down to political expediency for narrow, short&hyphen;term, political gain. He has no credibility on the subject of privatisation.</PARA>

I draw the minister's attention to the large number of unemployed people, particularly long&hyphen;term unemployed people, in my electorate of Robertson and throughout Australia who cannot find jobs because of Labor's policy failures. What action is the government taking to get rid of this legacy from Labor and to help unemployed people obtain work?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="4400" SPEAKER="Kemp, Dr David, MP" NAMEID="BT4" ELECTORATE="Goldstein" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Schools, Vocational Education and Training" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BT4">Dr KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Robertson for his question. The fact that trend unemployment has been stalled now for some time at 8.6 per cent is one of the most tragic legacies of the Labor government. Today's figures, which show a rise in seasonally adjusted long-term unemployment by 13,000 and in trend unemployment by 3,000, are now revealing the full dimension of Labor's legacy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party claimed that it was going to help the long-term unemployed. The facts in the Working Nation evaluation statement are very, very different. The share of labour market assistance for the long-term unemployed actually fell during the Working Nation period. There was an eight per cent reduction in job referrals for the long-term unemployed under Working Nation. There was a three per cent fall in their share of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> jobstart placements. There was no change overall in their share of training program placements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Working Nation program was very good, however, at one thing; that is, redefining the long-term unemployed as short-term unemployed. Of course, the member for Hotham has said that he totally rejects that interpretation of Working Nation. He says that it did not have that effect. Once again, the facts are very different. I would like to quote the Working Nation evaluation statement about the impact of redefinition. The evaluation concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This leaves the Job Compact open to charges of `recycling' clients from long-term to short-term unemployment, rather than substantively improving their labour market prospects.</PARA>
<PARA>These are not our words; they are the objective conclusion of an evaluation process established by the member for Hotham himself. If he was less busy evaluating his prospects for the deputy leadership, he would be able to face up to the truth. As the merry-go-round slows, we are now seeing in today's figures the full scale of the problem that you have left behind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government, by contrast with the Labor Party, takes its obligations to the long-term unemployed seriously and does not treat them just as pawns to advance the minister's career in the short term. We will be enlisting the resources of the private sector job placement agencies who will be contracted to make connections between long-term unemployed people and real jobs. We will be putting a major emphasis on incentives for job placement agencies to achieve a full employment outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4401"> Over the next four years this government will be spending $5.4 billion on assistance to unemployed people. It is true that we are not maintaining the massive wasteful expenditures that came out of the pockets of Australia's families during the locust years of Paul Keating&mdash;the locust years when he was piling up that $70 billion of deficits which you were too weak to prevent and which did not offer any effective assistance to unemployed people.

In that plan on page 35, it highlights the number of redundancies or job losses that would be taking place at AN. Indeed, I have to admit that I did somewhat misinform the House last week when I said that it was some 950 jobs that would be going under Labor's secret plan for AN. I was wrong. The actual number of jobs in the corporate plan, as approved by the former Minister for Transport, the member for Kingsford-Smith, was 972. In case the Leader of the Opposition thinks that this gets him off the hook, I would also point out to the House that the Leader of the Opposition, then Minister for Finance, in discussion with the Minister for Transport on the very same corporate plan in a letter that he wrote to the Minister for Transport on 18 September said, in relation to the corporate plan:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I asked in the House last week: did the then Minister for Transport and the then Prime Minister, when they visited AN's workshops at Islington, inform those workers of what they were proposing to do, what they had secretly signed off in this corporate plan? Of course they did not. Indeed, what we now know is that the Labor Party, when in government, had a plan not only to take away 972 jobs from AN but also, of course, as part of that plan, as we have seen reports of, that various aspects of AN would be advertised for sale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, indeed, I take up the challenge put by the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith in his personal explanation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government obviously takes the subject of paedophilia and child abuse very seriously. As the member's question really sets out, the subject is under review on a number of different fronts. It needs to be borne in mind in the first place that offences against children committed within Australia are basically the responsibility of the states and territories. That is not to say that the Commonwealth should not show leadership in relation to any attempt to prevent or uncover those offences. We do, and we will continue to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth has primary responsibility under the child sex tourism legislation that was brought down in 1994-95 in respect of travel from Australia by persons intent on <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> committing offences against children in other countries. Since that legislation has been brought in, there have been charges laid and there has been one conviction under that legislation. There are other investigations under way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member specifically mentioned the Commonwealth Law Enforcement Board. The Commonwealth Law Enforcement Board has the responsibility of coordinating the law enforcement activities of agencies within my portfolio. They have a limited role, although, through bodies like the Australasian Police Ministers Council, they have a role in coordination and, as I mentioned earlier, leadership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She has also specifically mentioned the Wood commission. The Wood commission is a commission into the New South Wales police primarily, although the government has extended its terms of references to deal with paedophilia. It has not yet completed its work in relation to paedophilia. When it has, the government will coordinate any activities necessary between New South Wales and the Commonwealth at the appropriate level and in the appropriate way. We are in close contact with Mr Justice Wood and counsel assisting him in his work, and will continue to be so.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To assist the ABC in this task, the government set up the Mansfield review to establish clear priorities for the ABC. Within the review's terms of reference, the government spelt out priority areas which it expects the review to consider. These are: independent news and current affairs services which are accurate, impartial and comprehensive; high quality information and entertainment services which contribute to a sense of national identity; and services which fulfil the needs of rural and remote communities, children and other significant groups not well served by other broadcasting services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the rugby league coverage, listeners of the ABC regional radio in rural New South Wales and Queensland would clearly suffer if such broadcasts were discontinued.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4407">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members will recall that when in opposition the coalition had a policy of a more equitable distribution of the noise caused by aircraft over Sydney.

You will also recall that we had a policy of trying to direct more flights over water or non&hyphen;residential areas in order to try to minimise the total aircraft noise problem in Sydney. To that extent, we have announced a number of initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government reopened the east-west runway within 10 working days of being sworn into office; in fact, it was within eight. On 15 June we announced another initiative which was designed to put more aircraft into Sydney and out of Sydney over water. Then, just recently, we received a report from Airservices Australia, recommending that the new third runway have aircraft taking off to the north and making an immediate right-hand turn and joining the east-west runway flight paths. This is an initiative that we asked Airservices to look at some months ago.</PARA>

That was because of your mismanagement of Sydney's Mascot airport and the enormous angst you created whilst you were in government. This government has inherited that problem, and we are now resolving it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decision to allow take-offs to the north on the new third runway was announced yesterday, and it will considerably relieve those people living to the north of the runway from aircraft noise. What it will effectively mean is that about half of the total number of take-offs to the north will now be able to occur on the new third runway, making that immediate right-hand turn.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The beneficiaries of this are, in particular, those people living in the Labor strongholds of Grayndler and Sydney. Those are the Labor seats to which you could have provided substantial reduction in aircraft noise had you been bothered to take up this initiative. Indeed, your failure to take up that initiative <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is a betrayal of those people who live in suburbs like Petersham and Sydenham and Leichhardt and Marrickville and Drummoyne&mdash;all of them in those Labor areas.

That was the first of the announcements yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second and a very important announcement yesterday about Sydney's airport to reduce the noise is that we will now be operating aircraft in the early hours of the morning over the water rather than over suburbs. This again will provide considerable relief for people living to the north of the airport in seats like Grayndler and Sydney, right up to seats around Pymble.

<TIME.STAMP>(3.17 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are several thousand workers&mdash;mostly in South Australia in areas like Adelaide and Port Augusta and, to a lesser extent, in Tasmania&mdash;who are very fearful for their jobs and have been so for several months. Sadly, their fate is in the hands of a minister who appears not to care about their future, who wants to take the decisions about their future in secret and who wants to deny them the opportunity to participate in debate about the report which appears to be establishing that sad future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will run through the essence of what has occurred with respect to Australian National in the past few months. The Minister for Transport and Regional Development, the member for Hume (Mr Sharp), received the report on time on 19 June, as requested. He has been to cabinet at least twice on the issue. He has even established the partly backbench committee with people like the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) and the member for Grey (Mr Wakelin) on the committee. The committee does not appear to have done anything as yet. He has refused to release the report, in spite of the fact that workers in Australian National are understandably worried about their future and worried about their jobs, and he has refused to give any indication of its recommendations or its findings. Finally, after three months, when he is forced to release the report via the Senate by Labor <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4411"> in the Senate, all we get is the executive summary&mdash;and a doctored executive summary at that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of the excuse of commercial in confidence, the minister says, `Sorry, we can't give you the full report. We can't give you the data on which the analysis is based. We can't give you the evidence that sustains the analysis of the financial situation of Australian National. All we can give you is the executive summary, but that itself has also got to be changed in order to protect commercial in confidence.' That excuse is probably half valid in one or two examples but, when you actually go through the report and the undoctored version&mdash;which we also happen to have obtained&mdash;you will see that there are several instances where commercial confidentiality has got nothing to do with the doctoring, and that politics has got everything to do with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, a statement in the original version saying `The recent decision to abolish the corporate office of Australian National' does not appear in the version tabled in the Senate. Equally, a recommendation that the Tasmanian government should be subsidised to take over AN operations in Tasmania, but only if it meets competition policy criteria in the competition policy agreement, is also deleted. We might well ask what is in the full report if such perversions have occurred with respect to even the executive summary?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Commercial in confidence is simply a fig leaf for the minister to try to hide the real debate, the real reasons and the real issues that hang over the heads of the workers in Australian National. But that slipping and sliding, that ducking and weaving, is nothing compared with the events that have occurred since the release of the report. First we had the minister say in the tabling statement that was tabled in the Senate by Senator Tambling, `Oh, we haven't made any decisions yet. Don't panic, don't worry, this report is a report to the government. It is not a report of the government. We haven't made any decisions. We are considering all options.' I will quote Senator Tambling's statement to make this very explicit. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, it is only one of several sources of information being considered, and it is not necessa <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> rily indicative of the decisions the Government will take. The perception, which seems to be widely held, that the Report will be implemented, cannot be sustained at present. What elements of the report are to be implemented, if any, is yet to be decided.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No&hyphen;one should assume the Government will be implementing this report in making decisions about their future.</PARA>
<PARA>Pretty unequivocal and pretty explicit stuff: `Do not worry, people working at AN. Do not worry, families of workers at places like Port Augusta and Islington. Do not worry because we are not necessarily going to do any of these things.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his statements to the House in answer to a question on 11 September&mdash;last Wednesday&mdash;the minister said, `No, don't worry. We're not necessarily going to do any of these things. No decisions have yet been made.' And, predictably enough, all of this is the former government's fault. I will give a couple of quotes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The previous Labor government and its ministers ignored all those warnings. What did they do about it? They just sat by and watched.</PARA>
<PARA>Remember that: they just sat by and watched. Then things got a bit interesting. The following day we came across a press release from Australian National and a draft advertisement that was apparently due to appear in the newspapers. To the best of our knowledge it has not yet appeared, but presumably it will.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That advertisement specified that Australian National was going to sell off four of its eight key businesses, including its workshops at Port Augusta and Islington, its infrastructure services division, and its wagon and loco maintenance and services divisions, but not&mdash;I emphasise not&mdash;any rail track or any of the rail corridor. There was a familiar ring about this press release and a familiar ring about the content of the advertisement. They set a few bells ringing. When we referred back to the content of the Brew report executive summary that we got the day before, it was a dead ringer. It was a remarkable coincidence&mdash;extraordinary. The advertisement and the content of the press release were all smack on&mdash;all dead on. Exactly the sorts of things that have been recommended by Mr Brew in his recommendations to the minister. An extraordinary coincidence.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4412">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In question time that day, not surprisingly, the minister was asked by the member for Adelaide&mdash;no doubt at his instigation&mdash;`Why is it that these things are occurring if the government is making no decisions?' If the government has no preconceptions about what it is going to do with respect to the Australian National situation, why is it that, literally within hours of the Brew inquiry report being tabled in the Senate, a press release came out from Australian National containing almost all of the Brew package, all of the key components, all of the really nasty bits. It was there in black and white. It said, `Yes, we are seeking expressions of interest from the private sector about selling off all of these businesses', and, `Yes, that probably means lots of workers losing their jobs.' Why was this happening? The minister's response was, `Oh, but this is all Labor's fault'&mdash;the same Labor that was not doing anything. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These reports about the possible sale of AN's assets and of major job losses at AN emanate from the fact that these sales and these job losses were planned in the business plan of the previous Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA>We have heard some more about all of that today. We were told that it was nothing to do with the minister, that there are no nasty decisions on his hands. He is not going to be slashing anybody's jobs. He is just an innocent bystander in this situation. He is just there watching; he is looking back more in sorrow than in anger saying, `Isn't it all a pity that this is happening to Australian National. But it is nothing to do with me; I am not making any decisions. Don't worry.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two things that can be said about this. The first is the obvious point that the minister's line on 12 September totally contradicted his line on 11 September that Labor had done nothing. On the first day, he was telling us, `No, Labor ignored all these things, it did not do anything.' On the second day he was telling us `Jobs are being slashed by Labor.' The second and more fundamental point is that this statement was patently untrue. On Wednesday, 11 September he told us, `Labor had ignored all the warnings. Labor had sat by and watched. Labor was asleep at the wheel.' But on Thursday, 12 September, he told us that all the sell&hyphen;offs that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> were going to occur, that were put in train at the same time as the Brew report was handed down, were all planned by the previous Labor government in its business plan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous Labor government would have to have been the most remarkable government in history. Not only did it tackle these problems when they came up, but it actually came up with a response that was so clairvoyant that it exactly matched the results of an inquiry that was set in train after it lost office. What an extraordinary performance! What an amazing performance! It is very nice of you to impute such clairvoyance to the previous government; it is not something that we are used to from your side. But it does test your credibility just a fraction. Which is it? Was Labor sitting and doing nothing? Or did it initiate these proposals that you are now trying to wash your hands of? Did it initiate the job losses that you now claim you have nothing to do with? Both cannot apply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately for the minister, the following day was Friday the 13th, which was a bit of an unlucky day for him. A letter came into the possession of the opposition which threw a bit of light on this. The real truth about what had been going on started to emerge. The person who instructed Australian National to do these things, the person who was making the decision to ensure that substantial numbers of workers&mdash;hundreds, possibly thousands of workers&mdash;would lose their jobs, the person who had initiated the decision to let loose four of AN's big employing businesses, was the minister himself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has been pretty good at quoting from letters today. I have got a letter too. It is even more interesting than the one that he quoted from. I am prepared to table this letter. Maybe he should respond in kind with the letter that he refers to. This letter of 15 August to Mr Smorgan, the chair of AN, says, amongst other things:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AN may also proceed to advertise its businesses for sale as you propose in your letter of 4 July.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, he gave explicit approval for precisely what occurred. I seek leave to table that letter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4413">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YU5">Mr TANNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The minister has played very fast and loose with the truth. He said that there were no decisions. `We have not got any preconceptions. We have not made up our mind.' Why has he chosen to hide his own involvement in these decisions and his own pre-emptive strike to implement the Brew recommendations and slash hundreds, possibly thousands, of jobs from Australian National in South Australia and Tasmania? I will tell you why he has done this. All the time his plan was to release the Brew report only at the time he announced his decisions. He has actually said that. He is not going to let the workers of Australian National even have a say about their future. He is not going to allow them the possibility of challenging the conclusions of the Brew report or the issues being put forward, or of going through the figures. He has taken the position all along of saying, `No. We will release the report at the end of the process. People working at AN, you cannot have a role in this these issues. You cannot debate these issues. We are going to do it at the end of the process.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor forced that situation to be turned around. What has the minister done? He has done the opposite. He has said, `We have got to bring the decisions forward so that they coincide with the release of the report.' That is effectively what has happened&mdash;the day after the decision making process starts, things start happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will turn to his theatrical performance in question time today. We have heard this before. A couple of months ago we were told that Labor supposedly approved cutting 900 jobs. Last week it was 950; today it is 972. I will be very interested to read the correspondence he claims to have. I notice that he did not table it. I ask him to table it today so that we can scrutinise it properly. I would say that the former Labor government gave no approval whatsoever to job losses of 972, 950, 900&mdash;whatever the figure is that he claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor signed off on an enterprise bargain with the various unions for 197 job losses. That was agreed by the unions. There were to be voluntary redundancies for the year 1996&hyphen;97. That is the truth. The accusation that this <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> minister has made against the former minister is simply untrue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to the financial situation and his claim that Labor was fully advised of this situation. Yes, in 1992, Labor was made aware that ongoing subsidies would have to be paid to AN in order to ensure that National Rail could be established. National Rail was established separately because the states forced the Labor government to do it in order to have a proper interstate network.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at the Brew report figures outlining Australian National finances, you will see that 1993&hyphen;94 was the best AN year for some time. The year 1994-95 was not as good, but it was still better than 1991&hyphen;92 and 1992-93. What were the last figures available to the former minister? They were for the year 1994-95. In other words, there was no clear evidence of the serious financial crisis that this minister now claims was there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yes, the minister was alerted in the latter part of 1995 to the fact that there was a deterioration in the finances and he acted in response to this by specifying that he required a corporate plan to be developed and a management reorganisation, which was under way. All sorts of red herrings have been floating around in this debate. The comparison with ANL is another one. AN in its last annual report was in the black by about $200 million, assets over liabilities. Sadly, the same cannot be said of ANL.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Brew report is essentially a draconian and an extremist attack on jobs in regional Australia, jobs in South Australia and Tasmania. It is no coincidence that the author was one of the main hatchet people for Nick Greiner in the State Rail Authority. In the time he was there many jobs were lost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If it is implemented there will be a devastating impact&mdash;massive job losses; services under threat; regional economies, particularly in Port Augusta and Adelaide, seriously damaged; and a loss of heavy engineering and manufacturing skills in those areas. The opposition accepts that AN has some problems, that it needs some debt reduction strategy, but not of the panic nature that Mr Brew is suggesting. It is still clearly solvent and clearly capable of operating. Rail systems <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4414"> throughout the world are subsidised by governments and there are good reasons why this government should continue to subsidise Australian National. That is clearly the hidden agenda; that is what it wants to get away from&mdash;providing any sort of assistance to the rail system at all. The minister's approach has been to dither, to sit on the report, to try to blame Labor, to pretend that he is not involved in any nasty decisions at all and, most outrageously of all, to try to prevent those workers who face the sack from having any say in the decisions, from having any reasons given to them why they face those decisions and from having any ability to challenge those decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister is a bit like a tin&hyphen;pot dictator strutting around with a chest full of medals that he has awarded himself. He is loudly proclaiming the weakness of his enemies but at the first sound of gunfire he is bolting for the bunker. It is time he owned up to the deceptions&mdash;today being the latest one. It is time he stopped acting as though he was the shadow minister. He should front up and start taking the decisions, start involving workers in Australian National in those decisions and take a stand to protect regional jobs in South Australia and Tasmania. I don't mind listening to 10 minutes of rhetoric provided he gives me five minutes of truth. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note the subject of the MPI is job security at AN. I will make a couple of fundamental points. If there was ever a body responsible for lack of job security at AN it is the former Labor government. It is worth reminding members of this House that it was in 1983 that the Labor government was first elected. How many people worked at AN in 1983? Approximately 10,500 people worked for AN in 1983&mdash;the first year of a newly elected Labor government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirteen years later, when the tired, worn out and discredited Labor government was elected out of office in March 1996, how many people worked for AN? Two thousand, five hundred people. Eight thousand jobs had gone from AN during 13 years of Labor administration. Talk about job security at AN! <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> There was no job security at AN under 13 years of Labor administration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people who work at AN know only too well precisely what happened under Labor administration. The people at AN know only too well that any hope they had of turning their rail business into a viable organisation was killed off by the decision of the Labor government in 1991 to establish the National Rail Corporation, but more particularly the manner in which the National Rail Corporation was established. It was that Labor government that ensured that assets of AN and staff of AN and rolling stock and locos were handed over to the National Rail Corporation without adequate compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Along with the loss of all of those assets and the retention of all the debts that were attached to those assets, AN had a lot of its best rail routes taken off it and handed over to the National Rail Corporation without any further compensation&mdash;without any compensation at all. The manner in which the then Labor government introduced and established the National Rail Corporation sounded the death knell. If AN had any hope of providing job security to the people who worked there, that was killed off by Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor was only too well aware of the problems they had created. They chose to ignore them. In 1992, the then Minister for Transport was provided with information from the Department of Transport which highlighted the fact that the course the government was embarking on in relation to AN's management was a course to disaster. The government was warned in 1992. The government chose to take no action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again in 1995, the departments of transport and finance advised the then Minister for Transport and the then Minister for Finance that that course to disaster they had embarked upon for AN had been arrived at and that AN was in serious financial difficulty and was facing much greater losses than had been predicted in years past. The debts had mounted up and the future for AN looked extremely doubtful indeed. Yet the then government refused to act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I listened to the remarks of the shadow minister for transport, the honourable member <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4415"> for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), a few minutes ago. He was saying that we need this information on the table. I challenge the shadow minister and his colleagues to table in this parliament today&mdash;I have allowed him to table the correspondence from me&mdash;the information and the reports provided to the former Labor government in 1992 and again in 1995 which rang alarm bells about AN. Labor ignored those alarm bells and they now have to bear the responsibility for the problems that were generated as a consequence of ignoring those alarm bells that were rung by the departments of transport and finance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If those opposite are prepared to table that information, you will find that what is in the Brew report is mirrored in the reports presented by the departments of transport and finance. I challenge the Labor Party to table those documents so that we can see in this House precisely what information was ignored by the former Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important for members of this House to understand precisely how badly managed AN was under the former Labor government. After the Brew report had presented its findings, the organisation revealed a loss of up to $148 million in the last financial year, not the $26 million that the previous Labor government had said would be the loss for AN but a loss of up to $148 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an organisation so badly managed by the former Labor government that it now has debts and liabilities in excess of $1,000 million. I have heard the ridiculous proposition put by the shadow minister that AN is in the black, that AN has assets worth $1.2 billion and debts of only $1 billion. Wow! What a great business this one is! Losses of $148 million! The Brew report says that those losses will not get much better in the foreseeable future. This is a really good business! It is in the black!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, the $1.2 billion worth of assets the Labor Party claims AN has do not exist. They do not exist simply because so many of those assets are surplus to requirements. So many of those assets, despite being listed on the books as having a value, are now shunted up in yards like at Junee. You will find thousands of their wagons shunted around the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> countryside that have value relevant only to scrap.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you were to try to sell AN today in the marketplace you would not get $1.2 billion. You probably would not get one per cent of that. You would not get $120 million. You would not get $50 million, I dare say. It is a business that does not have the value the Labor Party claims it has. Therefore, it certainly has more debts than it has assets that can be realised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a business, as the Brew report points out, that is five times worse than ANL, a government business enterprise the former government said you could not give away. It is worth remembering that. This nonsense that AN is in the black is complete and utter drivel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point that is worth noting in all of this is that the Labor government when it was in office, in its last year, had a plan for AN. I talked about that plan last week and I talked about it again here today. That plan is the plan AN has been operating since 2 March of this year. That letter the honourable member sought to table today and which I permitted him to do&mdash;I permitted him to do it because it actually causes me no problem and indeed builds on my case&mdash;is as a result of a request from AN to implement aspects of their business plan approved by the former Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said to AN when they came to see us after the 2 March election, `We obviously have a problem with AN.' The chairman, Mr Jack Smorgan, said to us, `It is a far worse problem than the previous government was letting on.' I said, `We will have a review into its problems. That review will take several months. The government will need several months to consider the findings of that review. At the end of that we will give you a new business plan, but in the interim you will operate off your existing business plan.' At each step along the way, AN sought to do whatever it was they sought to do according to the business plan and I gave them approval to do that, except in this instance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4416"> I have asked AN not to implement that aspect of their business plan. The reason is that the South Australian government ap proached us and said that they wanted to implement the full terms of the rail transfer agreement, which they are fully entitled to do. It requires the Commonwealth to consult and negotiate with the South Australian government before any major asset disposal or any major changes occur within AN's operations. We are, of course, complying with that; hence, we will not be advertising, as has been suggested in that letter and by other reports circulating around AN and in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This plan that the shadow minister has highlighted in the letter he has tabled today was devised by the former Labor government. We need to understand the deception that has been engaged in by the previous Labor government. That deception goes to the very heart of this problem. Had the Labor government revealed information that was presented to them in 1992 and again in 1995, the people who worked for AN would be in a much better position today to know what their future is. Indeed, their future would be a darned sight more certain. But of course that plan was kept secret.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith last Thursday in a personal explanation tried to deny that this was the plan he had approved. He challenged me to make the point that this was actually not the truth. Indeed, in question time today I read a letter written by the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith when he was the Minister for Transport, which actually highlights the fact that on 18 September he approved the AN corporate plan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That corporate plan, as I pointed out in question time today, highlights the number of redundancies that AN was planning. On page 35 of the corporate plan approved by Labor we see 972 redundancies. They provided graphs so that if you were dim&hyphen;witted enough not to be able to read the figures you could at least see it in a pictorial sense, like reading the cartoons in the newspaper. It was all there in the plan&mdash;972 job redundancies and a whole host of other actions that were to be undertaken by AN with the authority of the former Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith last week in this House tried to deny that he had ap proved it. He had approved it, as had the now Leader of the Opposition when he was the Minister for Finance. He approved it and indeed congratulated AN on that plan. He sent that letter on about 19 September. Both of those two ministers, one now a senior shadow minister and the other the Leader of the Opposition in this Labor opposition, stand condemned because they knew and they did not tell people. They stood here in this House today pretending that all of this never happened under them. Indeed it was their plan. Indeed it was their incompetence. Indeed it was their mismanagement which has led AN to the plight it is in today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do not be fooled by the claims that are being made by some people that somehow or other this is a problem caused by the new coalition government. We are standing here today dealing with the problem of AN&mdash;not through our mismanagement, not through anything we did over the last 13 years but by the mismanagement and incompetence of 13 years of a Labor administration. We are prepared to take that responsibility on and try and solve it, and solve it we are aiming to do. That is why the Brew report was commissioned in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why this government is taking as long as is necessary to come up with a proper resolution to the problems of AN. We have started on that process by ensuring that the relationship between AN and the National Rail Corporation is appropriate and businesslike. National Rail Corporation was drawing on the services of AN without paying for them, all endorsed by the policies of the previous Labor government. It was that relationship between AN and NR that has helped bring down AN, which has helped cause those people who work for AN today to have their jobs cast in an uncertain light, and it is that that we are now trying to fix up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4417"> Indeed, in June or July this year we established a formal and proper businesslike arrangement between AN and NR. For example, in the seat of Adelaide we are trying to fix up the contaminated land. We have provided funding in that electorate that is going to fix that problem. That is a side issue, if you like, to the problems of AN, but it high lights the neglect by the previous Labor government. We have put money in the budget to start the clean&hyphen;up of that contaminated land in this current financial year as, indeed, the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) has campaigned on for so long.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make the point to the House today that Labor's solutions to these problems are to subsidise AN more and more and to ignore the problems of the debt. If you look at the government subsidies that are being paid today, according to Brew it is $30,000 per employee. If we do nothing and allow Labor's secret business plan for AN to go through to fruition, that subsidy will blow out to $220,000 per employee per year. Is that sensible use of taxpayers' funds? I challenge anybody to say that it is. These are the problems that we are trying to address. We have inherited them from the former Labor government. Subsidising the business further is not a solution to those problems. Getting on and addressing the basic inefficiencies, looking at better ways of marketing some of the services that are provided by AN, looking at some of the business units within AN and trying to provide new customers for that business are all part of a solution that we are seeking in our deliberations following the findings of the Brew report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One thing that people who work for AN can rest assured of is that, if the Labor government had been, by some misadventure, re&hyphen;elected into office on 2 March 1996, 972 jobs would be walking out of AN today under Labor's secret plan to rid AN of so many of its workers. The coalition government is trying to resolve the problems of AN in a way that will maximise job opportunities and ensure a decent and certain future for the people who work at AN.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, you could take the arguments of the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) as somewhat plausible if he would make available the full Brew report, but of course he will not. You just cannot take anything that he has said with any seriousness at all. This debate focuses quite clearly on the absolute incompetence and impotence of the 16 federal <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Liberals from South Australia and on the perfunctory state Liberal leadership in South Australia and Tasmania. This debate focuses quite clearly on the failure of the federal government to recognise the vulnerability of the economies of South Australia and Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This matter of public importance gives ample evidence of the abandonment of any policies to retain jobs in regional Australia. The regional centre of Port Augusta is to lose 550 jobs and $20 million out of its economy. It has been abandoned by this government. The loss of up to 2,500 jobs is a clear indicator of the government's total ignorance of what is necessary to develop viable employment policies in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This debate signals the government's abrogation of any semblance of the fair distribution of resources to all parts of Australia. This matter of public importance displays ample evidence of the government's cowardice in dealing effectively  with any matter on transport or infrastructure in this country. This is the beginning of leadership with referred responsibility to be taken by the authors of reports, in this case the Brew report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Government has proved too tough for the 16 Liberals from South Australia. Opposition for the last 13 years has put them onto a cushion of comfortableness and lethargy. They cannot raise themselves. They do not have the courage and the guts to get up and defend South Australia. Why are Senators Hill, Vanstone, Minchin, Chapman, Ferguson and Ferris so silent on the junking of South Australian jobs by this government? Where is the defence of South Australia and Tasmania from the members of this House? The member for Adelaide, who is here, and the member for Grey (Mr Wakelin), on whose electorates this will mostly impact, have been done over.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about the other eight members? Where is the leadership from the member for Mayo (Mr Downer)? Where is the so&hyphen;called tough negotiator, the member for Barker (Mr McLachlan)? There are four members in the cabinet and not a result for South Australia. The members for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4418"> Wakefield (Mr Andrew) and Sturt (Mr Pyne) have been around long enough. Why are they all so silent? And what about the new member for Boothby (Dr Southcott)? How does it feel to be completely overruled on any defence of South Australia that you may have meekly offered?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real crunch comes on the new members for Kingston (Ms Jeanes) and Makin (Mrs Draper). They are surplus to requirements and they are to be sacrificed because this government has no employment policy. It must be said to the members for Grey, Adelaide and Hindmarsh that they are obviously on the use&hyphen;by list as well, which is just as well because one particular Liberal state government, led by Premier Dean Brown, has led South Australia to fewer jobs now than when he took over the mantle in 1993, and has just received from this federal government the big battering ram.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is blatantly obvious that Liberals from South Australia, whether state or federal, simply do not grasp the vulnerability of the South Australian and Tasmanian economies. Under Labor, South Australia was always paid special attention. Its vulnerable economy was recognised. There are probably up to 20,000 defence jobs in South Australia courtesy of the former Labor government. We have the submarine contract and the expansion of British Aerospace and all the spin&hyphen;offs that that encouraged. What about the car industry? Under the Liberals there would have been no expansion whatsoever at Mitsubishi or General Motors.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government totally abrogates its responsibility for national leadership in its response to the Brew report. It is a fascinating report. The South Australian government is so on top of protecting South Australian jobs that you could have knocked me over with a feather when I found out that it did not even put in a submission. The Labor Party did, the unions did, the City of Port Augusta did, everybody else did, but not the Premier. The Premier did not care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about the Brew report? Actually, a very doctored version is the only document available. In relation to collection of evidence, substantive arguments, rational analysis and looking after the national interest, it is not available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What a strange way this government operates. Senator Tambling tables the Brew report one day, apparently explaining that no decisions are being made by the government. He says that any proposals are yet to be decided. The transport minister, the member for Hume, says the same&mdash;`Don't panic, the government will make the decisions, not the Brew report.' But the following day, 24 hours later, Australian National puts out press releases seeking expressions of interest for four out of eight key businesses, which included workshops and infrastructure services&mdash;maintenance. They explicitly said that there would be no sale of the track corridor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hang on a minute, pass that over me again. This mirrors exactly, Transport Minister, the Brew report. What a remarkable coincidence! Transport minister creates coincidence, bettering the odds of a cross lotto win! The member for Adelaide then asked the transport minister a question in question time, and the minister predictably blamed the former Labor government for the failed corporate plan. Hang on a minute! Isn't there an obvious contradiction in the minister's spin-doctored line? On day one of the tabling of the report Labor is blamed for doing nothing, but on day two it is a different story&mdash;Australian National is taking drastic action. The question needs to be asked: who gave approval for the drastic action by AN? Was it the letter to AN on 15 August, Transport Minister? AN's press release is pretty explicit. The transport <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4419"> minister may wish to reflect on the fact that, by omission, he may have misled the parliament. In fact, he basically acknowledged that in question time today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government plans to privatise Australian National, kill rail in South Australia and 2,500 jobs in the process. This is a sell-off of South Australian jobs and industry. Is there no appreciation whatsoever in this government of what tariff reductions and the restructuring of Australian industry have done to the South Australian economy? I say to the member for Adelaide and the member for Grey that we have fewer jobs now than we had three years ago. The Liberal's plan, for which the transport minister wants to rely on the Brew report, is simply a suicide note for AN&mdash;a suicide note for their workers and a suicide note for their families. It is telling them to get up and get out of Port Augusta.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The state Premier refused to make a submission to the Brew report. The Labor Party did, the unions did and the City of Port Augusta did. The Premier will not even meet AN workers. Will the South Australian Premier, Dean Brown, guarantee to use his legal powers under the railways transfer agreement to try to save the jobs? Will any Liberal on that side stand up and fight for South Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">South Australia and Tasmania are to get one big kick in the guts by this government. Port Augusta could lose up to 550 jobs and $20 million out of the economy. The closure of Islington will see hundreds more jobs go. The recommendations in the Brew report, just released, provide no access to information on which decisions and recommendations will be based. Rational debate on this issue is impossible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report, which threatens thousands of South Australian and Tasmanian jobs, cannot properly be examined. This lack of information prevents the capacity of workers, unions and local government, even that dopey state government in South Australia, to participate in a proper debate. Is this the Liberal's view, Transport Minister, of transparent, honest, fair government?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the enormity of what the government plans for AN and its serious impact on South <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australia's economy, is there one Liberal on that side of the House who will stand up and ask for a full copy of the Brew report so that there can be open and honest discussion about its findings and recommendations? All we want is one Liberal with some courage, integrity and honesty to stand up for South Australia. Are there any takers on that side of the House? What about the member for Makin, the member for Kingston or the member for Grey? No. What about the member for Adelaide? No. The member for Hindmarsh? No. The member for Boothby? No. The member for Sturt? No. The member for Wakefield? No. The member for Mayo? No. The member for Barker? No. There you have it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the employment situation. I think job security of workers at Australian National was the title of the MPI. Let us look at job security Labor style. When they came to power in 1983 there were 10,500 jobs. How many do we have now? We have 2,500. That is job security Labor's way. That is unbelievable hypocrisy on Labor's part. In 1983 the figure was 10,500 and now it is 2,500. What is more, 972 will go under your plan this financial year. It is quite remarkable. Labor's employment program was to lose 8,000 jobs, and they have the hide to talk about job security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) brought to our attention on the issue of Telstra yesterday this hypocrisy on jobs&mdash;all this crocodile tear stuff about Telstra. We looked at Roma. Under Labor's reign it went from 250 to 50.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4420">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the overall employment situation in Australia from the time of the `recession we had to have'. Over the last six years the Labor government had managed to provide just under 5,000 full-time jobs per year. That is why they got kicked out. Yet they have the hide to come into this place today and talk about employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rail is a tough, body&hyphen;breaking business. If one has travelled on that section of rail through the sandhills this side of the Nullarbor, one can only think about our heritage and our history when in the hot sun that railway was built in those times. Railway has a very proud history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Times have changed. We moved into an era which, Labor has to acknowledge, saw a great loss of jobs in rail generally throughout Australia. The time has come to look to the future. That is why this government is taking its responsibility very seriously and is gathering all the forces of government to address Australia's rail future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we look at the loss of jobs in rail in the 13 years of Labor, we see that the only way to provide opportunities for rail, particularly for people in Port Augusta, Port Lincoln, Adelaide and Tasmania, is to take a new approach. I have great respect for the Port Augusta community. When Mayor Joy Baluch, Ian McSporran and Colleen Hutchison from the Northern Development Board and I went to Sydney in July to see what opportunities there may be for rail, we got a very positive reception, and it became very clear to us that rail did have a future. But not under Labor. Not through Labor's way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I talked to the work force at Port Augusta, and they said, `I don't want to work where the employer does not want me to be. I would prefer to be out there doing something else.' Other people who have just recently left, only a week or two ago, said, `No human should be treated this way.' There was the uncertainty, the death by a thousand cuts&mdash;based predominantly on the Labor decision of 1991 to create National Rail. Labor understands that. Port Augusta understands that.

<PARA>The motion before the House today is essentially procedural in nature. It will allow the government to make the regulations necessary to implement the new woodchip export regime that we proposed, and it is widely known and understood, I believe, without exposing those new regulations to the risk of successful legal challenge.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former regulations were introduced hurriedly and without adequate consultation by the previous government in November last year. They lacked intellectual certainty and quality. They were illogical. They were unsustainable. That is why several months ago I gave notice of this government's intention to disallow those regulations. At the time, the government was still deliberating over this most difficult issue and, had I not given notice at that time, we would have limited prematurely the options open to us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Subsequent to that, the government announced its intention to establish a new woodchip export regime to operate during the transition to regional forest agreements. The key elements of the new regime are: retention of the current 5.251 million tonne ceiling on export volumes, additional quantities of up to one million tonnes of woodchips to be sourced from sawmill residues and silvicultural thinnings from regrowth forests, and case by case approval for the export of woodchips sourced from the clearing of degraded private forests for the establishment of hardwood plantations. In addition, the first and second stage licensing system will be abolished, the licences issued will be for terms of up to three years and effective from 1997 and, finally, woodchip exports from areas not covered by regional forest agreements will be ceased from 1 January 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously, there are similarities between the government's announced policy on woodchip exports and the regulations which operated previously. There was in fact some ill&hyphen;informed banter&mdash;which is probably the best way to put it&mdash;about this place that suggested these similarities meant that the government could not give legislative effect to its policy. This was always untrue. That has not stopped those who are opposed to the implementation of rational forest policy in this country from promoting all sorts of weird and wonderful distortions of reality. They have really become extremely skilled at making a great deal out of nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week, the former regulations were deemed to have been disallowed in accordance with section 48 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, and that brings me to the purpose <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4422"> of the motion now before the House. Section 49 of the Acts Interpretation Act provides that any regulation being the same in substance as the regulation so disallowed, or deemed to have been disallowed, has no effect if made within six months of disallowance, but it also identifies two circumstances where this provision does not apply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The circumstances relevant to the motion now before the House states that a regulation the same in substance may be made where the house of parliament in which a regulation was deemed to have been disallowed resolves to approve the making of such a regulation. Passage of this motion is essential if the government is to give full legislative effect to its policy. However, like the regulations which will be made in the near future, it is not essential for the government to implement its policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The regulations in existence today, the old unprocessed wood regulations which predated Labor's ill-conceived arrangements, are adequate to implement the government's transitional woodchip licensing system, but it is the government's very strong preference to now secure the new arrangements in regulations. There are obvious benefits in doing so, not the least of which is keeping the pressure on the states to stay the course with implementing regional forest agreements. This will be achieved by ensuring that woodchip exports cease from areas not covered by regional forest agreements by the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said this, I want to make it absolutely plain that I am completely confident that the cooperative federalism&mdash;in which we have engaged since coming to government, in contrast to the very heavy-handed approach of the previous government&mdash;will ensure that the year 2000 sanction will not be required. It will not have to be used. It will not have to be invoked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The public has not been misled into believing that all woodchip exports from our forests will cease after 2000. Woodchips will continue to be exported after regional forest agreements as part of an integrated, sustainable and internationally competitive native forest logging industry&mdash;and I will return to this in a moment. I should just note, lest <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> anybody wanted to make a political point out of that, that the previous government's position, despite their attempts to hide officegate or whatever on this matter, was in fact precisely the same. So let us not have any fudging or attempts to mislead in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, I will return to this shortly, but I want firstly to talk about the other key aim of the national forest policy statement&mdash;that is, the creation of a comprehensive, adequate and representative forest reserve system. There are those who would have it that our forests are not well protected. Essentially, this is simply not the case. A little over a fifth of our forests enjoy some form of protection, whether they be national parks, state conservation reserves or other protected areas. This is substantially more than the international benchmark of 10 per cent of existing forests set by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. We have already the basis for the CAR reserve system envisaged under the national forest policy statement, an outcome to which this government is absolutely committed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government remains committed to seeking 15 per cent of the distribution of each forest type that existed prior to European settlement as a target, but it must be understood clearly that this target will be extremely difficult or impossible to achieve in some areas, most particularly in northern New South Wales and south-east Queensland. In these areas, the government will proceed carefully, taking full and proper account of the social and economic consequences that would flow from locking away large tracts of forest. We will not decimate&mdash;I repeat, we will not decimate&mdash;rural communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to set down on the public record a few facts about the forest industries. In particular, it needs to be understood that the timber industry is sawlog driven. Forest coupes are felled to supply timber for milling. Woodchips are produced from the leftovers&mdash;from the logs that failed to make milling grade, from sawmill and timber harvesting residue and from silviculture thinnings in regrowth forests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that a large volume of the timber that is felled ends up as woodchips&mdash; <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4423">or, rather, could end up as woodchips if the industry were not so heavily constrained by current regulation. This integrated harvesting, the taking of both sawlogs and pulpwood, makes sense. It underpins the profitability of our native forest based industry. It maximises the use of the available resource and adds significantly to the nation's export income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Integrated harvesting is more than merely good economics; it represents good environmental practice as well in many of the eucalypt forests of Australia where the forest canopy needs to be opened up in order to get the forest to regenerate. Prior to European settlement, fire was the regenerator; in the managed forests of today, where fire is feared, modified clear-fell harvesting fulfils this role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In those forests where intensive logging is inappropriate, state forest managers permit selective logging only. The message here is that the harvesting method is tailored to the forest type. As the member for Page (Mr Causley), who is here today, would well know, those forestry management techniques are highly sophisticated, very carefully thought through and increasingly are reflective of a culture of immense expertise. That needs to be clearly understood.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the previous export arrangements the timber industry, regulated by the states through strict planning procedures and codes of environmental practice, was not allowed to utilise much of the wood it harvested. That is the simple reality that was left behind by the absurdity of the previous government's attempts to satisfy the Greens. They failed in that, so they got it wrong from an industry perspective, wrong from a conservation perspective&mdash;and wrong certainly from the point of view of regional Australia, as is quite adequately reflected by the make&hyphen;up of the opposition today: wrong with a capital `W' in regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The results of their politicisation and cynicism in this whole thing was that a large amount of wood was either burned or left to rot on the forest floor&mdash;which, in itself, heightens future fire risk and seriously retards post-harvest regeneration. The benefits of collecting, processing and selling this wood are quite obvious.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come to a very interesting point; it is very reflective and I think it should be well taken in that it indicates the way in which this debate is so often manipulated for cynical ends. Often, we hear the claim that 80 per cent of Australians are opposed to export woodchipping. But Australians need to understand the origins of this particular claim. It has its genesis in a survey conducted by environmentalists a decade ago in which respondents were asked, in essence, whether they approved of Australia's native forests being felled and exported to Japan as woodchips.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can understand why, in response to a question of that sort, 80 per cent of Australians might answer no. But of course we had the former minister on the other side with her outstanding record of understanding forest industries! So magnificent was that record that the previous minister for primary industries, who had to be brought in to clean up the mess left behind by the previous minister for resources, took himself over to Western Australia on a weekend to fly around photographing the forests in that state. He did this so that he could go back to cabinet and prove to cabinet that the ex&hyphen;minister there&mdash;and I will be very interested to hear what she has to say in a moment or two&mdash;did not know what she was talking about, at the least, or, at the worst, was deliberately manipulating the debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us just concentrate for a moment on the question of integrity in this debate, because another survey on the very same issue, conducted by the Roy Morgan Research Centre last year and couched in less emotive terms, produced a completely different result. The question was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When trees are harvested for timber, there are defective logs and residue that cannot be used in sawmills. In some areas, they are converted into woodchips to produce paper products. In other areas, woodchipping of residue is banned and, after the removal of sawlogs, the remainder is burnt. Recent studies have shown that chipping of this material could provide significant export earnings, substantial job opportunities and a base for further processing. In your opinion, should all defective logs and residue be allowed to be converted to woodchips or should existing bans be maintained? <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4424"> </PARA>
<PARA>Not surprisingly, more than three-quarters of respondents supported conversion of residues to woodchips. That is what happened.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The visual contrast between a pile of woodchips and a forest is stark, but it does not somehow illegitimise the forest industry. It really ought to be of great interest to Australians to note that here we are as a country of just 18 million people on a vast island continent where we produce such vast quantities, for example, of beef&mdash;as the member for Dawson (Mrs De-Anne Kelly), immediately behind me, would be well aware&mdash;that we export 70 per cent of it because we do not need it here, it is surplus to our requirements; such vast quantities of grain that we export vast amounts of that as well. The same applies to dairy, to a whole range of agricultural pursuits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet, in the case of this industry, such an utter mess was made of it by the previous regime that we are importing $3 billion worth of everybody else's timber and paper product. In net terms, around 10 per cent of our trade deficit is made up of timber and paper products. Why? Because of the cynicism, the opportunism and the lack of policy, as opposed to politics, that the previous government engaged in&mdash;as is well recognised by many on your own side.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just wish you would raise some of these issues a bit more often to let me get some of these facts out in the open, because there are a lot more of them to come. The trouble with you mob is that you cannot agree amongst yourselves on what they are. I would really welcome the opportunity to highlight that a bit more&mdash;but, unfortunately, you will not give me that opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the new government announced these new woodchip export arrangements in July, it was acknowledged that they would not meet all the demands of all of the stakeholders. They remain, however, an appropriate and well thought through compromise between competing interests during the transitional period between now and the establishment of regional forest agreements in all the major wood producing native forests of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are very fortunate in this country&mdash;we can have our cake too. We can have a better than world-class conservation reserve system where we preserve magnificent forests for this and all future generations at the same time as we can have a sensible and sustainable forest industry, given that we are a people who love to use timber and timber-based products&mdash;and we do use vast quantities of them. Therefore, we ought to be sensible enough and mature enough to be able to put in place policy parameters which deliver desirable outcomes on all fronts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To that end, the motion before the House today reflects a very sound policy position. It is necessary to give legislative effect to the new regulations. I recommend them to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition is opposing the motion that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) has moved today for two key reasons. The first is to highlight in the House the administrative incompetence that has been involved in us getting to this point. It has not come through any accident either. What has happened is that the minister, in his frenzy to undo the woodchip ceilings that had been put in place by the previous Labor government and in his frenzy to get in here and satisfy that constituency of his that wants to see them cut down, chipped, put in ships and shipped <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4425"> overseas, has whipped into this House and moved this motion that ends the previous administrative regulations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He now has us in the situation today where, because he has not been able to get it up on his administrative timetable&mdash;he has not met the deadlines that were required of him when he did this some months ago&mdash;we are now, as of today, in the hiatus. Now we need a motion in the House of Representatives to introduce the regulation to give effect to the policy changes that you intend to make.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we are opposing this to highlight the fact that you did not get it right. You came in here some months ago and said what you were going to do, and that did not happen. It was all about your frenzy to scrap the ceiling on woodchips, even though you have stood at the dispatch box today&mdash;and, when you go back and read over your <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> transcript, you will see this&mdash;and said that you intend to keep in place the ceiling of 5.2 million tonnes of export woodchips that was put in place by the previous Labor government but, by the way, you are increasing it by one million tonnes&mdash;`but, by the way'&mdash;and then you are saying where those million tonnes are coming from.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the message that goes to all of Australia. Despite the debate, the battles, the blockades, the ongoing policy debate in this nation that has taken place year by year, when we did settle on putting a ceiling on export woodchips in place, what have you done? You have raced in here to lift it by one million tonnes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the shadow minister for resources and energy, I come to this debate with a very pro-job, pro-development and pro-industry position. What is it that we are trying to achieve? We are trying to achieve investment in value adding in this industry in Australia. What has been achieved was achieved by two key policy measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first was the signalling to the industry that it will no longer have conservative&hyphen;style unlimited access to public forests, which it had year after year. By signalling to the industry that those days were over and that it will have to start investing in plantation, we <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> drove it to begin to invest in plantation instead of woodchipping public forests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second one was that, by saying to the industry that there will be a ceiling on export woodchips and that that ceiling will be phased down, the very clear signal to overseas investors was: if you want to use Australian woodchips in pulp mills and if you want to produce value added products from Australian woodchips, then you will have to invest in a pulp mill in Australia.</PARA>

It is going back up so you can continue to have your export woodchips. We will continue to make the supplies that you need available.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other aspect of the signal coming out of the new government is that, even if you do invest in a pulp mill in Australia and even if you do invest in downstream processing, you may well have a problem with resource guarantees because we are opening up the guarantees for the exporters again. The people with the contracts for the chips will be in Taiwan, Japan or elsewhere; they certainly will not be in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister got up here and tried to draw an analogy between cows and trees and whatever. For God's sake! Farmers grow their own cows. If they want to turn them into beef and export them, we all help and encourage it. But there is a bit of a difference between a privately owned cow and some public forest, for God's sake! Don't you understand? The fact of the matter is that because of those ceilings we had the industry there. This was <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4426"> the stupidest possible time to give the industry a signal that there was no longer a requirement to invest in plantation in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister, in his own speech, signified the problem with the states. Except where it is world heritage areas or except where the national government has been given or has taken a specific right in forest management in particular areas, most of Australia's public forest is managed by state governments. Most of those state governments see themselves as operators of state forests for the timber industry. Most of those state governments have been involved in managing the forest to transform it to the needs of the timber industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those state governments have fought bitterly. For 13 years the federal Labor government made every attempt to lock them into regional forest agreements that protected public forests and forced investment into plantations. The minister knows very well that, if you give the states the slightest signal that you are weakening on forest policy, they will weaken on the regional forest agreements.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have slipped in here in a frenzy and done your regulations. What have you done? You have lifted Labor's export woodchip ceiling by a million tonnes. It was not necessary to do that to provide for the private tree farming increase. You understand and I understand the merits of giving some encouragement to the private tree farming industry.

We will be able to save more forest than was ever envisaged by the former government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who cannot remember the historic meeting involving the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson), all the environmental groups, those members who were interested and the timber industry? They joined together in one room and the Prime Minister said, `Come back to me any time you like&mdash;within a few days if possible, in three weeks if need be. Come back to me with an answer to our problems.' And they did. They came back and they put to us that we had to make a decision on behalf of the people.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to address this issue today because I think it is important to look at the whole concept. It is not just a question of whether or not the woodchipping arrangements are satisfactory from the point of view of industry&mdash;I think we can clearly say that it has already been demonstrated that that is not true. It is also a question of the impact that it has on the national forest policy generally. With my responsibility as shadow minister for the environment, I was obviously very keen to have a good hard look at the new regulations when they emerged from government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We heard very early on&mdash;in fact, during the election campaign&mdash;that this was to be an area, like many others, where there would be no change. I want to emphasise that fact because I think it is important for members opposite to realise that their Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the then Leader of the Opposition, very clearly said to the various conservation groups and the public through press statements and answers to questions during the campaign that there would be no change in this area. No change was contemplated. There would be no change from the existing regime. We would not get any more woodchips. A Liberal government would basically follow through with the national forest strategy and the wood and paper strategy.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4429">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As was the case with a lot of other areas, this has shown to be absolutely the reverse of what happened. In so many cases, the Liberal Party promised that it would do what we were doing if it got to government, but it has now done precisely the opposite. This is one of the great betrayals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whatever else you might say about it, the community understood when they elected this government that it would not make a change to this regime. So the changes the Liberal government have introduced have been in the face of very explicit statements that were made during the election campaign by the current Prime Minister in front of every conservation group in the country and with beautiful pictures being taken in the forest. I think the imagery is not lost on a lot of people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This series of woodchip decisions are a setback for the environment. I just want to draw the minister's attention to the views of the Australian people on this matter. The minister was quoting from a couple of sources that I think both of us, for different reasons, regarded as perhaps less than ideal, having either bias toward the Greens or bias toward the industry side. I suggested, by way of interjection, that he could do well to look at the Australian Election Studies which are conducted after each election. In those studies, people are asked how they responded to various issues and how important those issues were in determining their vote. I think it is important for all of us, as we go to the community and talk to them about industry policy in this area and forest policy generally, that we know the views of the community at large.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister himself very clearly indicated that he understood&mdash;indeed, he claimed&mdash;that the environment was now a mainstream issue. It was not the province of the fringe groups. He underlined that he understood, even if members opposite do not, that this is something where there is a lot of unanimity across the community&mdash;your voters, our voters, swinging voters, old people, young people, the rich and the poor. The environment enjoys much greater prominence <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> as an issue of importance in changing people's votes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at those fairly robust and reliable Australian Election Studies, they tell us that in 1987&mdash;and this is a rise from about five per cent in the previous decades&mdash;31 per cent of people said that the environment was important in determining their vote. That figure is not 100 per cent, but it is almost higher than the percentage for any other single issue at that time. The issues of employment and education are sometimes ahead of the issue of the environment. That rise from five per cent to 31 per cent was a revolution. It stuck. By 1990 the figure was 52 per cent. It was sustained at pretty much that level, even in 1993 when the environment was not a particularly strong issue in the election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am looking forward to seeing the 1996 data, given the view that the opposition put forward prior to the election about its environment policy. I am sure that people would have considered it important, but they would have believed, particularly on forest issues, that there was not going to be any difference between the two parties. That is what they were encouraged to believe&mdash;that there were no differences. Therefore, they could discount the environment when they were casting their vote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not only the environment generally that is considered important. There is also widespread consensus, using these same studies, on the specific issues that deserve the attention of government. For example, in the 1990 AES&mdash;the Australian Election Studies survey&mdash;88 per cent of people nominated greenhouse as a very or fairly urgent problem; 93 per cent nominated soil degradation. Eighty per cent of Australians&mdash;this is a different survey from the one the minister quoted&mdash;considered the logging of forests to be an issue of fairly or very urgent importance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing that needs to be understood by members opposite as they go about undoing the policies that they promised to the community is that even though the respondents generally, the voters, were fairly pessimistic about the prospect for resolving some of these problems&mdash;and, as it turns out, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4430"> rightly so&mdash;they were generally prepared to trade off some of their economic wellbeing in order to protect and improve the environment. They tell us, for instance, that they are prepared to pay higher taxes to engage in industry restructuring; in other words, they are prepared to make some trade&hyphen;offs that they believe are important for the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Take the issue of logging as an example. I am not necessarily recommending this; I am just trying to lay out the community view. If as representatives we do not represent the community view, then we are doing a very considerable disservice. In these same questions, when people were asked whether the government should ban logging, even if it meant a loss of jobs and export income, 47 per cent&mdash;a figure that surprised me&mdash;actually agreed with that proposition; 33 per cent were neutral; and 20 per cent thought we should keep logging. Similarly, 66 per cent said that they were prepared to pay higher taxes in order to increase spending on the environment, while 21 per cent opposed such imposts. I am not recommending those as policy positions, but simply indicating that this a very strong view held in the community.</PARA>

So Australians are saying, `We think you should get a balance between the environment and economic growth.' A further 18 per cent actually ranked the environment ahead of growth. A very small minority, especially in my own state, ranked economic growth ahead of the environment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to turn now to the specific changes that have been recommended and to indicate why I think, from an environmental point of view, they are devastating. I know the minister seeks to make reassuring noises that this really will result in no change, that governments will still be able to find the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> necessary reserves to meet national forest policy criteria. I point out that, simultaneously with introducing these changed woodchip export regimes, they are actually changing the criteria in the national forest policy&mdash;something they also said they would not do.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at the changes, in my view, they spell disaster for a lot of our native forests; I agree that that is not so for all of them. The increase in the ceiling is, in some ways, perhaps not even the most significant setback for forest policy. The shift away from those criteria was not even announced as a matter of public policy but was slipped into a document circulated to the states. That is the way to do it, according to the minister. You don't make the announcement, you just change the rules as you go along. It is clear to a great many Australians that native forests are under threat from the coalition's plans.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The members opposite, including the minister, would have us believe that the change to the ceiling is the only significant addition to these woodchip regula <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4431"> tions.

He would like us to believe that that is the only change.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, in addition to the change in woodchip ceilings, there is a very significant change, too, in the approval for what could amount to unlimited logging on privately owned land. I think the conservation movement too understands how significant that is. They have focused their concern on that issue because they know that if you are really interested in maintaining a decent level of vegetation cover in this country, you cannot allow for that open slather on privately owned land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, a lot of it is in the hands of the big woodchipping companies. So it is an almost certain guarantee that the woodchip exports from this country will not be 5.2 million tonnes or 6.2 million tonnes, but well in excess of that&mdash;and the minister knows that. He says it will be a case&hyphen;by&hyphen;case analysis. I, for one, will be fascinated to see how he manages to define a degraded forest, in light of what we understand to be the national forest policy where, in some cases, the only forest that is representative of its type may well have suffered some form of degradation over years of logging and interference from other sources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have here is an incentive to clear more land when every environment report recommends against such a practice. It is not only bad from the point of view of forest policy, it is also bad from the point of view of general environment policy. I am sure that, if the minister sits back from that from time to time, he will realise that that, and the removal of penalties to the states not making sufficient progress towards a comprehensive system of forest reserves, will completely derail the national forest policy. You will have a lot of forests on private land depleted. You will have state governments with no incentive to meet the comprehensive, adequate reserve system requirements. Simultaneously, you will have a government basically saying that they do not care any more about the criteria. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, they have already moved to water down the Commonwealth's criteria for a national system of forest reserves. This is critical. The minister says, `Oh, well, we're above the IUCN recommended level.' Yes, we are, in some cases, but has Australia ever been frightened of being in front? Do we always have to come from behind in the eyes of this government? If you look at their attitude to greenhouse and other issues, why is it that they think that Australia should be second or third or last in the line in this area? Because we are a relatively new nation from the point of view of European settlement, should we go the way of Europe and North America? Should we destroy all our forests? Should we go the way of developing nations in South&hyphen;East Asia who, without adequate controls, are ripping into theirs as well?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was precautionary and decent. The 15 per cent level was one that was settled on after a lot of discussion as being reasonable and achievable and without significant dislocation to the forest industry. I think that is a fair conclusion from a whole lot of independent observers, not just on the conservation side. The worst impact here will be on high conservation value native forests. As I say, I think it is worse than the green light to record levels of woodchip exports. There is no guarantee at all now.

I commend you for that amount of personal power, but it is bad for the environment that Senator Hill is always trailing along behind you saying, `Yes, Minister, no, Minister', when it comes to the protection of our natural resources. We have no guarantees from this minister and no guarantees from the Minister for the Environment that the goal of establishing a truly comprehensive adequate and representative reserve system can be <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4432"> achieved, because the criteria are all being diluted. In my own state of Western Australia, the government there and CALM have the view that we have only got two forest types&mdash;karri and jarrah. They  overlook all the regional and other varieties that it is clearly very important to preserve. With a state regime like that how can we guarantee, even with a 15 per cent criterion, that we are going to get decent preservation?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to scrapping the 15 per cent benchmark, the coalition has abandoned the previous government's sliding scale to protect 60 to 100 per cent of old growth forests depending on the percentage remaining within each forest type. We have already heard the minister hint at the fact that it is going to be too difficult to achieve some of these criteria in some places. They have done away with the sliding scale and they have done away with the target&mdash;it now becomes something they might achieve. The end effect of that is that rare and biologically diverse species remaining in our old growth forests will be bulldozed without a whimper from the federal government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the consequence of the combination of policy changes we have seen from this government: a change to the ceilings; forestry on private land leading to an increase in woodchip exports; and a reduction, a dilution, of the criteria necessary to achieve decent forest protection in this society. The green movement is now awake up to you. The wider community will gradually realise that what you told them during the election campaign was the opposite, in fact, of what you intended to do and what you are now doing in government.</PARA></SPEECH>

That is the reality that we face. I find it almost unbelievable. I have to say that I am still stunned. When we had a close look at the budgetary circumstances that confronted us, it was revealed that not only were we facing a deterioration in terms of that big black hole of about $8 billion&hyphen;odd dollars, but also that over the past five years the previous regime&mdash;which prided itself on being responsible economic managers and which publicly wanted the Australian community to swallow the line that they were responsible economic managers&mdash;had, once you stripped away the bells and whistles and the asset sales and so forth, racked up a total of $69,000 million in deficits. That is a truly horrifying amount.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The increase in Australia's position in terms of drawings on private sector savings and what have you is utterly unsustainable. It really puts at risk our capacity to forge ahead and to offer everybody maximum opportunities for economic self&hyphen;determination. It is vitally important that that issue be tackled, and we have sought to tackle it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of my portfolio area, I want to make it quite plain that there is nothing more important for primary industry than to get pressure of interest rates off. If you sit down and do the maths to establish just what an inhibitor high interest rates are to the farm sector, particularly when those interest rates are higher than those of our competitors abroad, you really do come to some startling conclusions. The figures are quite amazing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On a typical small business loan taken out by Australian farmers to be repaid over a number of years, the extra amount of money Australian farmers would have to pay over and above what they would pay if they were on Japanese, American or even British interest rates is truly horrifying. It can make the difference between farms surviving tough times and farms going under. We have far too many of them going under.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) is sitting just behind me and he knows only too well what effect high interest rates have had in difficult circumstances out there. We had to get the pressure off them. I have <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> been very relieved to note that farmers and rural leaders right across the nation have given the coalition the thumbs up for the approach we have taken in the budget repair task.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that it was not easy. It is never easy. No&hyphen;one&mdash;we ought to make this quite plain&mdash;enjoys having to withdraw financial support or contributions from anyone in the community. We in this place would all like to be generous and offer great largesse in every instance. That is almost the nature of the breed, yet the reality is that we had to make many decisions of a difficult nature in order to rein in the very alarming situation that we confronted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a member of the Expenditure Review Committee&mdash;one of the six who had that rather unpleasant task, and it was an unpleasant task&mdash;I do record my gratitude for the way in which rural Australia has accepted the fairness and equity, in every sense of those words, when it comes to considering the nation's future and the desirability of what we have proposed. Mr Deputy Speaker Vaile, I believe you would have discovered that in your electorate, particularly amongst the rural people with whom I am most concerned tonight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we really have is a strategy which will reduce the deficit by some $7.2 billion over the next two years, and we will move to a modest surplus over three years. Ironically, it meets the very test that the shadow Treasurer set for us and said that we ought to be meeting when he was trying to paste us on television. It represents a two per cent structural adjustment, if you like, as it seeks to bring revenue into line with outlays during the period of fiscal repair&mdash;the three years over which the budget surplus will be achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is enormously reassuring to note that the confidence engendered from this broad approach to economic management has seen a reduction in interest rates. It is very important to recognise and acknowledge that, in the context of a lot of sometimes quite ill-informed banter about the importance of regional Australia and what we are doing to them, getting these fundamentals right for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4435"> rural economies is the greatest contribution a government can make. It is the No. 1 thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That half a per cent cut in interest rates is worth around $90 million minimum to the farm sector, particularly given that all banks have passed it on. That is a very substantial amount of money freed up not only in offering relief to farmers with big debts but also in enabling those who do not face such difficult circumstances to have the increased opportunity to do things like start reinvesting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That leads me to a very important aspect of our budgetary approach, which is to acknowledge the very real need to boost domestic savings. One of the issues frequently raised with me as I move around the bush is the very high level of foreign investment in much of Australia's rural infrastructure, particularly in the processing sector. The government welcomes foreign investment. We recognise that it has always been the case in Australia that a considerable degree of foreign investment has been in our interest, whether it has been to build our railways and bridges in the old days or to build modern processing plants today to help participate in modernising and developing our economy. However, it needs to be noted that it is an extraordinarily important principle that Australia's saving levels need to be boosted so that we encourage investment by Australians in our industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do record my real concern that there is a reluctance on the part of the Australian community to invest in, for example, the food processing sector. Our abattoirs through to the sophisticated food processing industries that are very much the key to our trading performance in Asia in the future all have seen, in my view, starvation of funding from Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is important that we recognise the need to withdraw the hand of government in terms of its heavy impost on people's savings, people's pockets, in recent years; to leave more money, if you like, in private circulation to boost the size of the domestic pool of savings, which will obviously free up money for investment outside of government activities. It is vitally important that we get the private sector going again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The key outcome for primary industry is that this budget keeps costs down. It main tains an appropriate support base whilst making a real contribution to expanding the options in terms of market access and market facilitation in the future. There are other aspects of the budget that are obviously of great interest and importance to the rural community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The retention of the diesel fuel rebate in very difficult economic circumstances is a recognition of the importance of the scheme to keeping costs down, not just for domestic production, not just for our farming and mining sectors and the jobs that they provide locally in terms of those activities on the ground, but also because they are overwhelmingly export industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No sensibly managed economy features high levels of indirect taxation on exports. Indeed, I think in that regard the point needs to be made again that there appear to be some who would still paint the diesel fuel rebate scheme as a subsidy. I will continue to argue, until I am blue in the face, that it is no such thing. It is a mechanism for avoiding taxation on very significant input costs for many rural people&mdash;many farmers and many miners who are, of course, major contributors to Australia's export performance. In fact, the activities covered by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy contribute nothing less than 80 per cent to Australia's merchandise exports. To a huge slab of that activity, fuel is a very important input indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of other costs that are kept down in the budget, there is a $12 million contribution continuing to AQIS meat inspection, to the red meat program. The previous government failed, year in and year out, to deliver effective and meaningful reform. Despite the fact that industry currently pays very considerably too much for the services delivered, there is still a requirement for an ongoing subsidy. We will continue to provide that, although our objective is to wind it back in the near future as we move to a more efficient regime that costs less as we seek to restructure and rationalise in the meat program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the support base that is provided by the government for agriculture, we have been quite active in the exceptional circumstances arrangements for drought. We have <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4436"> found another $90 million, a very substantial amount of money, to continue assistance mainly in eastern Australia, in a circumstance where much of the rural sector has seen some of its toughest seasons ever following on times of very low commodity prices and the aforementioned disastrously high interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, rural adjustment funding is up from $114 million in 1995-96 to around $124 million in 1996-97. That is a clear recognition of the government's commitment to assisting farmers to not only survive the very difficult current circumstances but also find their way forward on to a more productive, sustainable and viable future after the pounding they have taken in recent years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have just announced a major review of the rural assistance scheme and I have said a few things about possible future directions. I do not intend to comment from now on because I do not want to pre-empt the work that review team will undertake. Suffice it to say that, as minister for primary industry and as part of a government which shares my views in this regard, I am determined to do everything I can to help as many of our farm families as possible survive this downturn and return as quickly as possible to a genuinely attractive economic and lifestyle basis in the future. It is of critical importance to not just those directly involved but also the nation that we achieve that objective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have found another $14.6 million to strengthen the northern Australia quarantine service. That is a very important part of what the government recognises is a community responsibility&mdash;to secure our barriers against incursions of foreign pests and diseases to the greatest extent possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a vexed issue for Australia in the 1990s. We are a trading nation. The volume and the diversity of trade in and out of the country is exploding. The number of people who come into the country&mdash;Australians returning from abroad and visitors to our country as tourists&mdash;is exploding every year. Increasingly, the question of quarantine is a difficult one. The Nairn review is about to make a full report on our quarantine arrangements and the government will respond to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that in due time. In the meantime, we have moved to very significantly upgrade our barrier protection in northern Australia, particularly in light of the sensitivity surrounding the papaya fruit fly incursion of last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a point I want to make here in relation to supermarket to Asia, which represents the government's very deep commitment to expanding our trade opportunities in Asia. During this decade it is estimated that the increase in consumer spending on food and fibre in Australia will be of the order of $6 billion. In other words, our domestic markets from our agricultural products will increase by about $6 billion. During the same period in Asia, they will increase by about $US160 billion&mdash;an astonishing figure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we learnt in this place yesterday, Australia has not been achieving its potential in that regard. The policies of the previous government&mdash;they failed to register the great key to any country's export performance as being tied to its being competitive at home&mdash;meant that, although those markets in Asia are expanding, we have been losing market share. Our supermarket to Asia strategy is a very carefully designed and constructed strategy which will see business and government pulling together and cooperating to identify the obstacles and bottlenecks, wherever they are inhibiting our trade performance in Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As part of that, I want to touch on this quarantine arrangement because we have provided $2 million for market access expertise, which will be provided through AQIS. It is the positive side that we really have to look to in terms of this very vexed issue of imports. I do want to say&mdash;I say with real feeling&mdash;that I understand why Australians feel concerned about what appear to be increasing volumes of imported foodstuffs and what have you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can understand when people look at the grocery shelves and see imported product that they sometimes feel concerned. With such issues as imported salmon and so forth&mdash;the subject of much interest in recent times&mdash;I can understand and appreciate why people would initially have real concern about it. Under the previous government, Australia <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4437"> embarked upon a course of trade liberalisation and this government, in opposition, supported that approach&mdash;we continue to support it. What we have to recognise is that we have to get on the positive side of this and that there are tremendous opportunities opening up to us. The Minister for Trade, the Hon. Tim Fischer, is present in the gallery. He has a great long list of opportunities that have opened, or will shortly open, up to us, particularly in Asia, because of the emergence and the now following through of the new trade opportunities under the World Trade Organisation rules.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to potential exporters that we now have the capacity for you, through supermarket to Asia and through the export market facilitation scheme&mdash;the expertise thing&mdash;to be assisted as you seek access to new markets. That access has vastly improved and the expertise and technical backup are there. We need to look to the opportunities, remembering always that as a nation that exports five times as much agricultural product as we import the only thing we have to fear is a lack of competitiveness. The defence for Australia against imports is to be truly competitive; the opportunities are to do it better than anybody else, and the market opportunities in Asia are absolutely limitless. It is a permanent slight against the previous government that we ever got to a situation&mdash;I see the member for Dawson (Mrs De&hyphen;Anne Kelly) here&mdash;where American beef came into this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here we are, the world's major exporter of beef. It is not necessary for us to apply quotas or tariffs. We cannot anyway when we are exporting all of our product over there. But it should never have been allowed to arise, simply because we ought to be far more competitive&mdash;and we can be and we should be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have invested in some very significant areas. Dollar for dollar, rural research remains because there is an enormous community which will benefit from those projects. I think it is one of the best models in existence in the whole of the Western world today. We have invested heavily in conservation&mdash;$58.4 million for 1,100 continuing and new landcare <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> projects; more focus on catchment and regional action, enhanced planning skills of land&hyphen;holders, enhanced farm skills; $7.9 million for the national property management campaign; $98 million for the forest industry structural adjustment package; $32 million to the wood and paper industry strategy; and $48.6 million to regional forest agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have just heard a lot of nonsense from a couple of people on the other side who really cannot agree on very much about our forest policy. But there is the commitment that they said we lacked, the regional forest agreement&mdash;48 million reasons, in dollars.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was interesting to listen to the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia, the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson)&mdash;after the performance of his leader today, the fellow who should be the leader of the National Party&mdash;addressing the House tonight on the budget because this is a budget that attacks and hurts ordinary Australians. Indeed, the one group of people who will be most hurt by this are people in the bush. Rich farmers and rich miners will do well, but ordinary Australians out in the bush will be hit worse by this budget than any other people in this country&mdash;and the Deputy <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4438"> Leader of the National Party tries to tell us that's a good idea.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of his contribution he mentioned Telstra and prior to that he was talking about exports. The government has a marvellous idea with Telstra now, that is, to use Telstra to export Australian jobs&mdash;the iniquitous proposal of Telstra to relocate the information answering systems of Telstra to Manila. My goodness! Imagine people in the Philippines answering the phone by saying, `Hello, this is Manila central. What phone number do you want in Australia?' That is the government's attitude to Telstra and they want to sell it so Telstra can go and do stupid things like that. In the meantime, the services that Telstra provides in the bush will be dramatically reduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We heard the government say in its election policy speech that it was going to help farmers and businessmen in the country by having the ISDN system extended to the country. That was like one of Malcolm Fraser's election promises. It was useful until it was made redundant, and it became redundant the day after the election. So we should not hear any of this malarky from the National Party about how the bush is going to profit from this budget. There will be some people in the bush who will profit: wealthy miners, into whose pockets the government has put hundreds of millions of dollars with the diesel fuel rebate, and wealthy farmers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ordinary people in the towns and small farmers will do badly out of this budget because this budget attacks ordinary Australians. It attacks the sick, the elderly, the unemployed, students, migrants, farmers, single parents, low&hyphen;income earners, those who have jobs, those who have no jobs, and the aged. There are a few minimal cuts to the well off. They give them a little bit of a slap on the wrist so they can say, `Look, we have done something to high&hyphen;income earners.' But the reality is that the surcharge they are going to put on high&hyphen;income earners who do not have health insurance is really frightening the life out of high&hyphen;income earners, about 85 per cent of whom have health insurance anyway! So they are going to make 15 per cent of them pay a 10 per cent surcharge, while at the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> same time cutting and cutting at the things for ordinary Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are they going to do with this money? They are going to put it straight into consolidated revenue. They are not going to do what the opposition suggested they do, which was to put this money into a fund to help the public hospital system. It does not matter what state you are in or what political party runs that state&mdash;public hospitals in this country are in a shambles. They can only get out of that shambles if the Commonwealth takes its proper role in it.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have is a public hospital system which the states have let run down and the Commonwealth must take a lead in this. What does the national government do under the Liberal Party? They want to reduce the funding to public hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen the government make significant reductions in child-care facilities. We have seen the child-care cash rebate cut by $34 million. We have seen the abolition of the operational subsidy for community based child-care schemes. What effect will that have? We have seen a different market set up here because of the ridiculous ideological approach of the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) because somebody came up to her and said, `It is terribly unfair, Minister, that we have a subsidy going into these community based programs. All those people out there running the private for profit programs don't get a subsidy, so you should take away the subsidy.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has left the subsidy with family day care, which the opposition applauds, but she has taken it off the community based child-care centres. What will the effect of that be? That will mean that persons who have children in one of these centres will have to pay $25 a week extra for a child <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4439"> under three and about $14 a week extra for a child over three. That is just ridiculous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government says that they want to increase the participation rate. They want women to have meaningful jobs. We hear the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) every day trying to tell us that if we pass the industrial relations bill we will somehow by sacking people be able to create more jobs for women. It has eluded most commentators in the country how that will happen, but that is what the Minister for Industrial Relations says. Even if they are going to create more jobs for women, they are going to charge them more for child care. We get this ridiculous circular argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the government that said at the last election that they were not going to change any of the Labor government's programs. That is another promise broken. Not even the extra day places, which we promised as a government, will become available between now and the year 2000. They just will not happen. You will not get these places from this government. The changes to child&hyphen;care benefits will devastate the quality of care for young children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been getting a lot of letters in my electorate office from people who have been dramatically affected by these changes. Single parents especially stand to be affected badly. For instance, Karen Shaw, a working single parent in my electorate, has a three&hyphen;year&hyphen;old child in long day care. This woman wants to be a very productive member of our society. She has gone back to university and studied hard. She has a double masters degree and wants to contribute to the work force but the cost of child care will make that marginal for her. I think that is ridiculous. She wants to get out there into the work force and have a productive career, but these increased costs mean that that becomes a harder choice for her. That might be what the Prime Minister wants. Maybe he wants to tax people back into the homes; I don't know. Maybe this is a secret agenda. It could be. John Howard would like to think that we should go back to the 1950s, and maybe this is the way he sees that he can do that.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a number of child&hyphen;care centres in my electorate. One is run by the Hurstville Council. It is not a Labor controlled council. The mayor is a member of the Liberal Party, as are a number of the aldermen. They are terribly concerned about these changes. They have a centre that caters for 40 children. They have 263 children on the waiting list. With this program they will not be able to expand this centre. It means that people in the Hurstville municipality will have to wait even longer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been to rallies organised by the St George Advocates for Children. It is not some Labor Party front; it is run by Marie Ficarra, a Liberal Party member in the New South Wales parliament and the Liberal mayor of Hurstville. They are trenchant in their criticism of what this government has done for child-care facilities in the Hurstville municipality, which covers Ms Ficarra's state electorate and my federal electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been to a meeting at Earlwood which was run not by a lot of Labor people; it was run by women. With two days' notice over 300 people attended to complain about this. These are not people who are traditional Labor voters. These are just worried women who see that what this government is doing is putting at risk the chance they have to contribute in the community in the way that they would want. What does the Howard government think about that? Nothing. These people probably have to suffer because they live in an electorate that has a Labor Party member as their local member.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are sensible people. They do not want to hurt anyone. They do not want to harm anyone. At a meeting they went to it was suggested that they might demonstrate outside Mr Howard's expensive Sydney residence that we the taxpayers own. But they said, `No, the Prime Minister's wife is not well; we shouldn't go and do that.' They want to be decent people. But they are not being treated decently by this government at all.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth dental program was abolished in my electorate. Seventy per cent of the people who use the Canterbury dental clinic are pensioners. I happen to think that was one of the great innovations of the previous Labor government because it gave people a chance to go to the dentist to have their teeth fixed rather than having them pulled out. Unfortunately, one of the terrible things that used to happen to old people in Australia was that if they could not afford to go to the dentist, they went once and had their teeth pulled out. We put in a system where people could get proper dental care at minimal cost. I think that was a very good thing. That is something that we should have done to help the elderly in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what does the Howard government do? They say, `If you cannot afford to go to one of the dentists that we go to, that is just bad luck for you. Take your teeth out.' They think that is how you help the elderly. Last year the Canterbury dental clinic gave out over 2,000 vouchers for emergency dental care to people who normally would not be able to go to the dentist.</PARA>

He is 83 and still has his teeth, and he thinks that is pretty good. It is pretty good; it is an achievement. But these people now cannot afford dental care. Because they cannot afford it, they will not be able to go into the dental program that the Commonwealth government was subsidising, and they will be in real strife.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to know what the government has to say to those people. They will have to find $168 a year to buy themselves basic dental cover. If you are a pensioner, finding $168 a year is not an easy thing to do. But <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> then again, ministers who are earning $150,000 a year probably do not think of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I asked the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) in question time a few weeks ago how he could justify this unconscionable attack on pensioners in my electorate. How do I tell people like Henry Wicks that they had better not go and get another Costello cavity because if they do they will have to find the money to pay for a dentist themselves? You and I know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that pensioners do not have that sort of money. That sort of attack on older Australians is just not fair. The government says that they are spreading the pain; they are certainly spreading the pain to people who can less afford this care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen the same sort of attack on older people through the nursing home entry fee. For the last few weeks we have seen in this House the Minister for Family Services obfuscating every day on the question whether you will have to pay a charge. Today she said that the government will not levy a charge and that it will be up to people who own these nursing homes to say whether there will be a charge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister revealed the truth. In adding to the answer from this incompetent and inept minister a few weeks ago, the Prime Minister let the cat out of the bag. He said that if you have not owned a home in the last two years you will not be required to make a contribution. The other side of that coin is that if you have owned a home you will be required to make a contribution. What is the contribution? It is at least $26,000 a year. Even the minister, in trying to slip&hyphen;slide round this answer today, said that she did not know, that she could not quite tell us that no-one will make you pay, but that you will have to come up with at least $13,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that if you divide the amount that the government says that they are going to raise from this nursing home program by the number of nursing home beds there are in Australia, you arrive at the figure. There is a bit of simple arithmetic involved here, and even the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser), who is at the table, could do it. He should have been the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4441"> Minister for Finance, but they gave him some other crumb&hyphen;bum job looking after Customs. If we asked him, even he would be able to tell us that if you divided one by the other you would get $26,000. You need $26,000 to get into a nursing home. That is what this government says to older people.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Sell it! The silvertailed doctor from Bradfield says, `Tell them to sell.' Terrific. This is the sort of compassion that we get from the government. That is the truth of it all. These people will have to sell. If you do not have the $26,000 and the only asset you have in your life is your house, then you will have to sell.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Family Services has just come into the House. She would not answer the question today. Maybe before we finish tonight she might tell us the answer. Minister, do they have to pay the $26,000? She is pretty silent on this, isn't she? The truth is that they have to pay. The member for Forrest, who is sitting next to you, will do the sum for you, Minister. He will tell you that when you divide one by the other it comes out as $26,000, and that is what it will cost to get into a nursing home. If people do not own any other asset except their house, they will have to sell it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Jean Young is a woman in my electorate who lives in Earlwood. If the minister says that I am telling a fib, she can ring Jean Young tomorrow and tell her not to worry. I would like to be able to say to Jean Young that she should not worry. She contacted me in despair about the nursing home entrance fees. Mrs Young is 86 and her husband is 84. They have no family to look after them, and her husband will soon have to go into a nursing home as he is having difficulties caring for himself and walking. She asked me what will happen if her husband goes into a nursing home. She said, `God forbid! I don't <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> want to go into a nursing home, and I do not want to sell my house. What will happen to me?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, Minister, tell me the truth. Does she have to pay? Tell the truth, Minister. It is a simple yes or no answer. The truth is that you know she has to pay. You are the one who decided the scheme and sillily let it go through without keeping a good eye on it. These people are going to have to pay $26,000, and if the only asset you have is your own home, you are going to have to sell it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is where their memories are. People who own their own homes in electorates like mine&mdash;in Earlwood, Kingsgrove, Campsie and places like that&mdash;have been living in them for 50 and 60 years. These are not just fly&hyphen;by&hyphen;nighters; these are people who went through the Depression, went to the war and defended this country. Now they are being told in their 80s that if they get sick and have to go into a nursing home they have to cough up $26,000 and that if the only asset they have is their house&mdash;sell it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tell us it is not true, Minister. Tell us that they will not have to sell their house. Yes, she is pretty quiet on that, isn't she? You were pretty good at interjecting before, but when you have to answer the question, `Do they have to sell their house, do they have to find the $26,000?' you are pretty quiet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Maybe they will get it out of fresh air. They could get lucky, Minister. You are right&mdash;they might win the lottery. That is the only other way that they will find this money. In the House today the Deputy Prime Minister agreed that they are even going to make TPIs pay the $26,000. They are people who went to the war and became damaged for the rest of their lives. So what do we say to them?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year we had the Australia Remembers program. We all went to those functions. We all said to the old diggers, `What a great job <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4442"> you've done for Australia.' I was born the year the war ended. I feel a great debt to those people because they kept my country as a country for me to grow up in. What do we say to them in 1996 when they are in their 80s? They are TPIs. They are people who get a special pension from the government because they were injured in the war. We say to them, `Bad luck, Sport. You went through the Depression. You fought for your country. You are a TPI. You are now suffering and you've got to go into a nursing home, so cough up $26,000.' But they say, `All I've got, Leo, is my house.' `Sell it' is the government's answer to this statement. If there is an issue that points to the absolute callousness of this budget, it is that issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has also made cuts in lots of other areas. They have gone and said to people who receive services through the home and community care program&mdash;a program that I am proud to say I had a lot to do with in setting it up under the Labor government in the early 1980s&mdash;`You're going to have to pay an extra $6.30 a week to receive those services.' I suppose they will say, `The economics aren't too bad now. If I've got to find $26,000 to get in a nursing home, I can sell my house, but maybe I've got to find that $6.30 from somewhere because I can't afford the other option.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget is a disgrace. It attacks ordinary Australians. It attacks the most vulnerable. It is the most vicious budget we have seen in this country in 20 years. Malcolm Fraser was a gentleman and a scholar compared to the people running this government. Malcolm Fraser at least had that patrician view that you should not belt the needy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It would be a very enjoyable task this afternoon to debate some of the points that were raised by the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay), but I do have an agenda in terms of Appropriation Bill (No. 1). I would like to remind the honourable member for Watson while he is still in the chamber, before he scurries out, what the Labor Party left behind. They gave us a foreign debt of $180 billion. Labor may have gone, but the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> debt is still here. We pay for it through higher taxes and higher interest rates and our children will still be paying for it unless we do something about it now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year, Labor spent $10 billion of taxpayers' money as interest on government debt both here and overseas. Without a plan to meet our debts, that interest bill will get bigger and bigger. Paul Keating said that his budget brought home the bacon. This budget brings home the truth about 13 years of Labor excesses&mdash;13 years of foreign debt, not local jobs, and standing up for special interests, not for families and not for small business. The Labor Party spent money they did not have and they kept on spending, leaving us with a budget deficit of $8 billion. I could debate the other points he raised in terms of family services and health, but I am quite sure that the relevant ministers, in responding to the debate on the appropriation bills, will cover the points raised by the honourable member.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I rise in support of Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1996, introduced by the Treasurer (Mr Costello). First of all, I would like to congratulate the Treasurer. The coalition government's first budget is particularly good, especially after the terrible financial mess the coalition inherited after 2 March.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget has excellent news for middle Australia as it has a solid platform from which Australians can work towards a better Australia. It is quite an equitable budget for all Australians, in particular for territorians. It is a good budget for rural Australia. It is a good budget for regional Australia. This responsible budget has been long overdue and will set Australia's economy back on course as it provides a solid base for economic growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under Labor, Australia experienced Keating's recession&mdash;the one which Australia had to have. Despite 13 years, or 20 quarters, we still have not fully recovered from the recession we had to have. It was the one that drove Australia into the worst economic downturn faced in 60 years, the one which saw unemployment peak to the worst figures seen in this country since the Great Depression of the 1930s.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4443">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unemployment peaked at 11.2 per cent in December 1992 under Labor. Nearly one million Australians were out of work under Labor. Youth unemployment rose to a national average of 26 per cent under Labor. Some one million Australians lived in poverty with 600,000 of those being children, 14 years and younger, and this was confirmed by the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling in their May 1995 figures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today, the Australian community is left with a $10.3 billion black hole. Because of this deficit, we all have to tighten our purse strings. If it were not for the Beazley bankcard bill, which put Australia deeper and deeper into debt over 13 long years, we would not be facing such a difficult task.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian community has been left with this terrible legacy by the former Labor government. It  has had to be addressed. The Treasurer and the government have addressed it. To its credit, the coalition government has not tackled the problem in the usual cop-out manner adopted by our predecessors of simply raising taxes. At the 1993 federal election, the Keating government promised not to raise or introduce new taxes. To quote John Dawkins, the then Treasurer: `There will be reductions in expenditure and there will be no increase in taxes.' We all know what happened when they were re-elected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the appropriation bills a rather different approach has been taken by the coalition government. The government has trimmed the expenditure of government agencies and departments. This has been done without a doubt in a responsible and equitable manner. I remind all honourable members that this approach was foreshadowed during the election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Overall, the Northern Territory did not fare too badly. For example, we were the only state or territory to receive a special revenue assistance grant in this budget. Other areas in which the Northern Territory benefited relate to the commitment to defence in the Northern Territory, which has been not only maintained but also increased. In brief, the Northern Territory has also won in areas such as national landcare program grants, and the Northern Development Council is to be re- <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> established and funded. Also, the Darwin based Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Australian Television received a boost to its funding of $6.4 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe this is a good budget. It is a fair budget. Overall, I believe the Northern Territory has done well considering the outstanding Beazley bankcard account. Territorians understand the problems the government has faced. Taking that into consideration, the budget is fair and territorians should be satisfied with the final outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To reinforce this, I thought it might be worth while mentioning what the Northern Territory Chief Minister, Shane Stone, said in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly in response to the handing down in August of this federal budget. He said that it is a fair budget, that it will assist middle Australia, and that it is a budget that will help territory families, and he congratulated the Prime Minister. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . our Coalition colleagues in the Federal Government have gone about redressing Labor's mistakes by reducing expenditure rather than by increasing taxation, that is good news for all Australians. The average family out there in the Territory is going to do very well out of this Coalition Budget. We have had to pay the price, but we are doing it responsibly. We are doing it by reduction on expenditure and not by increasing taxation. John Howard is to be congratulated for that.</PARA>
<PARA>Getting back to the details of the budget and its benefits to the Northern Territory, the Northern Territory won in many areas as a result of the coalition's budget. In particular, the Northern Territory benefited in respect of defence, tourism, the diesel fuel rebate, the development import finance facility, the national landcare program and indigenous funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of defence, I am particularly happy to see that there will be a further development of defence facilities in the Northern Territory. The development package is valued at $97 million for this financial year. This means that this year there will be an injection into the Northern Territory of around an extra $2 million each week. With such a strong commitment being shown to defence by the government, this should and will be maintained in the future. The federal <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4444"> budget allocated $484 million to major capital facilities for defence nationwide and the Northern Territory has been allocated more than one&hyphen;fifth of that total amount, showing territorians a true commitment from this government to the north and its development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was also pleasing to see that the export market development grants scheme has been retained. Small and medium sized businesses will be targeted with increased access for the tourist industry. The coalition government recognises the tourist industry's export potential, and increased the rate of the grant from the previous 25c to 50c in the dollar. An amount of $10 million over the next two years will be spent on a national program to provide incentives to the development of new tourism projects and facilities in rural and regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of the measures announced in the budget and its increased focus on small and medium sized businesses that are exporting in the region will ensure that territory companies will be able to expand and thus increase employment opportunities in the Top End. Considering that tourism is one of our main industries, that is good news.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has shown its commitment to regional Australia with the maintenance of the diesel fuel rebate. This will benefit the mining, tourism and agricultural sectors. With these sectors playing a large part in the territory's economy and our development, this is good news and an astute decision made by the coalition government. There was a lot of speculation and misinformation being spread before the announcement that the diesel fuel rebate scheme would be maintained. I understand that the government will tighten the eligibility criteria for this scheme. However, keeping in line with the government's commitment to regional Australia, it was retained, and the speculation proved to be premature.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although the development import finance facility program has been changed, I was very happy to hear that the concerns about the territory's Integrated Technical Services company were allayed. ITS is the partner and technical adviser to the solar power company Australia Solarex Pty Ltd. It had been proposed that the coalition government would not <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> meet all of its DIFF commitments. To my knowledge, the coalition government is certainly meeting its commitment to Integrated Technical Services and Australia Solarex Pty Ltd which will help provide power supplies to remote areas of eastern Indonesia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also welcoming to see the government's commitment to continue assistance to the 49 national landcare projects in the Northern Territory. The funding totals about $2&half; million, and some of the major beneficiaries are land councils, Aboriginal councils and regional communities. The continuance of the national landcare program also demonstrates a major coalition commitment to rural Australia and, through these programs, the aim is to secure the long-term productivity and ecologically sustainable use of our natural resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another fine example of the territory doing well in terms of budget savings is the funding of certain programs for Aboriginal Australians that have been quarantined from any budget cuts. Aboriginals represent a large portion of the Northern Territory population; in fact, they represent about 25 per cent of the total population. Aboriginal youth and families will benefit from the federal government's decision to save health, housing and employment programs from budget cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The community development employment project, CDEP&mdash;otherwise known as the work for the dole scheme&mdash;has greatly reduced Aboriginal unemployment and given back to Aborigines their self-respect and self-esteem. It has also helped build much needed infrastructure such as roads, water and housing in remote communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has quarantined the health infrastructure priority projects, HIPP, and the community health infrastructure priority projects, CHIPP, from budget savings. The coalition is honouring its commitment to improve the outcomes for indigenous Australians, and I am pleased to see that these programs have been maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our predecessors ignored the situation for far too long, and indigenous Australia has been left with a shocking legacy. After those 13 long years of Labor government, living conditions in Aboriginal communities have <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4445"> not improved and, in some cases, have actually become worse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth is also committed to spending a further $428 million over the next four years on specific indigenous programs. The programs' total Commonwealth funding for the next financial year will be $1.6 billion, which is the second highest on record. Our predecessor spent less in its last four years than this government plans to spend in its first four. The coalition government has handed down a fair and reasonable budget for indigenous Australia, and it has given top priority to maintaining the health, housing, employment and education needs of Aboriginals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition government has also brought in initiatives for general practitioners and specialists to support rural town services. The coalition is promoting and supporting the development of rural infrastructure and training of rural doctors. I know for a fact that, since the coalition government was elected, the territory has received many boosts to funding in health and aged care in remote areas. Under the family services portfolio, the territory has received funding to meet the needs of older territorians and to promote healthy ageing for Aboriginals and ethnic rural and remote territorians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 13 years of neglect of rural health issues is finally being addressed, and I for one am happy to see that this government is caring for those who live in remote areas such as the communities throughout the territory. The coalition government is not only a fair government but also a caring one. With regard to health in general, it is excellent to see the coalition putting in place initiatives such as the $1.5 billion private health insurance incentive. Who can forget when Labor's top paid politicians, such as Paul Keating and Carmen Lawrence, bragged that they did not take out private cover but relied solely on Medicare? Under Labor, private health cover declined by 33.6 per cent. The coalition government is setting about addressing that situation with the implementation of the private health insurance incentives whereby top earners and others will be encouraged to take out health insurance.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition government has handed down a fair budget, one which is aimed at benefiting the whole of the Australian community, not just a privileged few. The government is committed to achieving tangible results, not just empty rhetoric, as was the case with our predecessors. One year ago the international financial markets judged Australia as a risk. They required a risk premium on 10&hyphen;year bonds of 2.2 per cent. That meant Australian 10&hyphen;year bonds had a 2.2 per cent higher risk rate than the United States. Since the election the risk premium has come down by one per cent to 1.2 per cent. Why? Largely because the coalition government's budget delivered what we said it would.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is working at getting the Australian government's finances in order. Our predecessors left Australia with a massive debt of $10.3 billion, one which the coalition government is committed to fixing. However, we will fix it in a far more accountable manner, and I know for a fact that we will not be shying away from the task that was left to us by our misguided counterparts. The Australian people wanted a change. They wanted someone who would govern the country in an accountable and sensible way. They wanted someone who would get on with the job. This budget certainly shows that the coalition government will be doing that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I reiterate that I commend the government for its fair and sound budget, taking into account the $10.3 billion deficit left behind by the former Labor government. However, I must say that I hope to see some financial commitment from the Commonwealth next year for one of the most important things for the territory: that is, the Darwin to Alice Springs railway. I know there may be some initial financial outlay, which is difficult in this tough economic climate, but the long-term benefits to Australia and the Northern Territory economy would be enormous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to comment on a couple of points made by the honourable member for Watson. He said that the budget was for the privileged. I believe that it is a battler's budget. It is a battler's budget because it is about keeping interest rates down, which is most important. The budget is also about <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4446"> helping small business. If small business is stimulated, the economy will also be stimulated. Somebody said during the election campaign that if every small business in Australia employed one additional person there would be no unemployment. I believe that once the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) gets his unfair dismissal legislation through the Senate that will help everyone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no nice way to recover a deficit of nearly $10 billion. The headlines in the media during the budget deliberations were very solidly in favour of the coalition's direction. The Labor Party is certainly not taking into consideration the direction that the government is taking. They were the ones that made the decisions over the past 13 years that resulted in the financial situation this country faces today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a strong and fair budget, and I believe it will keep faith with the families. This coalition budget is about giving the Australian community a fair go. They know what kind of mess the economy is in. They know when they get their bankcard statement at the end of the month they have to pay it. Unfortunately, over the last 13 years the bankcard statement for Australia has never been paid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need strong medicine now. I know that some people in some sections of the community are going to complain, but I do not believe that any sections of the community should be quarantined from the measures that the coalition government is taking to try to get this country back on its feet. This budget is good news for the Australian community. I congratulate the Treasurer for bringing down the coalition's first budget in 13 years.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This first Howard&hyphen;Costello government budget does, at last, show the coalition putting into practice what it really believes in. This is the National Commission of Audit, the coalition's primer and Fightback III package, in operation. The National Commission of Audit is the blueprint for the Howard years, and it provides the essential rationale, the actual focus and modus operandi, for the economic brigandage and social dislocation which are <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> embodied in the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1996-97.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a budget of mindless negation. This is a budget of flippant destructiveness. This is a budget of supply side obsessions. This is a budget driven by the nihilistic ideological urge that lies at the heart of the coalition's philosophy: the urge to destroy a strong, central, unified federal government's involvement in the affairs of the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition wants to remake Australia in its own federally&hyphen;fractured image of itself. This coalition budget is the first step towards dismantling and dismembering the federal government and driving Australia back into a pre&hyphen;federation straitjacket of inconsequence and irrelevance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition firmly believes in the primacy of the states and the redeployment of any federal government programs or activities to those states. The coalition would return the Commonwealth to its position in 1901, when it only had a tripod of powers over posts, telegraphs, defence, customs and excise. The coalition would go further than this by handing over ownership and control of communications, and any other added areas of responsibility it can, to the private sector. The coalition's revolution is entirely minimalist. It seeks to destroy rather than build; it seeks to divide rather than cohere; and it seeks to diminish rather than enlarge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This first Howard-Costello budget is but the first step in the coalition's march towards a diminished, divided and dissolved Commonwealth government of Australia. This budget is nothing less than a vigorous and concerted attack on the whole notion of Australia as a unified country preparing itself for a greater role in the economic affairs of the region and the world in the 21st century. This budget is directed at butchering this continent as one creative working nation and turning Australia into the dismembered nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget stands in stark contrast to the then opposition's deceptive presentation of itself as believing wholeheartedly in an entirely different approach to what it meant to be in government. This budget is the real coalition and not the pretend lot that we had before the last election. This budget is entirely <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4447"> consistent with the coalition's philosophical underpinnings, its view of the world, its view of this country and its understanding of the role of the federal government in Australian society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This first Howard-Costello budget is merely the precursor of their future efforts, which will be directed towards a total reshaping of Australia as we now know it. Embedded in a 19th century understanding of the world, the coalition will attempt to refashion Australia into as anachronistic an entity as the coalition itself. This will result in the destruction of a strong, central, engaged federal government and the unity, purpose and sense of direction of continental Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This first coalition budget seeks to hack and slash, cut and trim, burn and bury quality programs of real assistance to the people, businesses and regions of Australia. For all the asinine braying of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the pompous bleatings of mock outrage from the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), retailing their supposed reasons for undertaking the dismantling of major programs, the simple stark reality is that this budget carves Labor programs to pieces and supplants them with the coalition's electorally-driven titbits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This replacement process has been trumpeted by the Treasurer as taking place in the most transparent set of budget documents ever produced. In fact, these budget papers and the associated materials produced by various ministers' officers are the most opaque presentation of the budget in the history of the Commonwealth. The actual budget savings measures were almost impossible to identify because the government chose not to be up-front, direct, open and honest in the papers or the associated press releases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason is not difficult to identify. The coalition did not want the media to be full of the actual details of all the cuts, because the public could then have been fully informed of the dramatic range and depth of the savings measures. The coalition thought it was politically smarter to either bury the information or simply not release it. Those sections of the public affected by the measures would only become aware of their direct impact over time <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> as they were confronted with the increased costs and charges or the simple abolition of services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This tactic made it almost impossible for the media to intelligently comment upon the real scope and impact of these measures. In the absence of hard and detailed information on the exact nature of the savings measures, the media was left to conjure with the broad outline of the figures and the coalition's rhetoric. The opacity of the papers is not confined to parliamentarians, the public at large and the media, but even to trained economists whose job it is to decipher the budget papers. A number of these economic specialists have commented that it is almost impossible to define the specific savings measures to be undertaken, because the information has simply not been provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This leads me to wonder whether the coalition government itself knows what those specific savings measures will be or whether they have just drummed the figures up on the basis of past Commonwealth government programs. Indeed, there would seem to be ample evidence for this view in the responses in question time of the Minister for Family Services, Mrs Judi Moylan, to opposition questions asking for specific details related to the savings measures propounded in the budget papers for her portfolio. The minister's recurrent, long-winded, rhetorical accounts of coalition policy did not answer the questions. That is not unusual, as coalition government ministers seem not to be given to the practice of answering the key details of opposition questions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of the Minister for Family Services, when repeatedly pressed for the detail, the minister seemed quite unable to reply. I think she just did not know the answers. Indeed, I think she still does not know because her answer in the House several weeks ago, when pressed yet again for the specifics, was simply to state that the budget figurings relied upon the costings of the former Labor government's hostels program. The obvious inference is that the minister does not know what the savings measures will be because they have not been worked out properly. They are just a guesstimate, and the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4448"> coalition will make up the actual measures as it goes along.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget has dramatically cut federal government assistance to our exporters. This is generally illustrative of the broad thrust of the budget to deal the coalition government out of the proper business of the federal government. This coalition government has mindlessly and profoundly hurt businesses that can be the powerhouse of the future Australian economy's drive into Asian and world markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were many Labor initiated programs designed to support the efforts of Australian companies in their drive for export opportunities. The export market development grants scheme is expected to save $82.3 million over the next four years by improved administration&mdash;achieved in part, no doubt, by reducing the eligibility of businesses for these grants and capping expenditure at $150 million. These measures are expected to save the budget $344.2 million over the next four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition thinks that this cut in funding is a triumph, as the lamentable Minister for Foreign Affairs, the member for Mayo (Mr Downer), no doubt thinks that the abolition of the development import finance facility program is a diplomatic and trade triumph. For our small and medium sized firms trying hard to export into Asia, the arrant brigandage of these cuts will be totally apparent. The combined slashing of the EMDG scheme and the abolition of the DIFF scheme will, in the words of the Parliamentary Research Service's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Budget Review 1996-97</EMPHASIS>, `send negative signals to both Australian exporters and our trading partners because it has been such a high profile part of Australia's efforts to develop an export culture.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> That export culture, which was nurtured by the previous Labor government, will be further diminished and constrained by the abolition of the International Trade Enhancement Scheme, the Tradeblazer Economic Commerce Project, the Australian Trading Enterprise: Japan project and the Innovative Agricultural Marketing Program. These were viable and successful schemes which enhanced the prospects of our small and medi um businesses in export trade. Their hacking and dismantling will directly affect those businesses which could have benefited from them and the export culture being encouraged by these programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Small and medium size companies need to be assisted to make a push into new markets overseas and bring back valuable export dollars. These companies have neither the resources in terms of their knowledge base or the money to pay for the costs to start up overseas. Unassisted, these small and medium enterprises will remain shackled, uncertain of how to proceed and too financially and experientially deficient to make the extremely difficult jump into an expansive exporting mode.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous Labor government's approach to assisting Australian businesses to export into Asia and the world was not a single focus program like the `supermarket to Asia' idea. Labor had a multilayered approach which understood the  diversity of industry in Australia. These Labor programs recognised that every industry has the potential to export and provide income for the nation. By restricting businesses to one or two programs, as outlined in the report of the National Commission of Audit and the budget, this coalition government has gelded opportunities for the proliferation of Australian businesses into the global economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason for these actions is nothing short of an ideological push to remould this country using ideas and policies long discredited in others. The coalition government's direction, enunciated by the National Commission of Audit, is supposed to be based on choice, competition and efficiency under the aegis of the controlling mechanism of the marketplace. Everything else&mdash;whether direct services to the Australian population at large or federal government programs and instrumentalities&mdash;is given only secondary consideration and made subject to the coalition's marketplace and price signals mentality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The federal government is not a corporation subject to hostile takeovers, acquisitions or mergers, but the coalition obviously thinks of itself as being in a receivership mode. The coalition&mdash;the grand receiver&mdash;is bent upon <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4449"> merging, if there is any discernible overlap, all disposable federal government functions and responsibilities with those of the states or local government, or is bent upon allowing federal government activities to be acquired by the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The National Commission of Audit precisely laid down the entirely minimalist guidelines for this receivership and the fire sale the coalition is conducting. The commission argued that the federal government should divest itself of all activities which were not part of its `core business', which the commission virtually defined out of existence except for a tangential monitoring and benchmarking role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The commission believes that the government should fund programs but not actually deliver any services&mdash;they should be tendered out to public or private service providers. The federal government's prime role would then simply be to maintain and monitor through, in the commission's words on page ix of the preface:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the use of benchmarking, competitive tendering, appropriate technology and cost recovery&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and by:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . setting up accountability and performance monitoring frameworks against desired outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA>For the National Commission of Audit and this coalition government, the federal government is reduced to the status of a supervisor or referee&mdash;it is not allowed to play the game because it is virtually relegated to being the sideline eye.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Government is about leadership and service. Federal government is about making one strong, unified nation and encouraging it to become economically and socially more cohesive and viable. It is not about creating six weak, divided, poor state based nations on the one continent of Australia. The federal government is not just the state's tax collector. It has had, in the past, a larger and more significant role in modernising the economy and the country, and it should continue to pursue and refine that positive interventionist role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> No better example of the coalition's vicious ideological attack on programs of real conse quence&mdash;which demonstrate the federal government's ability to effectively innovate in the area of regional economic development in cooperation with state and local governments&mdash;is to be found in the axing of the Building Better Cities program. The success of Building Better Cities Mark I led the previous Labor government to announce Building Better Cities Mark II in the 1995-96 budget. This provided for funding of $254 million over a four-year period. This substantial funding was added to by Community and Nation and enhanced by Working Nation's $150 million regional development program. According to the Parliamentary Research Service budget review for 1996-97, the bulk of this funding was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . allocated to regional strategic infrastructure and the remainder for regional economic structure, strategy and projects.</PARA>
<PARA>The core importance and the effectiveness of the efficient use of federal government funds in initiating projects, which would otherwise have never been started, is best demonstrated by the establishment of the Australian Technology Park in Redfern, Sydney. Under the direction of Dr Tom Forgan, $11 million of Building Better Cities funds were used to provide the basic infrastructure for this outstanding, perfectly located, world standard technology park. Without this funding from the Commonwealth, the Australian Technology Park would not presently exist. It would not have been built and would not be anticipating a stellar future in cutting edge research.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition does not believe in direct funding of cooperatively based regional projects. The Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) justified the slashing and abolition of such regional programs in the following terms in his press release of 17 July 1996. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Current arrangements for Regional Development and Urban management overlap with State and local Governments which have their own urban infrastructure and local Government reform programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no clear rationale or constitutional basis for Commonwealth involvement.</PARA>
<PARA>The minister for transport has lifted this straight from pages 77 and 78 of the report of the National Commission of Audit&mdash;the only <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4450"> change being a reordering of the sentences. One would have expected the minister to fully acknowledge his indebtedness to this coalition primer, but perhaps he did not want to draw attention to the direct source of the budget cuts in his portfolio. He surely could have because the National Commission of Audit, which is Fightback Mark III, is the full blooded sire of this Howard/Costello budget. The minister for transport should not have been coy about his indebtedness to the National Commission of Audit, because page after page of the budget papers directly lifts the wording of that document and its rationale, taking the government out of federal government across every portfolio area&mdash;none more so than in the infrastructure area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition government has followed the National Commission of Audit recommendations word for word but, when it comes to advice that is inconvenient, advice that does not fit in with its prejudices and advice that supports the former Labor government's innovative regional development program, it flatly refuses to take that sound advice. The McKinsey report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Supporting regional leadership: unfinished business</EMPHASIS>, was dumped into the wastebasket because it said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After only 18 months in operation, the Regional Development Program has made a significant start in rejuvenating leadership in Australia's regions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak today in support of the coalition's 1996 budget, and I speak very much against the so&hyphen;called amendment moved by the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans) and seconded by the person who wants his job, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean). Allow me to examine a few of the items listed in the amendment moved by the member for Holt. Take the first point, where he claims:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The budget betrays the Australian promise of working towards a more fair, inclusive and united society.</PARA>
<PARA>How the member for Holt could keep a straight face when making such a statement is quite beyond me. This statement is from a senior minister in a number of previous Labor governments: Labor governments that threw a million people onto the scrap heap in `the recession we had to have'; Labor governments that saw foreign debt go from $23 billion in 1983 to almost $200 million when they lost government; and Labor governments that planned for a cumulative deficit of $69 billion over their last five years. I will come back to that. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4451">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Holt was part of a Labor government that played favourites year after year, pandering to the minority groups whilst casting aside mainstream Australia. He has the hide to talk about a `fair, just, inclusive and united society'. Unfair, unjust, exclusive and divided&mdash;that is what they demonstrated in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At long last Australia has a budget that is fair, that is just and that is inclusive. And it will unite society. Despite the atrocious debt left to us by yet another financially incompetent Labor government, we have a budget that passes all these tests. The people, organisations, businesses, financial markets and community groups out there in the real world are telling us that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No matter how much the Labor opposition runs around saying, `No, no, it is all dreadful, the world's about to end,' the people are saying otherwise. They are saying, `It is about time that a government was responsible.' They are saying, `We couldn't go on living beyond our means.' They are saying, `What you have designed is fair. It is just.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The members of the Labor Party do not like it, do they, Mr Deputy Speaker? They do not like the fact that the people of Australia recognise that Labor totally mismanaged the finances of this country and that the people are thankful for the fact that, although we did not create the problem, we are prepared to take the responsibility for fixing it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me reflect on the problem which I referred to. The budget papers clearly say that, in the last five budgets brought down by the former Labor government, an accumulated deficit of $69 billion was the result&mdash;and $69 billion is just another big number, some might say, but let us look at it in context. There were budgeted deficits totalling $69 billion over five years while there was continual growth. The Labor Party likes to brag about the growth aspect in those last few years. But don't forget it was growth out of the worst recession&mdash;a depression, really&mdash;since the Great Depression. If you couldn't grow out of that, then you aren't really trying. What an unbelievable situation. We have been growing, but we were going further and further into debt.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Allow me also to make some analogies that might help honourable members fully understand the extent of this. The overall size of the annual budget is about $140 billion. Over five years this means a turnover of about $700 billion with a loss of $70 billion. If that was a small business that turned over about $1.4 million a year&mdash;that is a small business that probably employs only a few people if it is in the retail area, or it might employ up to about 20 if it is in a service area&mdash;over a five&hyphen;year period of growth this small business turns over about $7 million. If this small business had a similar budget strategy to the previous Labor government's budget strategy, it would experience a loss of $700,000. Just think about that: a business in a growth period but budgeting to lose $700,000 in five years. That includes selling off some of its assets, if it really mimics the Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How long would that business stay in business? Not very long. The banks would be moving in pretty smartly. The Labor government did not last long either, once the shareholders realised what they were doing. They knew the banks were on the way, so they put new management in place in March&mdash;management that was prepared to address the problem, management that could put in place a comprehensive plan to sort it out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There probably are not too many people on the other side of the chamber who can relate to the workings of a small business. Most only knew the workings of the Labor Party or the union movement. To help those opposite, let us look at the situation from the point of view of an individual's income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Take an average family income of around $40,000 a year, which is not particularly high. Over five years that equals a total of $200,000. If that family ran their budget like the previous government ran theirs, they would build up a debt of $20,000&mdash;an extra $20,000 on the bankcard. They probably would have sold an odd asset as well&mdash;a bit of furniture or something like that. After five years, that family would be forced to do something drastic. They would not be able to keep putting it on the bankcard. Australia cannot continue to put it on the bankcard.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4452">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is with that sort of background that this government put together the 1996 budget&mdash;a budget that turns that ever increasing debt around. Our budget is one of good financial management. It is yet another example of a coalition government having to clean up Labor's financial mess. Jeff Kennett had to do it in Victoria. Remember the rust bucket that Victoria became under Cain and Kirner? Dean Brown had to do it in South Australia. If Victoria was a rust bucket, South Australia under Labor became a mere pile of rust dust.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor governments just cannot handle money. They don't understand its value. It is simply numbers on paper to them. Labor's contribution to the debate on this budget further proves that. Opposition member after opposition member has stood up here and bleated about funding changes. In many cases, the so-called cuts are not cuts in spending compared to what was spent in previous years, but cuts compared to Labor's forward estimates from their last budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know how far out they were in that budget. It was supposed to be in surplus, but it ended up being in excess of $10 billion in deficit. What does that say about their forward estimates? They were a joke. They were merely a wish list. Labor could not have stuck to their forward estimates because they were broke. So forget about making comparisons with Labor forward estimates. It is meaningless and totally misrepresents the reality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Allow me to talk about the bleatings of those opposite, because it goes to the very heart of the philosophical differences between them and us. We saw the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) crying crocodile tears. It was the end of an era, he said. My oath it was&mdash;and thank goodness for that, say the Australian people. We had the member for Batman crying those crocodile tears about unemployment and Labor's beloved labour market program. He ruled over a union movement that sat back and allowed hundreds of thousands of workers to be thrown out of work by Labor's recession&mdash;a union movement that has contributed to an industrial relations system that has acted as the greatest disincentive to employment. We had the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> unfair dismissal laws, closed shops, sweetheart deals&mdash;all of those things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's solution to the unemployed that they created was to throw buckets of money around willy&hyphen;nilly on so-called labour market programs. I never did work out whether that was labour, L&hyphen;A&hyphen;B&hyphen;O&hyphen;U&hyphen;R or Labor, L&hyphen;A&hyphen;B&hyphen;O&hyphen;R. But I do know that, on the whole, that method did not work. It should have been part of Labor's environment policy because what it did was recycle people. In most cases&mdash;although, to give some credit, not all&mdash;it was an expensive, cynical method to fudge the books, to try to make out that things were going well. Each time an unemployed person went into one of the short&hyphen;term subsidised jobs, it was another job created as far as Labor was concerned. That is Labor's definition of job creation&mdash;welfare payments to keep someone off the unemployment list.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is where we differ. Labor's solution is a socialist solution&mdash;people controlled by the state. Our solution is to facilitate the creation of real jobs. I said it in my workplace relations speech and I will say it again here: governments don't create real jobs. Only wealth creation and investment can create real jobs. But you will not get that unless your overall economic climate is right. That is the role of the government. Get the climate right and you will see confidence grow, you will see investment, you will see growth, and you will see real jobs being created. That is the problem with those on the other side. They used up lots of our assets, they borrowed more and more, and spent it all. They spent it by throwing it at schemes that were doing precious little for long-term jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real scandal in this regard is that everyone knew just how much was being wasted. Travelling around Eden-Monaro leading up to the election, I was continually told by labour market providers that so much money was being wasted. They told me that, instead of using money in a strategic way, the Labor government was simply writing cheques to move people off an unemployment list. But the net effect was minimal. In a spending frenzy, in a desperate attempt to get the numbers down by the election, they spent 95 per cent of the year's budget for labour <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4453"> market programs in their first eight months. Those out there in the marketplace knew it was happening and they were horrified. That is the sort of irresponsibility which is not in the budget we are now debating. You will not see that sort of wastage of public moneys by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have here is a strong but fair budget for all fair&hyphen;minded Australians. The only squeals we will hear&mdash;apart from the squeals from our opponents opposite&mdash;will come from those minority and self&hyphen;interest groups that have been pandered to by the previous Labor government. The times of playing favourites are now gone and mainstream Australians will now get a fair go. Families in towns like Cooma, Bombala, Eden, Bega, Narooma, Moruya and Batemans Bay are very happy with this budget. Even before the budget, those families benefited from the interest rate cuts introduced since the coalition came to government. That has meant about $80 a month less for an average home loan repayment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the budget those same families will benefit from the $1 billion tax incentive. Families in Eden-Monaro will benefit more than those in most other electorates because there are lots of low to middle income families in Eden&hyphen;Monaro. They are the ones who will benefit most.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned earlier that much of the so-called funding cuts were in fact only cuts in relation to Labor's forward estimates, not cuts in actual spending over the past years. The opposition and a few self&hyphen;interest groups have been working hard at creating the impression that a lot less money will be spent in certain areas, when in fact the truth is very different from that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the myths that has been created since this budget was brought down relates to Aboriginal funding. We hear the figure of $400 million being thrown around as to how much less we are supposed to be spending in the area of Aboriginal affairs. Let us compare what Labor spent over its last four years in government with what we intend to spend in the next four years.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I was interrupted for the dinner break I was commenting about Aboriginal funding in the budget being somewhat of a myth; and the sorts of things that have been thrown around since the budget explaining the differences between the previous government and our own. In today's dollars&mdash;I am not playing funny games with numbers; I am working on today's dollars&mdash;Labor spent a total of $5,869.5 million in the areas of education and training, community development employment programs, housing and infrastructure, native title and other indigenous specific programs. The 1996 budget shows that we will spend a total of $6,297.1 million in the same areas. That is over $400 million more than last year. So where is the $400 million less that the opposition talks about? It is in relation to Labor's wish list, not in relation to reality. It is in relation to forward estimates that they could never meet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real change is that we are putting a greater emphasis on health, housing and training. It is then up to ATSIC as to how it manages its affairs from that point on. I suggest to Aboriginal groups&mdash;and I have a number of them in Eden-Monaro: in Queanbeyan, Batemans Bay, Wallaga Lake and Eden, just to pick some&mdash;who rely upon ATSIC for some of their funding to ask plenty of questions. They should make sure that the grassroots organisations are not missing out while larger bureaucracies continue unaffected at the top of the tree.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me take another area of seemingly great debate&mdash;that is, employment, education, training and youth affairs. The popular attack has been predominantly in two areas&mdash;higher education and labour market programs. I guess those opposite have concentrated on those two areas because they have been able to cook up some dodgy, headline grabbing figures and the media has kindly obliged them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Taking higher education first, the actual expenditure in this area in 1995-96 was $4,755 million. Those opposite would have you believe that we are going to spend less than that in 1996-97. They are wrong. We are actually going to spend $4,955.9 million&mdash; <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4454">$200.9 million more than was spent under the previous Labor government. So one might ask: what is the story? The parliamentary research service spells it out very well. In their budget review they say in relation to operating grants:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reductions are equivalent to 1% in 1997, a further 3% in 1998, and a further 1% in 1999. It should be noted that these reductions are to the forward estimates, rather than to the current grants, and that the 1997 operating grants will actually be higher than those in 1996.</PARA>
<PARA>The Labor Party are exposed again because their forward estimates, as I said before, are a joke. How can anyone give credence to those when Labor were in excess of $10 billion out in their budget? They could never have met their forward estimates. So student activists best have a look at the reality and not what their ALP organisers are brainwashing them with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I am on higher education, I might make a few comments on changes to HECS. The reaction by some people would have you believe that we have introduced up-front university fees. That is not so. Those opposite, together with a few students from the Labor clubs at universities, have claimed that the change will make it harder for students from poorer families to go to university. What a load of rubbish!  If we were introducing up-front fees, that might have some credibility, but we are not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not like it was 27 years ago, for instance, when I started university when fees had to be paid up&hyphen;front. I came from a family who could not afford to pay for me to go to university. I worked after completing school and before university and started to put enough together to pay the first term fees. Fortunately for me I had worked hard enough at school and I won a Commonwealth scholarship which paid the fees but I still had to do plenty of after&hyphen;hours work to get some money to live on. But that was all pretty much the norm in those days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we had Whitlam who said that university should be free to everyone. It then took the country some years to discover something that we all should know&mdash;that there is no such thing as a free lunch. In the process, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> however, researchers tell me that the demographics of university students did not really change during the free years, that is, there was no real increase in students from low income families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">HECS was introduced by a Labor government as a fairer system for the taxpayer, particularly those who did not go to university. Therefore, the changes in this budget simply ask those who get the benefits of a university education to pay a little more after they are finished if they choose and only when they are earning an income. It discriminates against no-one. It is fair. It is just and fair&hyphen;minded, and unselfish Australians will support it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to labour market programs, our emphasis is on targeted training. It is on apprenticeships and traineeships. It is on getting people back into real long-term jobs, not on dodgy schemes that rotate people from long-term unemployed to subsidised jobs back on to short-term unemployed. So the grandiose figures thrown around by Labor which purport to be cuts to labour market programs mean nothing. Firstly, they relate to their previous forward estimates and we already know they are a joke. Secondly, they ignore the change in emphasis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In total, expenditure in the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs&mdash;let us concentrate on these figures&mdash;will be $17.817 billion in 1996-97. In 1995-96 it was $17.52 billion. This means we are actually spending $300 million more in that department this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I run out of time, I would also like to comment that this budget has been well received by the rural producers in my electorate. Eden-Monaro produces wool, lamb, beef and dairy, amongst other things. All of these sectors have been through very hard times with drought and low prices. Those producers appreciate that we will be spending $124 million under the rural adjustment scheme in 1996-97&mdash;$9 million more than last year. They also understand that the best thing that we can do for them is to get the overall economy right. They recognise that we are doing that with this budget.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4455">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the member for Batman most eloquently put it, this budget marks the end of an era. It is the end of an era of governing only for minority groups. It is the end of an era of living beyond our means. It is the end of an era of waste. The families, the businesses, the communities of Eden-Monaro voted back in March to end the era of Labor's excesses. They knew the country could not go on in the way that it was.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They supported change to the management of the country's finances&mdash;a change that will see confidence return, a change that will see investment and with investment comes growth and then real long-term jobs. This budget sets the parameters to achieve the climate change required. It is supported in Eden-Monaro. I commend the 1996 budget to the House and reject Labor's amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

There were also announcements about shutting down offices such as the immigration office in Wollongong so that there is no-one there any more&mdash;no-one in a city like Wollongong that has over 80 different ethnic nationalities represented in the city&mdash;to deal with the sorts of problems we have in that city. All of those announcements were made in the lead-up to the budget night itself, in the weeks before it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the night of the budget the Treasurer stood up here smugly, as is his wont, to pontificate about what a fabulous budget this was and what a great government this was&mdash;littering, as we have already said, the whole of this chamber with at least 25 core broken promises and a myriad of others, hardly making a mention of any of those decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Specifically, there are a number of areas, about which I would like to tell the House to tonight, that demonstrate the extent to which these broken promises will impact in the broad community. I want to talk about those areas for which I have  responsibility with the Labor Party in this chamber&mdash;that is, veterans' affairs, sport and tourism&mdash;but I also want to make mention more generally about a couple of other areas. I will start with regional development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The interesting thing about this government is that when they went to the last election they said, `What the Labor Party stands for, so do we.' It was all `Me, too,' in a modified form. In respect of regional development they said, `We are all for regional development. We know that the regions of Australia are where the economic development takes place. It is where Australia's engine room of growth is actually located and we want to get away from capital cities.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They said that the regional development program which had been put in place was a great thing for regions. They said that regional economic development organisations were great things for Australia&mdash;they wanted to rename them because they believed that they were all tainted because `Labor' appointees had been placed on these development <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4456"> boards&mdash;and they said that the funding that was there for regional Australia would continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Upon coming to government, the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) decided that he wanted to have another look at the regional development program. What did he do? He commissioned McKinseys, well known in the business community and an organisation which I believe does a terrific job looking at issues like regional development, to carry out a review to see how effective regional economic development organisations were and to see what they were contributing to Australia's economic performance, industrial development, social development in regions and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amazing thing was, though, that the minister took the decision to give the regional development program the chop&mdash;$150 million worth of chop&mdash;before he got the McKinsey report. It came out only about a week and a half ago, yet he made the decision to chop that program well in advance of that report being received.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does that report say? It is no surprise to people like me&mdash;I happen to chair the Illawarra Regional Economic Development Organisation&mdash;that this report actually says that REDOs are doing a superb job around Australia, that they should be retained and that they should continue to receive seed funding from the federal government. Surprise, surprise! But it is too late. It is all over, red rover, for REDOs because the money is gone. The minister had taken a decision as part of the budget process in advance of receiving that advice. It is all over for the regional development program. For those contracts still in existence&mdash;fortunately, there are a couple in the Illawarra&mdash;the money is going to be paid out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister's department gave three options for regional development organisations. One, they could fold their tents; two, they could merge with state government entities; or, three, they could try to battle on as best they could with what funding was still left. Illawarra has taken the third option and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will continue to provide a real leadership role for economic development in the Illawarra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned that in my shadow ministerial responsibility areas there were significant promises made but, regrettably, significant promises broken as a result of this government coming to office on 2 March. I think it is fair to say that the disgraceful attitude adopted by the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) in question time today to my efforts simply to ask him questions about the veterans community and the effect his government's policies in the area of aged care were going to have is a classic example of overreaction and a classic example of how those policies are coming to bite this government out there in voter land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am referring to those aged care policies in respect of the income testing of recurrent subsidies in nursing homes, increases in the pharmaceutical benefit schemes and increased user charges on home and community care. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott), and now the Acting Prime Minister today, are trying to say that all of those areas, which are cross&hyphen;portfolio responsibilities, do not impact in the veterans community. That is just rubbish&mdash;plain out and out garbage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have commended the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, most recently at the National Congress of the RSL, for maintaining direct benefits for veterans. I have commended the Minister for Veterans' Affairs in a bipartisan way for not only maintaining those benefits directly to the veterans community but also for actually getting some new programs funded in this budget. I am not sure how he did it, but he did well. Commemorative activities and a couple of other promises which were made have been funded. I have said publicly, and I will continue to do so, that he did a great job in that respect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regrettably, where he has not done such a good job is fending off the attack from his ministerial colleagues in the reform of aged care&mdash;or the terminology that his colleagues use&mdash;because the $26,000 average cost to obtain a place in a nursing home, the income testing of recurrent subsidies, which will add a maximum $238 a week, the increase in the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4457"> increased user charges on home and community care, which are administered by states, will impact in the veterans community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister's office has admitted it and the Department of Veterans' Affairs has admitted it but, for some reason, when I tried to draw out aspects of that particular matter in question time this afternoon, the Acting Prime Minister attacked our side of the parliament, referring to those of us on the front bench and me in particular, I think&mdash;because I could find no interjector in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> report&mdash;as grubs. Yet here I was trying to defend the veterans community from the attack on them in this budget and to highlight to them the concerns that many of them have already shown to me as a shadow minister. And for my trouble I am called a grub by the Acting Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I am a grub by name, then a grub by nature I will be. On the one hand, if I have to go to every RSL sub&hyphen;branch in Australia and tell them about the duplicity of this government, which trumpets veterans' affairs and says what terrific things they have done in the budget for them, I will do that. In a bipartisan fashion the minister and I have gone around Australia and talked about veterans' issues on a number of occasions now; and I compliment him because I believe, as I have said before, it is a bipartisan area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the other hand, if I believe that there are aspects of this budget which warrant an attack and warrant highlighting to the veterans community where I believe they are being disadvantaged, I will make no apology for bringing those issues to the attention of the veterans community. And I will do so, and will continue to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next issue which I would like to refer to briefly is the area of sport. Last week I participated in a grievance debate in this place where I expressed my concern about the budget decision in respect of the sporting portfolio. That was reflected in the allocation of funds to the Australian Sports Commission. Over the next four years there is going to be something like a $20.5 million reduction in the amount of money which is being made available to the Australian Sports Commission. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As members in this place would know, the Australian Sports Commission is charged with the responsibility for allocating funds to sport in this country&mdash;not only for Olympic sports but for sport programs. Regrettably, the commission's hands have been tied behind their back by a government which does not see the benefit of sport, which does not see the improvements to lifestyle that come because of people being active in sport, and which does not see the benefits of teaching people a healthy lifestyle and, therefore, in the longer term reducing the amount of money that has to be expended on medical expenses and care; it has cut funding to the Australian Sports Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, rightly, the Australian Sports Commission, hamstrung as it is, said, `We have to make some hard choices. We have to fund only certain sports at the expense of others.' They took a decision that they were going to cut the vast majority of sports&mdash;make them go cold turkey with no funding from here on in. Part of that was for organisations like the Australian Schools Sports Council, the Confederation of Australian Sport&mdash;peak organisations of that nature which are charged with the responsibility of giving advice and representing the views of sporting organisations in this country. Talk about short&hyphen;sighted! And the criteria that were being used to assess whether some of these organisations warranted further funding, I think, need to be reviewed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One example which I used last week, and I briefly refer to again, is recreational fishing. On the basis of the criteria adopted by the Australian Sports Commission in terms of participants in that sport and whether or not they are registered clubs, they decided that the allocation of some $77,000 for recreational fishing for the coming year could no longer be justified, and so they have cut it out. Recreational fishing maintains that they have a minimum of in excess of 200,000&hyphen;odd registered participants. How can that, therefore, be considered by anyone as not having the required numbers of participants to warrant continued funding?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an issue which recreational fishing is taking up with the minister, and I have <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4458"> recommended that they do so. It is also an issue which they are taking up with the Australian Sports Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many other sports placed in a similar situation. But the one which stands out and which the rumours are still rife about is netball. Netball happens to be the women's sport which has the greatest participation level in this country. I do not think you can go anywhere in this country on a winter Saturday or, indeed, even during the week at night&hyphen;time indoors, and not see hundreds of females aged from about seven upwards playing netball. Yet, surprisingly, in this budget, because of decisions having to be taken by the ASC because this government has cut its funding base, there is a rumour around that they will maintain their base funding levels&mdash;at a reduced level&mdash;but they are actually going to cut the netball program out of the Australian Institute of Sport. We are only the world champions in netball! It is only the women's sport that has the greatest participation rate in this country! Yet a rumour is about that it will be cut from the AIS because it is not an Olympic sport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That begs the question, as I mentioned last week, in this consideration of the sports budget of how much emphasis is placed on our Olympic sport and how much is placed on sport for all. I have taken the view, and I always will, that we must adequately fund the elite end of town. We must adequately fund the elite sports&mdash;those that are Olympic sports. I will always stand here and promote that view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also take the view that with the year 2000 looming, the decision taken by the government to maintain the $135 million commitment to Olympic sports participation over the next four years, which after all was only an extension of the former government's policy, was the right decision. I commend the government&mdash;I am not afraid to do so, once again, in a very bipartisan manner&mdash;for introducing the maintain the momentum program and allocating about $35 million towards it. That is great; that is fantastic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> My concern is in respect of the balance that you strike between funding for Olympic sports and funding for the sport for all pro grams&mdash;things like the kids in sport program, Aussie sports, women's sport and Aboriginal sport. I take the point that in the case of Aboriginal sport, money has been made available for those programs, and that is only right too.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where the concern is in the broad sporting community, as is being brought home to me not only by people who have had their funding cut altogether but by those who have suffered reductions in funding, is how do you maintain the participation level of people if you do not have the wherewithal to sustain sport? You cannot always just say that it will rely on sponsorship and major companies to come along because, quite frankly, that just does not happen. Major companies will pick up the likes of the gold medal winners from Atlanta or some people who are in high profile sports who look good, or iron men or women or whatever it might be, but they will not pick up everybody. They will not pick up a sport and say, `We'll look after you because you haven't got any TV rights.' That is usually the major criteria as far as that is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think there is a role for government in sport. There will always be a role. It is somewhat short&hyphen;sighted for this government to cut the funding for sport for all types of programs. I am not critical of the ASC for having to take the hard decisions that they have. I am not critical of them determining that some sports should not be funded. I take the view that some should not be funded in this country. We have about 18.5 million people in Australia these days. We cannot fund every sport that exists in the place; it simply is not possible. We will not make champions in every one of those sports. Simply because half a dozen people stand up and participate in something which they might do in Europe does not necessarily mean that we have a legitimate role to play in that. But I do think it is short&hyphen;sighted of the government to actually develop this idea that in some way we should cut sports funding other than at the elite end of town.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final area in the couple of minutes I have left that I will refer to briefly&mdash;it is a subject I will be revisiting in the not too <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4459"> distant future&mdash;is in respect of tourism. The major promise which was broken there and which everybody is talking about in Queensland is in respect of the reef tax. A decision was made to impose a 500 per cent increase on the charge being levied per head on people going to the Great Barrier Reef under the guise that it is some sort of user charge and that it is environmentally sound to do so. That is nonsense. This government has decided to cut funding for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. In order to make up that shortfall they have said, `Let's increase the levy on people who are going there.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tourism operators in Queensland are going berserk&mdash;they are going ballistic&mdash;about this decision. Not only are  they going berserk but, interestingly enough, so too are the coalition members who represent the Queensland seats affected by this reef tax. The tourism operators have all come and knocked on their doors and said, `What the hell are you doing to us? You actually came to Cairns last year during the election campaign and said, `Don't worry, tourism industry, there is no problem at all. We love you; you're going to be protected and we're going to give you plenty of money and there will be no problems at all.' That was a broken promise. Straightaway they introduced a reef tax. It stands out like you would not believe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of the tourism area more generally, the Australian Tourism Commission funding and the breaking of another promise, they maintained as an opposition before coming to government that they would continue to fund the Australian Tourism Commission at the levels previously enjoyed. That simply has not happened. There has been a cut there too. Australia's peak tourism organisation is charged with the responsibility of marketing Australia as a tourist destination. I think tourism is now our major export earner. They have had their funds cut; so they can only market in certain areas of Australia. They will have to revisit themselves. The new board that has only just been established after about three or four months of inactivity because the minister sacked the old board has to come to grips with this. It is about time the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) in this place actually gave some direction and showed how we should go. Quite honestly, this budget should be rejected. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset, let me congratulate the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) for his commitment to sport. Whilst I may not have agreed with some of the content of his speech, it is easy to see his passion and commitment when he talks about sport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Treasurer (Mr Costello) for a budget that was not easy to achieve. It is a budget which has finally acted in a financially responsible manner and a budget that has been directed not just to the vocal minorities but, indeed, towards the silent majorities&mdash;in other words, to the long-term forgotten Australians. This is a budget which will work for the long-term betterment of all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a budget which also addresses the problems facing our youth&mdash;problems that can no longer be ignored. Tonight I am proud to see the gallery full of young people from Clarencetown Public School, because the future of our nation is obviously dependent on the quality and care that we provide to the young people that we have in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Youth suicide is a subject that is very sad, one which I think touches us all. At some point in time, maybe a little distant, we will all know of someone who has experienced the tragedy of youth suicide, or any suicide, in their family or in their greater family group. With youth suicide doubling in the last 10 years in a nation that has an estimated 3,000 suicides per year in the 15&hyphen; to 24&hyphen;year&hyphen;old age group&mdash;much more than the road toll figure&mdash;it is a very sad indictment of Australian society that it continues to allow this to happen. But what have they done? To be honest, nothing that amounts to much. They simply do not care. They have never cared.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take this time to bring to the attention of the House a man who has had the courage to stand up and commit his life to mix and mingle with and, more importantly, not just hear but listen to these young people&mdash;Father John of the Commonstrength Foundation in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4460"> Newcastle. He is an outstanding member of the society and a tireless worker in helping the youth of Australia. You may turn around at this point and ask what we have done to help prevent youth suicide. We have invested $19.1 million in the prevention of this sad indictment on society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last month I had the opportunity to meet with some of the youth in my local area of Port Stephens at a meeting of PEERS&mdash;prevention, encouragement, education, resource support&mdash;at the Port Stephens Council Chambers. Due credit goes to Janelle Pearce, the youth development officer at Port Stephens Council, for organising this night of poetry of youth for the children, and indeed to the workers of the PEERS program, Jenny Megson and Brett Harris.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They were working with some of the young kids that I had met&mdash;Whitey, Geordie, Wazza, Laura Porter, Sarah Manton and Cassandra Hockey. I listened to their poetry and tried to understand their problems. The difference between us and a lot of people from the other side is that we at least give the commitment to try to understand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to take some time to read some of the poetry. Whilst it may not be in the same vein as Wordsworth or others, I think that the message is a lot clearer. Geordie's poem, relating to street kids, has the title `Everything Sux!' It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Life sux, it's a drag when you are lonely and sad,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I want to be happy and glad but it makes me mad,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">when Life stuffs me around I feel like a cloud weighed down and when it twists my tears drizzle down to the ground.</PARA>
<PARA>Whitey's poem titled `Death!' reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Death is a thing we all go through,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">one day it's going to happen to me or you.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nobody knows when they're going to go,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So live your life and go with the flow.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I don't care when I'm gonna die,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">because I might be drunk or really high.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Maybe I'll get hit by a car or shot in the head,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">but it doesn't matter because I'll be dead.</PARA>
<PARA>This is very, very sad. Sarah's poem, named `My Feelings Personally', reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to run as far as I can</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I need to get away</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">but no&hyphen;body understands <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I can't run as far away</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I can't understand</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">why they treat me this way.</PARA>
<PARA>One of Sarah's poems, titled `Life', has been published in a book by PEERS called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Crying out</EMPHASIS> . The poem reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My life is a big tear</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">trying and trying to hear</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">listening to everyday life</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">of every single human being.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But there just might be,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Hopefully!!!</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We hope they have learnt</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, maybe it's just</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">everybody survives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We hope.</PARA>
<PARA>If our society took some time to listen to what the young people are saying and learned to listen to their language, to their message, we might start to understand the problems that they are experiencing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be true to say that today there are a lot more pressures in life and expectations placed upon young people. It was easier for me and my colleague the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson), sitting beside me, to set goals when we were going through school because there were opportunities at the end, opportunities that have been denied to our children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I was reading through the book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Crying out</EMPHASIS>, I turned to the foreword, and in it was a quote from my colleague the member for Lowe (Mr Zammit). He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This worthwhile project in a book of poetry published by PEERS . . . is outstanding. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4461"> </PARA>
<PARA>We need to sit and listen to these people. There is another side to this story which shows a bit of hope and a bit of enlightenment. In my role as a local member, I have been invited along to Girl Guide ceremonies. One of the things that I witnessed in those ceremonies, in particular on 6 June at East Maitland, was Emma Hunt and Kyla Douglas achieve the Baden-Powell awards. On 5 September, Marie Ann Healy, Sarah Morallis, Kylie Saxton and Janet Peters also achieved their Baden-Powell awards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are not easy awards to achieve. They require commitment and dedication not just from the participants but also from the parents to ensure that the biggest quality that is required is maintained&mdash;it is not just talent; it is stickability. Their parents indeed are to be congratulated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today we have led our youth to have a reliance on others and outside influences, such as electronic forms of media, for stimulation. In my research from getting around the electorate, I found a letter which I found quite encouraging. It puts the other side of the argument. It was an open letter to teenagers from a Children's Court magistrate. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Always we hear the plaintive cry of teenagers: "What can we do? Where can we go?"</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The answer is, go home. Wash the windows, paint the woodwork, rake the leaves, mow the lawn, scrub some floors, repair the sink, wash the car, learn to cook, build a boat, get a job, visit the sick and elderly, assist the poor, study your lessons, clean your room and when you are finished&mdash;and not tired&mdash;read a book.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your parents DO NOT owe you entertainment. Your town DOES NOT owe you recreation facilities. The world DOES NOT owe you a living. You OWE the world something. You OWE it your time and energy and your talent, so that no-one will be at war, or in poverty, or sick, or lonely again.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In plain simple words, GROW UP, stop being a cry baby, get out of your dream world, develop a backbone not a wishbone, start acting like a man or a woman.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What you are God gave you. What you become you gave God. Australia needs your help for survival. You are important and you are needed. It is too late to sit around and wait for somebody to do something some day.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some day is now and somebody is you. You be extraordinary, or we die. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>Whilst some may interpret that as being a bit over the top, it has a very strong message. There has to be balance between the two. It is not as simple as taking one side of the argument or the other. The trick is remembering that we must work together. We must remember that we are part of a family unit and that we stand for family values, but neither should we place at risk any child no matter how small the risk. What price will we pay until we hear the cries in the dark, the sullen messages from these children? What will we do until this message is heard? Also, when will they listen to the words of wisdom? It is, after all, a two&hyphen;way street.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the big questions is: how exactly do we fix this problem? One part of the solution is creating jobs, creating hope, creating opportunity. People, in particular young people, need to feel as though they belong as a part of the society, as valued members of that society. Just yesterday, and indeed last night in this House, I outlined the launch of Hunter Beyond 2000, a tourism project which seeks to put the Hunter firmly on the map of tourism not only for its wineries but also for all the gems it possesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday, and as I said last night, that project has the support of the former minister from the opposition benches, David Simmons. He is working as part of a team. Teamwork is about achieving goals. As a team, they are not just chasing the domestic market; they are chasing the overseas market using the export market development grant that our government has had the foresight to expand to the tourism industry to make it easier to sell tourism offshore. Bringing in overseas dollars will not just reduce our budget deficit but will beat the domestic dollar some 10 to one for job creation in Australia. We need to support them so they can support us in job creation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will refer to another area about which we have heard much debate today&mdash;and I am glad to see the member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) is across the chamber. One of the industries in my electorate that does employ a lot of people is the timber industry. I must raise the point that I am also very concerned about the New South Wales state Labor government. It is about to hand down its <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4462"> decision on the future of forestry in New South Wales and it has a propensity to follow in the footsteps of its federal counterparts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former member for Page, who was not so representative of his electorate of Page, who now graces the steps of state parliament as the member for Clarence, has had a Pauline conversion on the road to Macquarie Street. The man who sat back quietly and accepted the forestry assessment practice of 15 per cent, of locking up all the forests, has indeed changed his stripes. Now all of a sudden he believes in the timber industry. In the papers at least, he is standing up for the fight. But the fight is not in the papers; the fight is in the party room. I wish him well because we need to overturn it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today we have heard from the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) and the member for Burke with their views on the timber industry. They may not agree with me, but they are very narrow&hyphen;minded views without question. No wonder they lost the bush vote. Have they ever been to the bush? That is a question I posed today as I was interjecting&mdash;and I do apologise to the House for being rather rude in my interjections, but the bush is something I feel very passionate about, in particular the timber industry.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The impact of this mean spirited budget on the electorate of Scullin will be severe. The government has taken a gamble with the future of this nation, a political gamble that is based on the contention that `middle Australia'&mdash;however that is defined&mdash;does not care about unemployment. My fear is that that gamble has already failed and among the losers are my constituents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget fails to deal with the most important problem that confronts this nation&mdash;the problem of unemployment. The budget contains no hope for the jobless. It predicts that unemployment will not fall. This is a crucial point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week saw the government dissembling in its attempts to argue that unemployment will not fall unless it gets its policies through the Senate. However, based on the government's own assumptions contained in this budget, this budget provides for no fall in unemployment. At the same time, the budget rips $1.8 billion out of funding for labour market programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Understandably, many people have been attempting to comprehend the proposed labour market system without properly paying attention to the magnitude of the cuts in this area. Put simply, the most obvious effect of this massive cut is that no longer will there be a universal right of access to public assistance if you are unemployed. The effect of the cut next year will be that well over 200,000 <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> unemployed Australians who were entitled to labour market assistance will not get access to that assistance. In the electorate of Scullin, this will mean that several hundred people will miss out on a place in programs that would have given them hope of rejoining the work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a scandal&mdash;and it gets far worse when you ask who gets a place and who does not. The answer to this question, which itself raises many questions, is that services will be provided to those with `a capacity to benefit'. How will `capacity to benefit' be defined? My fear and the growing fear in the community is that, in the end, it will be the most disadvantaged who will be found to have the least capacity to benefit. In other words, they will miss out. With those innocuous words `capacity to benefit', the government has slammed the door to the future shut in the faces of hundreds of thousands of Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of the job seekers in the electorate of Scullin will presumably fall into this category. Many will be unable to enter the work force without the benefit of the programs they would have received under the previous system of labour market assistance. Let there be no mistake: we are not talking about isolated or extreme cases but about hundreds of thousands of people who will not get access to services because of the reduction of funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new system, which comes fully into effect at the end of next year, is based on profit. The combination of the profit motive and vastly reduced total resources when labour market programs are cashed out will prove disastrous for those who are most at risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has gambled that middle Australia does not care about unemployment and the unemployed. Tradition has it that they are wrong. The tradition of a strong public provider of services for the unemployed in this country was inspired by national resolve to avoid a repeat of the devastating impact of unemployment during the Great Depression. This tradition was enshrined in the creation of the Commonwealth Employment Service in 1946. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4464">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fifty years on, the community does not yet fully understand that this tradition is about to be dismantled. They do not yet fully understand that, if they or a family member lose their job, they may well be told in Senator Vanstone's brave new world, `Sorry, you have no capacity to benefit.' The more that the reality of this wanton vandalism of a major plank of social policy becomes known, the more the architects of it will pay a political price.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the electorate of Scullin, the unemployed are not the only victims of this budget. There can be no clearer example of an unjustified attack on the disadvantaged than the abolition of the Commonwealth dental health program. The former Labor government established the Commonwealth dental health program in 1994 because it recognised a tremendous need in the community that was not being met by the states, as indicated by increasing waiting lists and waiting list times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Back then, the reality was that many disadvantaged people were not receiving adequate or appropriate dental treatment when they needed it. The Commonwealth program provided emergency and preventive care that helped unemployed people, pensioners and other people with health care cards. Care was provided in partnership from public, private and community providers. Figures provided by Dental Health Services, Victoria, show there were 5,395 treatments to card holders in 1995-96 in the federal electorate of Scullin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the success of the Commonwealth dental health scheme in reducing waiting times for treatment was used by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) on budget night as an excuse for abolishing it. Does the Treasurer not realise that, without the Commonwealth program, waiting times will simply go back up? Pensioners and the disadvantaged will be back to waiting years for treatment. There can be no justification for cuts that affect people's health.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> In addition, this budget fails the first major test set by its authors&mdash;that is, honesty. This is a dishonest budget. It is dishonest at a number of levels. Firstly, it contains a litany of broken election promises. Not subtle or poorly defined promises, but clear, unequ ivocal commitments: `We will maintain levels of spending on Austudy.' But what does this budget do? It reduces expenditure on Austudy by $527 million over four years. `We will maintain expenditure on labour market programs in real terms'&mdash;but what does this budget reveal? It includes cuts in labour market programs of $1.8 billion. And on and on it goes. The list is breathtaking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People have ample cause to remember how the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) came to enjoy the nickname Honest John. The dishonesty of the budget operates at a more insidious level. It has been remarkable to hear the Prime Minister and the Treasurer prattling on about the so-called charter of budget honesty and, at the same time, claiming for these budget documents a degree of honesty and transparency that they clearly lack.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us take a couple of examples that expose the much vaunted charter of budget honesty as nothing more than hollow rhetoric. First, the example of the treatment of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, CSIRO. In the treatment of CSIRO, this budget shows these masters of creative accounting in full flight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government claims that it has recognised the importance of CSIRO&mdash;and so should any government&mdash;by increasing its funding by $115 million over four years. It claims to have more than honoured its election commitment to CSIRO. If only it were true. The other side of the ledger reveals the government's claims for what they really are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The application of the increased efficiency dividend to all science expenditure will cost CSIRO $55 million over the next four years. The new tax on executive cars will hit CSIRO with a bill of an extra $3 million. Not content with these two attacks, buried within the revenue statement of Budget Paper No. 1 is the following little gem:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CSIRO will be expected to make efficiency gains in its operations and to rationalise underutilised property and assets over the forward estimates period.</PARA>
<PARA>This rationalisation totals an additional $60 million ripped out of its budget over four years. All the new taxes and charges that the government is imposing on CSIRO total about <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4465"> $13 million more over the four years than the extra funding. But what is the community told in the budget speech? The Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am pleased to confirm tonight that the Government will honour its commitment to restore the CSIRO's baseline funding. The Government will provide an additional $150 million over the next 4 years to CSIRO.</PARA>
<PARA>This is breathtaking in its attempt to deceive. But this sort of behaviour does not end here. This is not an isolated example of the rhetoric getting away from the reality. Let us take another example. A budget fact sheet circulated by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) unequivocally and clearly states that there would be an additional $17.6 million over four years for English language training through the adult migrant education program&mdash;$17.6 million commencing the next financial year over four years for the AMEP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at Budget Paper No. 1, however, the forward estimates for migrant education over four years show a decrease of $1.1 million. Where is the extra money? The answer is that there is no extra money. There is no extra funding. It is nothing more than a shabby con trick. When the government announced a cut to the level of immigration in July, it adjusted the forward estimates for the migrant education program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, if we go to Budget Paper No. 1, page 3-87, we see the item `Reduction in migration places under the Humanitarian Programme&mdash;consequential reduction in English language education outlays.' The reduction for the current financial year is about $1 million and for the next three years it is minus $4.1 million, minus $7.1 million and minus $7.7 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By simply keeping the amount in the budget estimates roughly the same, actually down slightly from the Labor government's forward estimates, they have attempted to pass this off as an increase. In other words, slightly less money is being spent. There is not an additional $17.6 million at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> At the same time, because the government has massively increased the user charges that apply for migrant education, it is the migrants themselves who are paying to keep the fund ing at about the same level. In fact, the revenue from these increased charges&mdash;buried deep in the budget papers like the slug on CSIRO&mdash;will recoup $28 million for the government over the next four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer honourable members to Budget Paper No. 1, page 4&hyphen;6, where it says `Increased cost recovery in the adult migrant English program'. The estimated changes in revenue in the year 1996-97 will be plus $3 million. For the next three years it will be plus $7 million, plus $9 million and plus $9 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In another budget table, not identified as containing information relevant to the program in the index, you find, `Adult migrant English program property efficiencies&mdash;reduction in property operating expenses,' minus $4 million over four years. In the same table you find the line that I have already read out: minus $19.9 million over four years. These are facts that are not found in the fact sheet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So much for this much vaunted transparent document. This is obfuscation of which Dr Goebbels would be proud. So much for the charter of budget honesty: cut immigration, increase the charges for those who do get in, and call that an increase when the forward estimates show that the amount that is going to be spent is less.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the reality is that the community providers and community groups are taking the minister's fact sheet about budget measures at face value. They are expecting increased funding and are planning on that basis. Clearly, all Australians should read this budget's fine print. For this government, there is honesty and budget honesty. That is just like there are promises&mdash;core promises and non-core promises. They are new additions to the political lexicon. This government sets itself up as the paragon of virtue and integrity. The charter of budget honesty is in tatters before it has even been tabled. Honesty was the first casualty of the Howard government, but it is not the last.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is incredible that the government continually claims that the changes to the Australian industrial relations system are going to instantly lead to new employment growth. The <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4466"> evidence from Britain, the United States and New Zealand is that the terrible price of so-called labour market flexibility is great social inequality. An analysis of commentators' views on the effects of industrial relations flexibility on employment reveals one thing: even where the commentators differ in opinion, they agree that the effect is overwhelmingly negative. The conclusion is either that it has absolutely no effect on employment growth or that any new jobs that result from wage flexibility are so low paid that the gap of social inequality simply widens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, there is an army of the working poor in the United States. This is approaching some 11 million American workers. They are battling on the American minimum wage of $US4.25 an hour&mdash;the equivalent of $A5.30. Of these 11 million workers of the working poor, 40 per cent are the sole breadwinners for their families, struggling to get by with the minimum wage and the very poor social benefits afforded to them in the United States. The United States industrial relations system means that unskilled and low paid workers receive significantly less than their counterparts in any other developed nation. All evidence suggests that employers put on workers based on the expected demand for their goods, not based on relative wage levels. In fact, cuts to wage levels can dampen demand and further undermine the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is regrettable that arising from this budget there is a growing degree of anxiety. People are unsure in reality what the future holds. Notwithstanding what those who sit opposite say, that is the reality. We find that many groups that have provided community services from time to time, because they have to enter into the competitive nature of tendering for programs, have become distrustful of each other. The wide networks that have grown are disintegrating because of this competitive nature. Rather than bringing efficiency within the system, it brings inefficiencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those who find themselves doubtful of what their employment future holds are anxious. Those who have been planning new business ventures are also anxious, because it is unclear to them what the government's intentions are in encouraging the new types of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> industries that will be required within Australia to bring job growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my electorate there have been plans on the board to put together an automotive components technology park. Many businesses and local tertiary institutions have been working on this. Because of the uncertainty of the environment that has been put in place by the Commonwealth government, they are unsure of what the future holds for the plans they have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There can be no clearer evidence than this iniquitous budget that the government has failed to deliver on its promise to govern for all Australians. The budget targets the less well-off and the most needy: the sick, students, the aged, migrants, the unemployed. It contains a blunt message to all Australians: if you cannot pay, you will miss out. As the details of this budget are explored, it is becoming increasingly obvious that it represents a sustained and comprehensive attack on the fabric of our social safety net. The message is: if you cannot pay, you miss out. This is not the sort of society we want. People did not vote for this.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The budget handed down on the evening of 20 August 1996 by the first Liberal government in 13 years was heralded as a budget which delivered for all Australians. The headline in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS>  the following morning called it a `fair go budget', and to me this best describes the measures by which this Liberal government will deliver the strong economic management promised to the people of Australia before the last election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget is a fair go budget because not only are the measures taken mindful of the tough choices that come with tough economic responsibility but they are taken with a finely honed sense of social awareness that has been historically evident in coalition social policy. At the heart of coalition social policy is its concern to protect those in the midst of our Australian communities who are the most vulnerable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those who need to be reminded of the social innovations of previous coalition governments, the introduction of the old age and invalid pension, assistance for deserted <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4467"> wives, the introduction of rent assistance and the provision of additional support for low income families are but a few of the significant initiatives of social responsibility which reflect the strong commitment of the coalition government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition parties have always valued the families of our nation and in this budget have shown their strong support for the critical role that families play in the nurturing of the Australians of the future. This government recognises the costs associated with raising children and has provided positive assistance for those on low and middle incomes by the introduction of the family tax initiative. This positive measure of support for families also includes consideration of lone parent families which suffer a high incidence of poverty. In practical terms, this means that under this budget lone parent families with two children&mdash;one under five years of age&mdash;will receive $34.64 a fortnight. It should be noted that last year Labor's assistance to families in this situation was only $4 a fortnight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget has provided benefits for our senior Australians by keeping the age pension benchmark at 25 per cent of average total male weekly earnings and indexing the pension rate twice a year. Reforms to the youth allowance and the apprenticeship training scheme testify to the real concerns this government has for our younger Australians and recognise the very real difficulties for many young people who are trying to obtain real jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new apprenticeship training scheme is an exciting innovation to allow vocational training courses to be offered by local high schools. The government will make available $167 million over the next four years to encourage local high schools to offer practical opportunities in vocational courses to students. It is envisaged that the courses will be industry based and students completing such courses will receive accreditation, which should provide positive assistance to them in gaining meaningful employment. This innovative reform of job training and education will provide a very real and practical measure in addressing youth unemployment and hinges <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> on the passage through the Senate of the workplace relations bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is fair to say that this government has, with a clear and unsullied focus, placed the welfare of families on the high side of budget priority. This concern has provided the fulcrum upon which economic responsibility has been balanced and, to its great credit, this coalition government has succeeded where Labor has failed. This is the fair go budget that Australia has been waiting for for 13 years. But Australia is still waiting. We are still waiting on the Senate. Australia is holding its breath waiting for the Senate to allow the passage of the government's legislative program which, when passed, will provide the national economy with enough muscle to tackle the national deficit head on, which will provide the best security for all of us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That this government has at its heart the support of the families of the Australian nation is one aspect of the pride that I feel in being part of John Howard's 38th parliament. In an age where relationships of all kinds are under tremendous stress, the family is certainly taking a buffeting in modern Australian society. More often than not, mothers are now forced into the workplace to help provide the family income. Their role is increasingly difficult and increasingly stressful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The role of the modern woman has changed from that of wife and mother and homemaker to include breadwinner. Even if she would choose to stay at home to be a full&hyphen;time parent for her young children, the modern woman has little choice. She sooner or later succumbs to the economic imperatives imposed by the reality of life in Australia in the late 1990s. She soon returns to the work force to help provide the family mortgage or to pay the family bills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the tenets of the feminist ethic of the sixties was the essential freedom of choice for women. However, since that time the thought often strikes me that, despite some significant gains, all women have really achieved has been the right to be eternally tired. Therefore, I soundly welcome the initiatives of the family tax package, and I am grateful that this government has the wisdom to support all women in recognition of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4468"> very real contribution they are all making to this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The government's reforms in the workplace relations bill will provide very real assistance to those in the small business sector who are best placed to employ those presently unemployed. This is an important reform initiative of the coalition government and another which is in the bottleneck of government bills waiting in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My electorate of Hughes is unusual in that it does not have a major town or city as the focus of its economic activity. There is no one locality which provides a pulsating corporate heart, as there are in other electorates. What we do have in Hughes are thousands of small businesses, many of which are family businesses. Retail proprietors in the many shopping centres of the suburbs throughout the electorate are well represented, as are small service enterprises, engineering and small manufacturing concerns. All share one thing in common, and that is an urgent need for the creation of an economic culture which understands the problems faced by small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's legislation will be instrumental in creating the kind of economic culture looked for by small business, and waiting for the Senate to deal with the very unfair dismissal laws is one of the major concerns of the small business sector. Many small businesses in my electorate have been reluctant to employ new staff due to the unfair dismissal laws of the previous government, and they are looking to the Senate to give them the green light to get going and to get serious about employing again. They, along with the rest of Australia, continue to wait and wait on the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the delivery of his speech on budget night, the  Treasurer (Mr Costello) clearly articulated the tough commitment this government gave to the Australian people. His comments bear repeating and repeating often. We need to be reminded that the previous Labor government had this country on the path of deficit and debt well into the next century. We also need to be reminded that, although the coalition government did not create the problem, the coalition government <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> has totally accepted the responsibility to fix it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This alone is a very powerful commitment from the government to the Australian people. The Australian people have been waiting far too long for a government with sufficient intestinal fortitude and an appropriately disciplined mind to make the tough political decisions necessary to deal with the deficit. However, the Australian people are still waiting to secure the strong economic benefits which will flow from those tough political decisions by the coalition. They are still waiting on the government's legislative program to be passed through the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Liberal coalition was given a mandate by the people of Australia to make those tough political decisions so that all Australians will have a more secure future. This was the mandate for all of us. So now let the eyes of Australia firmly focus on the Senate. We will wait and see how far the Democrats, the Independents and the Labor senators will go to deprive Australia of the economic benefits delivered by the coalition government on behalf of all Australians, because this was, indeed, the budget which held families in high regard and clearly delivered for all the families of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is therefore of particular concern to me that those families in my electorate of Hughes are in a peculiar position of economic uncertainty shared by no other group of families in Australia. This is because of the possibility of an airport which may be built within the proximity of their homes. As has been articulated many times since we have established government&mdash;and will, undoubtedly, continue to be articulated by our leaders into the future&mdash;this government stands up for families. It is therefore with a mind very much alive to the promises made at the last election that I draw the attention of this honourable House to the plight of the families in my electorate of Hughes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The families of my electorate are currently living with the possibility of having an airport constructed within their backyard&mdash;not just an ordinary little airport, but an international airport. This has raised great anxiety and distress amongst the families in my electorate <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4469"> and in the adjoining communities in an area which is one of the fastest growing residential areas of south&hyphen;western Sydney. The families of the suburbs of Wattle Grove, Holsworthy, Hammondville, Moorebank and Chipping Norton have already felt the impact of the proposal. The impact is not caused by aircraft noise, nor increased traffic, nor the negative impact on the neighbourhood amenity caused by the close proximity of an international airport; the impact is devastatingly financial.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The impact has caused devaluation in property values in the western end of the Hughes electorate which occurred immediately it was announced that an EIS was to be done on the Holsworthy defence area. I have been informed by constituents that some have lost up to 20 per cent of the value of their family home, which in most cases is the only real family asset. This impact has been devastating for those who have had to sell their homes in the short term. It has been devastating for those who were trying to refinance their homes or who were using their homes as collateral in a business. It is devastating for them to find that the value of their property has dropped tens of thousands of dollars overnight on the basis that Holsworthy may be considered as the site of Sydney's second international airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That tens of thousands of residents in Hughes made submissions on the EIS guidelines&mdash;as did many individuals and community groups from the area&mdash;is indicative of the very real distress and concern shown by my constituents. Their very real concern is also derived from a common awareness of the questions which surrounded the EIS for the third runway at Kingsford&hyphen;Smith airport. They share an anxiety about the time frame allowed for the Holsworthy EIS process. They are understandably concerned that the six months allowed for a project of this magnitude is insufficient and that their rights to full and comprehensive environmental protection may be in jeopardy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Proper environmental assessment and management of the EIS process is essential as this proposal will encompass the last area of significant bushland in the outer Sydney metropolitan area. This bushland includes the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Holsworthy defence area, Heathcote National Park and the Royal National Park. The environmental interests of future generations are as important as the economic needs of the present generation. You and I, Mr Deputy Speaker, are the custodian generation, and we have the precious custody of a unique area of bushland which is a wealth of remaining biodiversity. Here is an untapped resource of immeasurable benefit to the people of New South Wales. We are accountable for how we deal with it. It would be the sacrilege of the century to sell it off for 30 pieces of silver to become an international airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not all of the Holsworthy area has been affected by the defence artillery range. The Holsworthy area also holds a wilderness of remarkable beauty. The deep ravines, some deeper than 60 metres, create a topography of corrugated grandeur resplendent with the same kind of Australian bushland which provided such wonderment to Sir Joseph Banks over 200 years ago.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is Holsworthy: a secret wilderness of the Sydney Plain left almost intact from modern civilisation despite 200 years of European settlement. Six months is not sufficient time for an environmental impact study to deal fully with the collision of the 21st century upon this ancient secret wilderness. The present EIS process cannot hope to do justice to this largely unstudied natural resource within the limits of a six months time frame.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the present time, the preferred option of the government is stated to be Badgerys Creek. However, this is difficult for my constituents to understand when the two sites will be compared in the same EIS and the land at Badgerys Creek is far too small for the ultimate scale of an international airport. This conclusion makes the resurrection of Holsworthy a more risky planning decision, because picking winners&mdash;as shown by the Kingsford&hyphen;Smith third runway&mdash;is bad planning process. Rather, the `sieve analysis' planning method used in 1985, which dismissed Holsworthy early in the process, is a world recognised site selection method.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4470"> Another important issue which surrounds airports is that of noise, and this is where local knowledge of an area must be communi cated to those who will make decisions at some distance in Canberra. It is known by the people who live in the Sydney region that temperature inversions are a common occurrence, especially in summer, autumn and spring. A temperature inversion is created when a layer of colder air traps a layer of warmer air underneath. In the Sydney basin inversions are usually about 300 metres above ground level. However, Mr Deputy Speaker, I draw this to your attention because it is very significant. There is an atmospheric phenomenon at Holsworthy above the defence area where temperature inversions have been recorded as low as 50 metres above ground level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The significance of this is that a temperature inversion acts as a kind of sound amplifier. The Department of Defence is well aware of temperature inversions and, in deference to its civilian neighbours in the converging residential areas, now refrains from artillery practice on the Holsworthy artillery range when an inversion is present. The Holsworthy artillery range is part of the very same area under consideration as a site for an international airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a child living at Sylvania in the Sutherland shire, I can recall hearing the guns being fired on the artillery range at Holsworthy. All of Sutherland shire could hear the guns from Holsworthy. As a matter of fact, I am reliably informed that the guns could be heard from the Kurnell Peninsula in the north&hyphen;east, down to Helensburgh in the south, when an inversion was present over Holsworthy. I am also told that the guns could be heard in the Southern Tablelands and up around Windsor and even Hornsby, well to the north of Sydney. Now that the army has established a new protocol whereby the range is not used for firing practice when an inversion is present, the guns are hardly heard at all in the Sutherland area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Temperature inversions cannot be controlled. They cannot be turned on and off. The noise of international passenger jets doing their pre&hyphen;take&hyphen;off checks on the tarmac would be heard as a roar all over the Sydney basin. Not only will the noise of departing international passenger jets at 30&hyphen;second <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> intervals with all engines at full take&hyphen;off thrust be heard from Hornsby to Helensburgh, but also it is likely to send us all quite mad within a week. When a temperature inversion is present 50 metres above the runway on Holsworthy international airport, there will be precious little escape from aircraft noise for any man, woman and child living in the Sydney basin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In deference to this budget debate, there are the financial aspects of this project. We are talking in terms of billions of dollars when we speak of building an international airport. In the light of this government's sound budget responsibility and its readiness to take the tough decision on behalf of the future generations of Australians, I wish to express my concerns and those of my electorate regarding the fact that the financial feasibility study which will be undertaken with the EIS will be completed without any input from, or consultation with, the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One has only to look again at the experience of the Kingsford-Smith third runway. The cabinet&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence cost&hyphen;benefit analysis in 1989 for the third runway got it terribly wrong. This resulted in vast dollar costs to the public and airline industries in lost efficiency. This flawed cost analysis is in danger of repetition in Holsworthy, with an essentially confidential feasibility study. For the government, one important attraction of Holsworthy is that it already owns the land upon which the airport may be built. However, there are other important cost considerations which have an unknown inherent dynamic set to spiral costs out of control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One would think the cost of building an airport proper could be reasonably assessed from the design and construction required for its completion. Yet, historically, similar projects of like magnitude have been subject to massive cost overruns; for example, the Darling Harbour project, the Sydney Opera House and, indeed, this very honourable House itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are other issues which cannot be so clearly assessed. For one, the removal of the unexploded bombs from the artillery range, the result of over 100 years of artillery practice, defies a ballpark cost estimation. This is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4471"> because no&hyphen;one knows exactly how many unexploded bombs are out there. I am assured that modern technology developed in the Gulf War has now provided the means by which unexploded bombs may be removed. However, the cost of such removal will not be known until the last blast of the last bomb.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, the costs of removing and relocating the Defence Force must also be put into the equation. The government should also rightly consider the economic impact of the removal of Defence Force personnel upon the local business community. In my electorate alone, this proposal will directly affect 30,000 people, who are mostly hard&hyphen;working middle&hyphen; class Australians with young families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a wider area of Sydney which is also involved, including the Sutherland shire, Bankstown, Hurstville, the St George area and the south&hyphen;western districts of Liverpool, Camden, Campbelltown and Helensburgh. Some of the area's newest and most significant residential areas of Wattle Grove, Chipping Norton, Lucas Heights, Menai, Woronora Heights, Heathcote and Engadine are contiguous with the Holsworthy area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With great respect, and being mindful of the tough decisions made by our government in acceptance of full financial responsibility for the future of this nation, it is a key point that our government also has an obligation to be seen to properly manage the financial aspect of a project of this magnitude.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If our government does not see any wisdom in allowing community input into the financial feasibility study for the Holsworthy proposal, perhaps our government would allow the completed financial feasibility study to be tabled in parliament so that the elected representatives of the people may be informed of the significant costs involved.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First, the government has run up the white flag on jobs; we have seen an abject surrender in the fight against unemployment. The government has no targets.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Liberal and National parties believe that addressing the unacceptably high levels of youth unemployment must be the first priority of the next federal government.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UK6">Mr KELVIN THOMSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. But what does the budget do to reduce unemployment? Absolutely nothing. And it will simply make unemployment worse. First, the budget speech of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) barely mentions unemployment. Second, the government refuse to set targets for unemployment or for job creation. They will write to the Reserve Bank and set a target for inflation. They will set targets about small business paperwork. But do they care enough to set a target for unemployment? Not on your life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Third, if you look at the budget papers you will see that they are predicting that unemployment will still be 8&frac14; per cent next June, with no ground for optimism for any improvement thereafter. The budget papers also make <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4472"> it clear that growth under this government will not exceed 3&half; per cent and will be just 3&frac14; per cent next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To get unemployment below its present unacceptable level, growth has to be maintained at four per cent or better. That was Labor's record for the past five years. We set a target&mdash;five per cent by the year 2000. We were well on the way to meeting it, but since the Liberals got in unemployment has started to rise again&mdash;up to 8.8 per cent last week. That is not surprising.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First, the Liberal government have talked down the economy, talked down confidence, with their self-serving rhetoric about black holes and mass sackings. The chief executive of the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies put it pretty well. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On this occasion, the Howard government has allowed a very unhealthy economic climate to develop. They have created investor uncertainty by allowing public speculation to drive the debate over a considerable period.</PARA>
<PARA>He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They have promoted the view that there is an $8 billion black hole in the budget when in fact many observers are of the opinion that it is an election promise black hole which they are trying to finance.</PARA>
<PARA>Secondly, they have slashed labour market programs. Working Nation had played such a key role in getting unemployment down&mdash;in my own electorate of Wills unemployment fell from 20 per cent at the height of the recession to 10 per cent more recently&mdash;but they have taken out $1.8 billion over four years from the Working Nation programs. Thirdly, we have seen a dramatic program of public sector job slashing and job exporting. Telstra, just a few days ago, announced a $2 billion profit, yet it is going to cut jobs by over 20,000 over the course of the next three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These policies are damaging job prospects and damaging our economic recovery. What has the government got to say in defence of itself? There are two things. First, it says, `Give us our policies. Let us have our way. Let us get our way on industrial relations. Let us sell a third of Telstra. Let us get our budget through this House, through this <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> parliament, with all its broken promises. Let us get our budget through unscathed.' But let us look back at those budget papers&mdash;8.25 per cent unemployment by June next year. So we have a government which does not believe itself. It does not believe its own rhetoric&mdash;8.25 per cent by June next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, and in a sense even more sinister, as Malcolm McGregor's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> article points out that the government is reverting to the rhetoric of the Fraser era. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nothing better illustrates this return to the dole bludger stigma than the so-called dole diary. Unemployment is no longer the deliberate and personal creation of Mr P.J. Keating . . . No siree, now it is a manifestation of the mendacity of unemployed people themselves.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr McGregor says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Perhaps Senator Newman could explain to us why these epidemics of wanton idleness only occur shortly after the election of Coalition Governments.</PARA>
<PARA>So Labor's plan to get unemployment down to five per cent by the year 2000 has been abandoned and the Liberal Party has run up the white flag of surrender regarding unemployment. It has given up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Its economic strategy is quite wrong. It will run down the economy. It will slow economic growth. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Treasurer are saying, `Everything will be okay once we deal with deficit and debt. Then we can have decent community services. Then we can have decent social support.' But we will never get to that point under their policies. It will always be just out of reach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, if they do deliver a budget surplus it will go back to Liberal friends. In Victoria, Premier Kennett has now recorded a $5 billion surplus, mostly thanks to privatisations, jacking up taxes and charges, gambling revenue and so on. Now he says that that money is going to go to cutting business taxes, upgrading the Victorian Parliament House, the Albert Park grand prix, the bid for the Commonwealth Games and the like.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He attacked those who were not well off. He charged a $100 state deficit levy; there were massive increases in electricity, gas and water prices; 300 schools closed; country rail <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4473"> services closed; and hospital services were crippled. He blamed all that on Labor, but now that there is a $5 billion surplus does any of it go back to transport or to schools or to hospitals? No, it goes to friends of the Liberal Party. The same thing is going to happen here. The cuts and the hardship are to be blamed on Labor but the money saved will be spent on funding government election promises like the private health insurance rebate which is even now going straight back into the pockets of the private health insurance companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose what narks me even more than the fact that the government has surrendered in the fight against unemployment, galling though that is, and the fact that its economic strategy is the same as the failed strategy that Thatcher tried in Britain which has given that country greater levels of inequality than anywhere else in the Western world, galling though that is too, is this government's cynical regard for the battlers&mdash;those people whom the Prime Minister courted so ardently before the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does this budget do to them? We have seen the dental health program abolished, which will affect some 6,400 people in my electorate of Wills who used that program during the past financial year. The labour market programs have been cut&mdash;those programs which halved unemployment in Wills from its peak of 20 per cent to 10 per cent more recently. Community legal services have been cut by $33 million. HECS fees have risen so that the cost of tertiary education per year per student has risen from some $2,200 to over $5,000 for some courses. At the same time the repayment threshold has been lowered from $28,000 to some $21,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The child&hyphen;care operating subsidy for community child&hyphen;care centres has been cut. Parents will have to find an extra $20-odd per week per child if they are to continue sending their child to child care. Worst of all is the introduction of nursing home entry contributions. The amount of $26,000 has been suggested as an average nursing home entry contribution. For many people who will have to put their parents into nursing homes at some stage the fee will be a lot higher.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So John Howard's battlers are very unusual. They have a perfect set of teeth. They never have any problems getting a job. They never get into trouble with the law or need legal advice. They never aspire to send their kids to university. In fact, they do not even have any kids. They do not have parents either. I say to Australians out there that, if you are a perpetually healthy, fully employed, legally trained, childless bastard, you may still qualify as one of John Howard's battlers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The alternative explanation, of course, is that the Prime Minister has betrayed thousands of voters, even tens of thousands of voters, who had no inkling that he was going to cut out the dental program, cut out the labour market programs, cut the funding for legal services, jack up the HECS charges, jack up the child-care fees and introduce tens of thousands of dollars in entry contributions for nursing homes. The government has failed battlers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has also failed a lot of its own traditional constituency and supporters. We have heard a lot of talk in this budget debate about the need to support small business, a constituency the Liberal Party likes to call its own. What the government has not yet acknowledged is a growing tragedy in small business, which is suffering grievously at the hands of large businesses. Today's bankruptcy figures confirm this. Nationally, the number of bankruptcies rose by 21.8 per cent in the 1995-96 financial year, with the most dramatic rises in those states with the strongest economic growth&mdash;Western Australia and Queensland. Nowhere is the plight of small business more evident than in the large shopping centres that ring our national capitals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sad fact is that many small traders who choose to invest their time, energy and savings in large shopping centres are vulnerable to exploitation by unscrupulous retail managers who all too often seek to enrich themselves in an improper way and at the same time destroy the livelihood and lives of those honest and hardworking small business people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An increasing amount of evidence demonstrates the questionable practices at work in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4474"> Australian retailing. The number of owners and agents being taken to Queensland's Retail Shop Lease Tribunal for misrepresentation has increased by 40 per cent in just two years. Jones Lang Wootton's David Sylvester notes that the figures demonstrate an urgent need to increase professional standards, all the more so in those states which lack the Queensland process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a paper it commissioned last year, the Retailers Council of Australia found that shopping centre retailers were `easy prey' for landlords. According to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, Professor Alan Millington, who researched the issue, had a scathing view of the practices of some shopping centre landlords. The Retailers Council of Australia maintains that there is an unhealthy oligopoly or monopoly situation in Australia which provides those landlords with excessive power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In their pursuit of higher profits, some owners and operators of large shopping centres have dispensed with ethics. They do not care how their centre's competitive edge is achieved and they are happy to employ glorified standover merchants to implement their destructive policies. I want to spend a few minutes talking to the House about the deeds of some of these people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a Mr Vin Maranda, who was formerly employed by Westfield Australasia as leasing manager. In that capacity he oversaw the leasing of retail premises at Doncaster Shoppingtown. When Mia's Cafe was vacated some time ago, it was replaced by a sports store. The proprietor of this store was advised by Mr Maranda that he would need to pay some $60,000 in key money to establish his operation. That money was paid to Mr Maranda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like many retail tenants, this small trader found that his turnover was far less than what the retail manager had promised, so he approached the Westfield management and asked for a rent review, especially on the basis that he had already paid $60,000 in key money. The response from the Westfield management was that they knew nothing of the key money. It is quite likely that Vin Maranda appropriated this money, that it was <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in effect a secret commission and that it was not the first he had organised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Earlier in his career at Doncaster Shoppingtown, Vin Maranda had dealt with the Italiano family, who in mid-1990 invested approximately $120,000 in a delicatessen. An additional $100,000 was spent by the Italiano family in refitting and stock. But 18 months later, when this centre was being expanded, the delicatessen was forced to move. This necessitated the expenditure of a further $170,000 in fitting costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As an agent of the owners of the centre, Mr Maranda was obliged to disclose the owner's intentions, but all the while he was dealing with the Italiano family he concealed one vital fact: that the shopping centre was to be extensively revamped and the position they had paid so much to secure would not exist in future. Sure enough, when renovations which had not been disclosed at the time the original lease was entered into began, the Italianos were moved to another location, which was disastrous for trade. The value of their business plummeted, but the rent remained the same. They were reduced to financial ruin, their last privation being forced out of the shopping centre days before Christmas when they might have at least benefited from the traditional Christmas crowds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Maranda's exploits do not stop there. As leasing manager at Southland, he insisted on a payment of $5,000 to arrange a certain position for a seafood trader. It later turned out that he could not secure that location, but he refused to refund the $5,000. The management at Southland would probably know nothing more of this than their colleagues at Westfield knew of the $60,000 key money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Vin Maranda was quietly dismissed by Westfield after the Doncaster Shoppingtown episodes but, as far as I know, no police action has followed his dismissal. He received corrupt payments but, as far as I know, there has been no review conducted by his former employer as to the extent of his misdeeds. They might like to think he was the one bad apple. If so, they are mistaken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to acquaint the House with a Mr David Boesley, formerly the centre manager at Chadstone Shopping Centre and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4475"> thereafter the centre manager at Melbourne Central. It is a tragedy that after a lifetime of successful retailing, Nick and Val Kambouropoulos were introduced to David Boesley by a Mr Philip Akathiotis. Mr and Mrs Kambouropoulos were assured that trade at Melbourne Central was very good and that they could expect to generate up to $30,000 a week. In taking over the Terrace Restaurant, they paid $200,000 in key money and their rental was $5,000 a week. Philip Akathiotis joined their staff. Within a few weeks it become very obvious to Mr and Mrs Kambouropoulos that the trade at Melbourne Central was nothing like what had been promised. Turnover was very low, but their repeated requests for a rent review were denied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nick and Val Kambouropoulos were joined in their valiant efforts to save their investment by their three children, who gave up their three jobs to join them. After two years, the burden of high rents took its toll and in May last year the business closed. With it went the life savings of the Kambouropoulos family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Meanwhile, David Boesley signed up a new cafe proprietor in a superior position on the same floor as the Terrace Restaurant. The negotiations were done behind their backs and it came as a cruel blow to learn that the new tenant was Philip Akathiotis, who until that time had been working for them. They later learned that Mr Akathiotis was being charged one&hyphen;fifth of their rental.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Boesley, a low&hyphen;life retail manager who betrayed the confidence placed in him by a hardworking Australian family, left Melbourne Central under a cloud. But he has not departed the retailing scene. He has taken up a senior management position at Melbourne's Crown Casino. If his management style remains the same, Crown will be able to offer Victorians a unique double&mdash;you can be fleeced either as gamblers at the roulette table or as tenants in its retail complex.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that, before he departed Melbourne Central, David Boesley was making overtures to the Kambouropoulos family about moving them into the casino. I further understand that one of his new clients will be Mr Akathiotis.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Small retailers should be extremely wary of dealing with David Boesley. He has no conscience when dealing with hardworking retail tenants and will rip them off in any way he can. Members will think it curious when they consider how much of what is questionable in Victorian business finds itself linked to the Crown Casino.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you talk to small traders in these large shopping centres&mdash;for example, at Box Hill in the electorate of the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge)&mdash;you will be told that there is a system of graft and corruption at work within them. There is a system of favouritism. If a tenant wants to flourish, he or she will be well advised to bestow favours, in cash or in kind, on leasing managers. There exists in Melbourne shopping centres a practice of corrupt payments, both in cash and kind, to which owners are turning a blind eye. As long as they have a steady queue of new traders willing to replace those whom they force out through unconscionable conduct, the problem for the owners of large shopping centres simply does not exist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are not isolated incidents. They are going on all the time.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to our aged population, it is our responsibility to allow them dignity and provide them with the security they need and deserve. The budget has provided for this.

I refer, of course, to our efforts to overcome the deterioration of nursing home facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Within the framework of the budget, there was scope made available to raise the standard of nursing home facilities through capital investment. The opposition chose to interpret and run with the line that this meant a $26,000 entry fee to nursing homes. There is no set entry fee. Yet they would not let the issue drop. As late as question time today they continued to attack and engender fear in our aged population. These were and still are underhand tactics, seeking short&hyphen;term political points at the expense of our senior citizens.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There can be only $2,600 per year drawn down for a maximum period of five years. Only those who can afford an entry contribution will pay one.

The unemployed are not cattle that are to be moved from program to program to cook up the figures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian population demands real jobs&mdash;a fair day's work for a fair day's pay. A job that provides dignity and a sense of self&hyphen;worth for an individual is the vital ingredient to a happier and more productive society. The framework for the creation of such an outcome was again created by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) when he brought down the budget on 20 August. This government has demonstrated that it is responsible, that it can make the hard decisions and that it is prepared to take out the political cost of reductions in spending, because we are intent on laying solid foundations for the future generations of Australians. Every Australian knows that if you are earning $300 you cannot continue to spend $400 without coming to a financial calamity. As a responsible government, we are not prepared to borrow to pay our interest and ignore our immense debt.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4477">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Gilmore is a disadvantaged area with an enormous amount of potential. It is my overriding goal to see that it goes beyond the possibilities that it possesses. The news that HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Albatross </EMPHASIS>was to receive an injection of funding and has been earmarked for future investment was welcomed by both me and the electorate. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Albatross </EMPHASIS>is already a hive of activity. The knowledge that the government continued recognition of it as a key defence establishment has boosted the morale of its officers and men. Moreover, it provides the much needed stability and career advancement that has not previously been so assured.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These men and women are critical to the security of the nation's future. They recognise and respond to the knowledge that their role is of the utmost importance. They are also aware of the amount of money that the government and the Australian people have invested in them. We cannot afford to allow these men and women to feel insecure or uncertain about their positions. They are vital to ensuring the security of our nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I stated that my mission was to see Gilmore fulfil its full potential, and I believe the Treasurer on 20 August provided the scope for this to be achieved. Without doubt, the key element to this was the long awaited announcement of incentive for small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For too long employers, who will inevitably be the people and the organisations that absorb the massive unemployment in our area, were denied the opportunities they deserved. Their entrepreneurial spirit and financial investment were being restrained by an arrogant government. The previous administration had legislated to such an extent that the business community was aware that in such an environment the risks far outweighed the potential rewards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the keys to establishing momentum within the small business sector and the economy as a whole will be the scrapping of the unfair dismissal law. I call on those in the Senate who hold the future of the workplace relations bill in their hands to allow the abolition of this law. It must be done in order to allow businesses to take on employees and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to expand their operations, secure in the knowledge that they will not be burnt at a later date. Further to this, I must stress that fear and intimidation have no place in today's societies. The roles of the employer and the unions are changing and must continue to do so. We have to work in harmony to create jobs and wealth for all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the election this government ran on the platform that the family would be of paramount importance, and our policies would certainly reflect this. I think it gave all members on this side of the House a great sense of pride to see this commitment carried through in full. The difficulty in fulfilling this commitment was intensified primarily by the backdrop of the tight fiscal restraint made necessary by the economic mismanagement of the previous administration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The family tax initiative gave back to those who contribute the greatest to our society&mdash;the family. For too long they have been ignored. I commend both the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Treasurer for providing families in Gilmore and across the nation with the incentives and rewards that are rightfully theirs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Voters across Australia made their voices very clear on the day of the election. With their votes came a plea for accountability&mdash;accountability as to where their money was going. The Australian people realised that they could no longer afford programs that had no outcomes&mdash;programs that were only being put in place for political gain. In line with this, the people of Gilmore took great heart in seeing that some of the difficult problems afflicting our area and society in general were tackled in this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note with pride the package relating to a 100 per cent increase over three years for marriage and relationship counselling. Not only is this government committed to the strong in our society but it recognises the needs of those experiencing difficulty with the trials of life, at times through no fault of their own.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This leads me to another area, again particularly poignant for Gilmore&mdash;youth suicide. The national youth suicide strategy, recognising and emphasising the particularly acute <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4478"> nature of this problem in rural and regional Australia, is a welcome initiative. I pray that we can make inroads into this tragic situation, one that has traditionally been brushed under the carpet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An area arising from the budget for which I have received positive feedback is that of home and community care, known as HACC. This is of great importance within Gilmore. Many groups have welcomed the decision to standardise fees for services as both fair and just. The increase in funding of six per cent over four years for HACC has been seen by community groups as a well thought out approach to an ever increasing service and demand. Once again, this has been a very positive outcome from this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">May I now revert back to those who hold the balance of power in the Senate. I implore them to display leadership in allowing the sale of one-third of Telstra to go through. We were up-front with the Australian people during the election and they chose the option of implementing one of the most important environmental packages in the history of our country. I lay particular emphasis on this because Gilmore is blessed with some of the most magnificent natural gifts in the nation, the crown jewel being Jervis Bay. This package has been praised by conservationists and environmental groups throughout my electorate. We must be allowed to reap the full benefits of this momentous environmental package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Continuing in the environment vein, I commend the government on its creation of the green corps. This innovative program is particularly pertinent to Gilmore as we have many unemployed young people who would find inspiration in being able to commit themselves for a period of time to working towards the protection and betterment of our coastline and landscape. The government providing a program of this nature shows that it is truly in touch with the mood of the people of Australia, and young people will be able to gain a qualification while maintaining some of the pristine areas within the Gilmore electorate. It is an exciting and thoughtful policy. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The qualifications that participants will receive relate to landcare management, forestry plantations, heritage protection and aspects of marine biology. However, most of all it is for our youth to learn and share in our greatest asset of all, that being the aquaculture and marine based industry. We have the perfect location for what we know will be an area of growth; that is, discovering the potential for food cultivation in our oceans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There can be little doubt that the formulation of this budget was always going to be a difficult task. The previous government&mdash;and I refer to Mr Keating&mdash;showed considerable hypocrisy in the manner in which they left the finances of this nation. The Labor Party and its then `world's greatest Treasurer' boasted to Australians of his fiscal responsibility during the 1980s. However, this was abandoned once Mr Keating became Prime Minister in the early 1990s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget brought down by the Treasurer on 20 August began the clean&hyphen;up of the financial mess left behind by the previous administration. I am very proud to be part of a government that is prepared to accept its financial responsibility without abandoning its social conscience. I believe the recent budget to be the first in a series of benchmarks that this government will provide to the people of Gilmore and Australia as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I say this, I refer to both its honesty and fairness. This was reinforced by the introduction of the charter of budget honesty. The Australian people will no longer tolerate being deceived by politicians, as they were by the former Prime Minister when he told the people of Australia that the budget would be in surplus. Our charter represents the first step in re&hyphen;establishing this trust that the population should have in their representatives in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a new breed of politicians in this parliament. We may not always be politically correct, but we do believe in honesty and integrity. It is my ultimate goal to see both sides of the House take a more bipartisan approach to issues of national importance, and the economy is a case in point. I applaud the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) on his earlier remarks this evening. Opposing for the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4479"> sake of opposing, without cause or conviction, is futile. Thoughtful and stimulating debate is productive. As I said earlier, the days of formal ideology are essentially over.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Gilmore should be one of the shining lights of Australia. I commend this budget on taking the first difficult step in addressing the economic and social problems that confront not only my electorate but the nation as a whole. Moreover, I commend it as a budget that showed the courage to take the initiative to return Australia to economic prosperity, which both our generation and future generations deserve.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australians are entitled to a lot better than what the government is delivering to them in this budget. It is a budget of broken promises in a range of important areas of our social and economic life. It is a budget that sells Australia short in a number of critical areas, even in areas where the government is strong on rhetoric. It is a budget wherein substance often simply does not materialise, where the rhetoric might well have led one to expect it to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget rips nearly $8 billion out of our economy by a savagely contractionary process that undermines the capacity of the Australian economy to grow and hence create jobs. Ironically, by choking growth&mdash;as this budget does&mdash;what is undermined is the government's rationale for so many of its measures, including its debt reduction strategy. Choking growth obviously very much calls into question the government's capacity to achieve the sorts of outcomes that it talks about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By international comparison, Australia is well off in terms of debt, despite the rhetoric and the humbug that we have heard consistently from the government. Australia has the fourth lowest debt and the third lowest budget deficit in the industrialised world. Compare that with the legacy that was inherited by the incoming Hawke government in 1983 after John Howard had been Treasurer: in current dollar terms, the Hawke government inherited a budget deficit of $25 billion. That position was accompanied by high unemployment and an inflation rate of 10 per cent plus.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If one compares that situation with the economic setting of the Howard government upon coming to office earlier this year, one will see that inflation is averaging at just 2&half; per cent, the rate of economic growth is four per cent, 700,000 new jobs have been created over the last three years and there are increasingly diversified exports. Increasing the diversification of our trade with the rest of the world is, in my judgment, the single most crucial issue facing the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, it is a budget of broken promises and a budget that sells Australia short in all sorts of areas. There is a lot of humbug from the government about being committed to families. To prosper and thrive, families need to have their breadwinners in jobs, but this budget is based on savage contraction in the economy and offers no hope for employment. We have seen rising unemployment in recent days. Where does that sit with the government's commitment to families?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the health area, private health funds have taken away the value of health insurance initiatives taken in the budget. Most families with children in care will lose more than they gain from the family tax initiative. In the area of pharmaceutical benefits, we are seeing a budget that savagely slugs families. We will see an undoubted drop in the levels of bulk-billing for medical services, and associated with this are the consequences for families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps the opposite extreme within the public's view of the Commonwealth's budget responsibilities&mdash;and let me go away from families&mdash;is the question of overseas aid. I think this government's rhetoric on this area simply does not match what the budget contains. We have heard the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) talk about 1997 being the Year of South Asia. Frankly, that is something I applaud&mdash;having recently come back from a delegation to that part of the world. That, of course, will be the subject of somewhat more report to this parliament in due course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is identifying an objective for this country in relation to South Asia. If that is accompanied in this budget by savage cuts in huge percentage terms in overseas aid to South Asian countries, I just cannot see <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4480"> that this government, in its dealings in that area, will be able to match its rhetoric with the substance of what it delivers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a government here that talks a lot about its support for business. An effect of this budget is that manufacturers will have a decline in support from government of some 60 per cent over the next three years. Exporters stand to lose $500 million over the next three years as a result of the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Metal Trades Industry Association, hardly a Labor Party front, has recently produced a report on the budget. I would like to refer extensively, if I may, to a number of aspects of that report. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Very significantly, the Government has chosen to severely cut industry programs and to place a charge on imported inputs to manufacturing, at a time when business conditions are extremely difficult, with little prospect of improvement in the short term.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Accounts released on the day of the Budget confirm that manufacturing output growth actually contracted in the June quarter (&hyphen;1.5%), with related falls in employment and profits. To take decisions in these circumstances, across a range of portfolios, that will conservatively leave the manufacturing and construction sectors some $1.1b worse off over the next 2 years (net effect), is risky indeed. Furthermore, the decisions are particularly disappointing and puzzling given the retention of major subsidies to the mining and rural industries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of further concern is that many of these decisions will fall on exporters. The dollar is currently some 20% higher against the TWI than at this time last year, demand conditions are weak and uncertain, and competition in our Asian export markets is rising strongly while growth is easing. These conditions, of themselves, are making exporting so much more difficult and the Budget's prediction of weaker export growth . . . concedes these difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the cuts indicate a weaker commitment by Government to exports of manufactures, this would be viewed with dismay by industry. The single most important achievement&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and this is crucial&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">of the restructuring of Australian industry over the past decade, has been the extraordinary and sustained growth in exports of elaborately transformed manufactures. At a trend rate of about 18% . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The MTIA is saying that this government's rhetoric about business is simply not fair dinkum. I will just run through a few of the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> programs of assistance to exporters that have been slashed in this budget. They include the abolition of the shipbuilding bounty, the abolition of the Asia&hyphen;Pacific fellowship scheme, the abolition of the Asia business links program, the abolition of the Asia infrastructure consortia program, the abolition of the innovative agricultural marketing program, the abolition of the international trade enhancement scheme, the slashed funds for the export market development grants scheme, the reduced funding for the export access program, the abolition of the DIFF scheme&mdash;and I bet that is one Alex wishes he had not touched&mdash;the cut of 14 per cent to Austrade's operational budget, the cut of more than $50 million to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's operational budget over two years, the abolition of the Market Australia program, the cut back of DFAT's international public affairs operations, the abolition of TradeBlazer, the abolition of bounties for computers and related hardware equipment&mdash;and the list does go on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it really is a government of considerable humbug when it talks about itself as having a commitment to supporting business in its important functions of sustaining an increasingly prosperous Australia. It is a government that also sometimes pretends it has concerns about regions of Australia. But we saw the regional development program scrapped even before the minister received a report from McKinsey, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Supporting regional leadership: unfinished business</EMPHASIS>, for which he was paying something like $7,000 a day. I am sure all members would be able to provide examples of very effective regional development programs right across Australia that were contributing towards Australia's economic efficiency, its business efficiency, as well as its social justice through those regional development programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my own particular part of Australia, the northern and western suburbs of Melbourne&mdash;an area that, over the last decade, has faced extraordinarily difficult processes of economic restructuring associated with the new realities we find ourselves in&mdash;the regional development programs and the Commonwealth support for them have been absolutely vital in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4481"> relation to the sorts of adjustments that have been required. There are three particular programs that I want to refer to which are very much under some question now as a result of the Commonwealth pulling the pin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One such very impressive program would benefit not only the west and north of Melbourne but also surrounding agricultural areas&mdash;that is, a freight service for perishable foods. A number of business incubator programs look as if they are in some difficulty. A major program, a feasibility study of a sporting complex associated with the Royal Melbourne Show Grounds, looks as if it may have some limited future with the Commonwealth's withdrawing its support from this important area of activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps though, in my view, the single most damning aspect of this budget is what the government is doing with research and development programs. I believe that to be the case because what it is doing signals a government that is simply myopic, short-sighted, about what is required for the long&hyphen;term future of this country&mdash;what is required to ensure high sustainable rates of growth; what is required to achieve improvements in our trade; and what is required to make this country and its industries increasingly competitive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key to achieving that sort of Australia&mdash;an Australia that is competitive with high and growing incomes&mdash;is increasing emphasis on what are regarded as knowledge intensive industries: those industries that are knowledge intensive in producing goods and services, particularly in the area of elaborately transformed manufactures. I refer back to the importance that the MTIA document that I have referred to placed on that particular part of our economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those parts of production represent the fastest growing areas of world trade. There are considerable opportunities in them for further growth in incomes while, at the same time, providing a stretching out of the balance of payments constraint that has traditionally operated on the rates of growth in Australia. To achieve those effects, research and development and the Commonwealth's commitment <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to them have been an absolute key&mdash;and this budget, in that respect, is an absolute disaster.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week we had the fairly shameful spectacle, I believe, of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) trying to confuse the issue by talking about tax rorts in respect of research and development syndicates. It is a bit rich even for the Liberals to be doing that when it was they who opposed so many of the changes that were introduced by the previous Labor government to iron those very things out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, the reports that were referred to specifically, I understand, by both the Treasurer and the minister for industry have been those very issues which have been picked up by Labor's checks and balances in the system. I think the minister for industry on 1 August in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> in fact conceded that when he said, `Well, they've been knocked back in the evaluation of various programs'&mdash;referring to some of those he then brought into this House and used as some sort of rationale for attacking research and development syndicates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this government is about is throwing out the baby with the bathwater. The reaction to that, which has been widespread, I think is instructive. Professor Sir Gustav Nossal, probably Australia's most eminent scientist, is quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 27 August as warning that Australia's future&mdash;and he puts it that strongly&mdash;has been:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . jeopardised by the federal Budget cuts to tertiary education and incentives for research and development.</PARA>
<PARA>A string of press articles has appeared about the devastating impact of the government's decision to cut back the R&amp;D tax concession and abolish the syndication arrangements on this country's capacity to position itself for higher growth&mdash;higher growth in those industries of elaborately transformed manufactures and knowledge intensive services which are so important to us in the growing areas of world trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, let me perhaps give you some examples of the sorts of programs and some specific programs that will not be available as a result of what this government <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4482"> is doing. JNA Telecommunications Ltd is a company in Melbourne that is expected to generate about $60 million internationally and $30 million domestically over the next three years. That particular company was the beneficiary of syndicated R&amp;D. SCITEC, another Melbourne company, is a communications systems supplier that employs 176 people. An investment in R&amp;D of about $17 million was syndication financed at a time when the company was severely capital constrained. There have been discoveries related to AIDS by a syndicate involving the McFarlane Burnett Centre, the New South Wales Blood Bank and the Amrad Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the sorts of vital initiatives which we need for our country's future but which this government, through its so cavalier treatment of the research and development industry resulting from this budget, is taking from us. This is against the context of the Liberal policy statement on science where they actually said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . changes to the syndicated research and development tax concession guidelines may well result in the drying up of one of the few effective forms of venture capital available in Australia to fund research and development.</PARA>
<PARA>What absolute hypocrisy on the part of this government to adopt that in their policy going into the election but then for us to find that they treat the issue in such a cavalier way when they come to power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me restate the importance of some of these issues. Business research and development trebled as a share of gross domestic product in the decade to 1993-94. There was a sharp rise in that decade in the research and development intensity of Australian manufacturing. There has been powerful evidence from academic studies of a link between increasing business research and development and increased exports. Australia undoubtedly is very competitive internationally in its capacity to do research and development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have the Bureau of Industry Economics in 1994, on the syndicated research and development scheme, reporting that syndicated R&amp;D is a uniquely Australian and uniquely successful means of providing government <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> support to building high-tech businesses. Despite the government's rhetoric about tax rorts, that particular BIE report found that the syndicates had a high rate of inducement of R&amp;D, with about $2.60 of additional R&amp;D induced for every dollar of research undertaken by participants which would have gone ahead anyway. The BIE study concluded that the syndication program can be seen as `a unique and highly effective instrument for cheaply stimulating new R&amp;D'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Across that whole range of areas, we see cant and nonsense being talked by the government; we see a myopic short-sightedness in relation to this country's future. The area I do want to stress is that so much of this country's future&mdash;its capacity to grow, stimulate jobs and be competitive&mdash;is in that area of value adding to knowledge intensive areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With not only this government's actual cutbacks to research and development programs but all that that signals to companies who have a range of choices as to where they may locate those sorts of activities&mdash;whether they locate them in Australia or elsewhere&mdash;what this government's lack of commitment indicates is, I think, quite devastating for the outlook and the economic future of this country. I believe that this is a budget that deserves to be roundly condemned.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There have been consistent calls for a royal commission into the Western Australian <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4483"> police force. Given the incestuous nature of the legal system in that state and all the cosy relationships that exist between the judges, leading barristers and certain policemen, I do not think that this would be effective unless someone was appointed from outside the state, preferably from overseas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is desperately needed is a thorough inquiry into the administration of justice. A parliamentary inquiry with all the powers of a royal commission would be better than Caesar judging Caesar. For a whole variety of reasons, I have little faith in Commissioner Falconer. The area of special investigation should centre on ex-Commissioner Bull, his Deputy Commissioner Ayton and the man who said he was the only one he could trust&mdash;the Director of Public Prosecutions, John McKechnie.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tonight I want to address myself to Mr Ayton. I was amused to see him in the paper and on the radio blathering about being denied natural justice. It is my view that no-one should be denied natural justice, but I realise that it is much easier for a man in his position to get natural justice than for many of the people he has so maliciously persecuted. He has destroyed the lives and careers of many serving officers and has wreaked havoc on their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> he lashed out at two former serving officers&mdash;Detective Sergeant Barnes and his former boss, Colin Pace. I knew Colin Pace when he was a sergeant at Port Hedland in my electorate from about 1991 to 1994, I think. I had a pretty serious argument with him, the details of which I now really cannot remember. However, never did I have any cause to doubt his integrity. In fact, some of the innuendo regarding the condoning of illegal gambling is just outright nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Ayton apparently sees no problem in blackguarding these people. He did exactly the same to Sergeant Waghorn, a man of impeccable record and a man I am very proud to call a friend. Briefly, the facts are these. A drug dealer was caught. In his defence he claimed that he did not remember signing a statement. An internal inquiry ensued and Sergeant Waghorn was totally exonerated. Mr <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Ayton, for whatever reason, was not happy so he arranged with his mate John McKechnie from the DPP to charge Sergeant Waghorn anyway. Sergeant Waghorn then went to a preliminary hearing and the magistrate threw the case out, saying that there was not a scintilla of evidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not satisfied, Mr Ayton got the DPP to charge Sergeant Waghorn ex officio. Eventually, the case went to court and the drug dealer, who had in the meantime got himself off drugs, wishing to set the record straight had made a statutory declaration saying he had in fact signed a statement&mdash;information known to the DPP at the preliminary hearing and ignored. After hearing the Crown case, the jury threw the Crown case out in record time. I think the jury was out for about 30 minutes. If you take out about 15 minutes for a cup of tea, they certainly did not waste any time on the Crown's case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Was justice done? I think not. Sergeant Waghorn had been through two years of hell, placing enormous strain on his family. During the period, Mr Waghorn's father had died of cancer, not knowing what the fate of his son would be. I know that this weighs very heavily on Brad Waghorn. What did McKechnie, Ayton and Bull care? They had wasted a large amount of taxpayers' money on a case that should never have gone to court and played havoc with the lives of innocent people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that Frances Nelson QC had Les Ayton's measure when she described him as dishonest, unreliable, racist, vindictive and many other unsavoury terms arising out of evidence he gave to a government inquiry into allegations regarding the establishment and management of the casino in South Australia. Nelson QC demonstrated that Ayton's modus operandi was to decide that someone was guilty and then to set out to collect the evidence, ignoring all the exculpatory evidence.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wanted to bring the House's attention to the recommendation by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee for subsidy of betaferon for the treatment of patients with relapsing and remitting multiple sclerosis. This is very welcome news for people with multiple sclerosis. The approval of betaferon for listing will make a difference to thousands of MS sufferers, the vast majority of whom are unable to afford unsubsidised access to this treatment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One such sufferer wrote me a very passionate letter asking for my support for listing of betaferon. Her letter touched me and reinforced my opinion that this drug should be listed as soon as possible. She writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis 2 years ago. At that time I was informed of a drug Betaferon which was being developed to combat the disease and since then I have monitored closely the progress of this drug.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you no doubt understand, I have awaited the introduction of the drug into Australia with much excitement and anticipation. Knowing there was hope certainly made it easier for me to survive the past couple of years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am only 23 years old. Two years ago I ice&hyphen;skated for Queensland and represented Australia in my sport. I was fit and active, enjoying all the things 21 year olds enjoy. Revelling in the fact that I was young and alive. Now I cannot walk for more than 15 minutes per day (stumbling most of the way and with 90 year olds overtaking me). Now, only 2 years later, I feel like an old woman.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would not wish to have anyone experience what I have been through and what I continue to endure daily. Nor would I wish to see a close friend or relative suffer from the disease.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, my greatest fear is that, because Governments have no personal experience with the disease, the people who have the power to decide <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> whether Betaferon is listed do not really know or appreciate multiple sclerosis's misery.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over the past few months alone I have experienced a severe attack in my right leg, a milder attack in my left leg and a loss of strength and co&hyphen;ordination in my right hand. With every nerve that is damaged, I wonder whether this is it. Has the disease turned chronic and am I to progressively deteriorate, at an unpredictable rate?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sometimes the nerve will rebuild itself and I will breathe a sigh of relief&mdash;but only to wake up the next day with another attack. I have been on a rollercoaster for the past 2 years and I still don't know whether the trip from here is all downhill. At the risk of sounding melodramatic, the feeling is (I am sure) akin to being buried alive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the listing of Betaferon I have a chance to reclaim my life. But every day that goes past my chances are slowly being taken away from me. If I am given that chance, I have much to contribute to society. I am in my second year of articles with a big inner city law firm and will finish my law degree at the end of this year with first class honours. I will also finish an economics degree by the middle of next year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have experienced more than many people will in their lifetime, and I have grown strong. I want to use what I have learnt and the strength that I have gained to contribute to society. The alternative, if Betaferon is not listed, is that I become increasingly reliant upon society to support me because of my illness. I am sure that I don't have to do the sums for you.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I understand that the government, like anyone, has only limited funds to go around. But please don't tell me my life is not worth $18,000 a year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Betaferon should be listed on the PBS on moral, ethical and on pure economic terms. The initial expense is justified if you consider that without the drug I will most likely have to live off welfare for a significant proportion of my life.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, at my age, this drug is a cure. It will significantly reduce the number of exacerbations that I will suffer from; accordingly it will stymie the cumulative force of the disease and significantly reduce the risk of permanent disability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I beg the Government to do the right thing and ensure that Betaferon is listed. Research for a more effective drug or even a complete cure continues, with the benefit of knowledge obtained from the development of Betaferon. But, in the meantime, please do not take away my chance to lead a happy and fulfilling life. I really do think I deserve one and I will repay society many times over.</PARA>
<PARA>Hers is a truly inspirational story. I look forward to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee's favourable recommendation <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4485"> and to seeing that this important drug is listed on the PBS schedule as early as November 1996.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<ELECTORATE> (Batman)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(10.34 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this evening to talk about the future of the textile, clothing and footwear industry. It is an industry of particular importance in my electorate of Batman, which is in the northern suburbs of Melbourne. In doing so, I must say that I was quite `underwhelmed' to recently read in a piece of PR bumph sent to me that the coalition Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, the member for Ryan, Mr Moore, has given strong support to the TCF industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Ryan recently chaired the first meeting of the TCF Advisory Board. Unfortunately for the industry, that meeting was held prior to the coalition budget. Many people in the industry, both employers and employees, were stunned by the budget decision to abolish, without any full and proper consultation, the unique and important labour market adjustment program set up for TCF workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key role of the TCF Advisory Board, which involves employers and employees as well as the government, is to improve consultation. The minister chaired that inaugural meeting of this important board promoting consultation. But here we have an important initiative of the government&mdash;the TCF labour adjustment program&mdash;abolished without any consultation, without any concern for the needs of those workers in the industry who have worked long and hard over very many years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The labour adjustment program was created in recognition&mdash;and we should not lose sight of this issue&mdash;of the fact that many workers in the industry would lose their jobs because of government trade policy, the opening up of Australia's trade barriers in association with international globalisation of the Australian economy. It has to be noted that they would lose their jobs through no fault of their own. The great majority of these workers&mdash;those to be assisted by the program&mdash;are those with low levels of education, migrant women of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> non-English&hyphen;speaking background and outworkers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The TCF labour adjustment program provided wage subsidies for up to 18 months so as to ensure that those workers who were dislodged as a result of the restructure in the industry had an opportunity to enter relevant training and, if need be, to get assistance with relocation.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate of Batman, over the last four months more than 400 TCF workers have lost their jobs because of the massive changes that are continuing to occur in the industry. Just half of them would have been eligible for the special TCF labour market adjustment program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also note that this program just does not assist my electorate. Around the nation more than 1,500 workers in the industry have lost their jobs in the last four months. If the labour adjustment program had continued in this budget, more than half of these people, who are predominantly women, would have been eligible for support under the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In South Australia&mdash;the home state of the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone)&mdash;some 38 people who lost their jobs at a clothing factory called Protector Safety and at a footwear factory called John Firth and Sons could have been eligible for the labour adjustment program. In Minister Moore's home state of Queensland, where the TCF industry is not very strong, some 15 people who lost their jobs in June from a clothing factory in Brisbane called Freedman Pty Ltd could have been assisted. Twelve of these people were eligible without a doubt for the special adjustment program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In central Victoria, where I recently visited, one former TCF worker who had benefited from the labour market adjustment program broke down when she questioned me about what would happen to other workers in the region. With the closure in recent weeks of Holeproof in Horsham, over 100 workers will similarly be denied assistance as a result of this budget decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I consider that there is an onus on all of us to assist these workers. These people's low levels of skills give them little hope of getting a new opportunity in life. Now, because of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4486"> the abolition of the labour market adjustment program, they have little hope of getting the finances to assist them if they desire to relocate. For example, Clarks Shoes in my electorate is to relocate from northern Melbourne to the suburbs of Adelaide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say in conclusion that it is high time the Liberal government revisited its budget decisions. Some workers out there in industries such as the textile, clothing and footwear industry demand special assistance. They demand it because they are losing their jobs through no fault of their own. There is an obligation on the Australian community to go out of our way to ensure that, as we open up the Australian economy to international competition, we do everything possible to assist those workers. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in the House tonight to give recognition to a dedicated group of young Australians currently forging a name for themselves in my electorate and, undoubtedly, eventually nationwide. This is happening at a time when the youth of our nation&mdash;especially our indigenous youth&mdash;are coming more and more under the spotlight of review and when multiculturalism is under attack. I was delighted last weekend to officiate at the opening of an event that I feel sure will become a featured model of just what can be done when indigenous people are led by people of their own culture who have drive, vision and dedication to the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Cairns is fortunate to have amongst its many fine community groups one that shines out above the norm. Tribal Colours of the Pacific is the vision of one very dedicated young man, Mr Aquilar Luki. He brings together indigenous youths from various Australian and South Pacific backgrounds in an enjoyable and learning environment that both celebrates their heritage and gives them pride in their roots.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tribal Colours of the Pacific is founded on a drug free concept, with all of the youths involved being alcohol, drug and tobacco free. These concepts are projected through the group's cultural performances in song and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> dance. With ages ranging from 10 through to 26 years, Tribal Colours of the Pacific now boasts some 40 dancers based predominantly in Cairns, but also with some dancers studying at universities in Toowoomba and Canberra. The group works very closely with the police and citizens youth clubs around Far North Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The group reflects Far North Queensland's exceptionally diverse indigenous cultural base, as it currently comprises 11 Aboriginals, 11 Torres Strait Islanders, three Papua New Guineans, four Samoans, two Tongans, one Tahitian, two New Zealanders, two Niuans, one Fijian, two Cook Islanders and one Solomon Islander. It is a very diverse group but one that both performs superbly and mixes magnificently because of its base of a celebration of common linked cultures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All members of Tribal Colours are taught arts, crafts, song and dance from various cultures of the Pacific, studying under older tutors from the various islands who now live in Cairns. But the hard work and dreams of Aquilar Luki and his supporters do not end there. Their eventual aim is to emulate the success of the world famous Pacific Cultural Centre in Hawaii, where students from all over the Pacific live on campus in their own university dividing their studies between modern professional skills as well as the relearning of the unique cultural skills of their parents, grandparents and great&hyphen;grandfathers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anyone who has witnessed the daily afternoon shows conducted through the various South Pacific villages of Hawaii's Pacific Cultural Centre will surely agree that the dreams of Aquilar Luki and his Tribal Colours group promise to be one of the most exciting concepts ever offered in Australia to indigenous youth. Their own university will give them equal emphasis on professional qualifications as well as preserving their own unique cultural heritage. Such a facility not only will become one of Cairns's major tourist attractions but will provide an absolutely unique avenue for upper secondary and tertiary education on campus for all of our Pacific people who have made Cairns and Far North Queensland their home.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4487">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If anyone here doubts the attraction of well-organised and well-presented indigenous cultural events, last weekend's inaugural Pacific Cultural Festival&mdash;held at the Cairns Police and Citizens Youth Club&mdash;was sold out weeks ahead of the event. The magnificent display of cultural music and dancing, combined with a veritable smorgasbord of traditional dishes, was the resounding success that it and the hard work of the people and kids of Tribal Colours well deserved. Not a single person who attended, including me, walked away from that evening without being deeply touched and enriched by this wonderful experience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like tonight to commend Aquilar Luki and the youths of Tribal Colours of the Pacific and their supporters who made this first ever Pacific Cultural Festival the success it was. With people such as these leading our indigenous groups, instilling self-esteem and hope for their future, it fills my heart with pride to see the dedication to both the future and the past that is being encouraged amongst our indigenous youth&mdash;and all without the pervading influence of the drug and alcohol culture that we often associate with modern youth. Tribal Colours of the Pacific goes on its annual non-profit Queensland tour at the end of this month. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier tonight I observed that, as a result of the recent budget, it is abundantly clear that the ethos of this government is that, if you cannot pay, you miss out. There is evidence of this in a range of areas&mdash;home and community care, dental treatment and nursing homes, to name a few. Another area where this ethos can be found is in relation to access to the information super&hyphen;highway via the Internet for all Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Regrettably, the recent actions of the government in this vitally important area have not received much attention. In the budget, the Howard-Costello government has pulled the plug on access to the Internet for all Australians through public libraries. As part of the Creative Nation program, the previous Labor government paved the way for all Australians to have the opportunity of access ing the information super highway by linking public libraries to on-line services such as the Internet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor government provided $11.4 million to link all 1,400 public libraries around Australia at a cost of about $7,000 each. This was a small price to pay to ensure that all Australians would have access to these services. The decision recognised that the rapid advances in information technology had the potential to create a new form of discrimination between those who could afford access and those who could not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The development of a new form of disadvantage between the information rich and the information poor should be a matter of grave concern to all of us as legislators. The victories of the 19th and 20th centuries to ensure equal access to educational opportunities for all have to be protected. Access to the information superhighway should not be denied on the basis that a person cannot afford to buy the equipment. But this is exactly what will happen as a result of the policies of this government. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has pulled the plug on the Internet at public libraries. The budget cut $9.2 million out of the program. One suspects that this is everything that was not already spent. This is bad policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is surely also bad economics to restrict the access of one part of the community to information services and associated opportunities on the basis of their bank balance. There are areas of public policy into which this mean&hyphen;spirited ethos of `if you can't pay, you miss out' must not be allowed to intrude. Access to information technology is one of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this context, I was greatly concerned by the story in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Computer Age</EMPHASIS> of today suggesting that universities may soon have to pay for access to the Net. Are we heading for a modern version of 18th century Britain where only the rich could read&mdash;a return to when basic education was denied the poor as it was felt that this might lead them to question their place in the social order? Australia goes down this path at its peril.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the constituents of Scullin the Labor government's initiative would have built on <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4488"> the development of on&hyphen;line services being undertaken at the time by the local regional library service, the Yarra Plenty Regional Library Service. I congratulate this regional library service for their initiatives in this area. It is regrettable that the federal government has shown that it lacks the same breadth of vision. Thanks to the Prime Minister, in the area of public access to Internet&mdash;as in many other areas&mdash;many of the constituents of Scullin are being effectively told by the federal government, `If you can't pay, you miss out.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the same vein I note, and indicate my disquiet, that not only do we see in the budget papers a lack of commitment to the extension of the Triple J network&mdash;which, according to the budget papers, is to achieve a saving of $2.5 million over four years&mdash;but also there is another line item which indicates there has been a cessation of the radio Triple J Internet site, J Net, which would save $2.1 million over three years.</PARA><!-- <ERROR>Class: 1

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I rise tonight to talk about some of the small, micro and medium sized businesses in the electorate of Dunkley by the bay. There are about 8,000 such businesses, many of them run by sole proprietors. These people run shops and service delivery agencies. They are often busy during the day with customers and clients. They spend their evenings&mdash;rather than watching question time&mdash;doing their paperwork.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are other so-called business people out there who make a living from preying on these honest small business proprietors and their employees. One such scam was brought to my attention last night by an operator of an excellent gift shop in the suburb of Mount Eliza in my electorate. This scam, which was brought to my attention by Cynthia Fewster, who runs this gift shop, was quite disgraceful. I need to bring it to the attention of the House and many small business proprietors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One lunchtime while Mrs Fewster was looking after a number of customers in her shop the phone rang. She answered the phone and the voice at the other end addressed her by her name and read out a recent advertisement, almost word for word, that she had placed in one of our local newspapers, which she believed was the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Frankston Flier</EMPHASIS>. That is a local fortnightly publication. A similar ad had appeared in a number of the other local Frankston and Peninsula newspapers.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The caller asked Mrs Fewster if she would like to advertise in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Federal Environmental Journal</EMPHASIS>. Not unnaturally, Mrs Fewster was in a bit of a hurry to get off the phone and get back to making some money from her customers, and she gave a fairly indeterminate answer. The persistent caller said that most people gave their birth date as a reference number. This was not to send Mrs Fewster a birthday card but to send her, in the next few days, what looked like a bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the call was finished, Mrs Fewster did not think much about it. But shortly thereafter a fake invoice arrived for $289, being the supposed cost of an advertisement covering one&hyphen;eighth of a page of this journal, which I might mention is not known to anyone in the minister's office, is not recognised by anybody I speak to, but is allegedly being published somewhere up on the border between Queensland and New South Wales. The invoice curiously stated that there is `no claim made on this charge'. I wonder whether, if we were to challenge the proprietors about this paperwork&mdash;which, incidentally, has no ACN number on it&mdash;they would say, `It is not really an invoice. It might be a quote or something.' I am not quite sure what the line would be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mrs Fewster also got a thankyou from the advertiser stating that the publication would contain much needed information on environmental matters as well as editorials by councils, government departments and the like. It further stated that, if she were to pay her account within 14 days of the booking, she would receive a discount.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A couple of days later a courier company arrived at her doorstep complete with a reply paid courier satchel for the cheque and a mock&hyphen;up of this so&hyphen;called journal. The invoice and the thankyou note carried an address at Mudgeeraba, which is on the Gold Coast. Mrs Fewster was smart enough to refuse to pay the money over.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Upon checking, we found that the business name was registered to a Robina, Gold Coast address under an Australian company number&mdash;which we also pursued&mdash;which was a shelf company registered somewhere else in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4491"> Queensland. The person behind the company was a Ms Little.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To cut a long story short, Ms Little was also registered under the business name of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Federal Environmental Journal</EMPHASIS> but at a different address. The address that is provided has no such business there; it is vacant. It is above the electorate office of my friend and colleague the member for Richmond (Mr Anthony). There is no such journal being published that we can establish. This scam is going on to take advantage of hardworking, busy small business people in my electorate and throughout the country. The proprietors are preying on these busy people, hitting on them to pay for sham advertising.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recommend that proprietors be wary of these advertisers, who are trying to exploit the high level of sales competition and the heavy workloads of many people operating small businesses in our country. If you do happen to come across a copy of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Federal Environmental Journal</EMPHASIS>, be very careful about it, and certainly do not pay for an advertisement.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<ANSWER PAGE="4493" SPEAKER="Sharp, John, MP" NAMEID="AJ4" ELECTORATE="Hume" PARTY="NP" MINISTERIAL="Transport and Regional Development" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AJ4">Mr Sharp</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The Australian National Railways Commission (AN) has advised that the written down replacement value of this line is $256,360,000. The written down book value is $106,300,000. However, the AN Track Access Unit advises that the earning potential of the line implies a market value somewhat less than these figures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) AN currently owns and maintains the line. The National Rail Corporation (NR) operates freight trains over the line, for which it pays AN a fee. AN itself operates only the Ghan passenger train over the line. If the line were transferred to an Alice Springs&hyphen;Darwin railway operator, AN would lose the income stream from NR (and any other operator who might choose to operate trains to Alice Springs) and be relieved of the cost of maintaining the line. AN would need to pay an access fee to the new owner for Ghan operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Government is committed to establishing a new organisation to own and maintain the interstate rail network. This could include the Tarcoola&hyphen;Alice Springs line. Thus, AN may not continue to own the line in the longer term, but would continue to operate the Ghan over it for a fee. This is the same position that AN would be in if the line were transferred to a developer who constructs and operates the Alice Springs&hyphen;Darwin line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The Government believes that the private sector is the key to the construction and operation <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4494"> of an Alice Springs to Darwin line, and will facilitate any economically viable proposal for private enterprise to construct the line. In addition to providing the existing Tarcoola&hyphen;Alice Springs line to a private developer prepared to build and operate an Alice Springs&hyphen;Darwin railway, the Government would also consider tax issues as they affect the viability of the line. The project would be eligible for infrastructure bonds if assessed by the Development Allowance Authority to meet the necessary criteria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the offer of the Alice Springs to Tarcoola line were not taken up by the time the proposed interstate track authority is established and other interstate track transferred, the Alice Springs&hyphen;Tarcoola track might also be transferred to the track authority. However, it could be transferred to new ownership at a later time.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes. Under the Council's `Program Grants' program, magazines with a minimum circulation or sales of 1000 copies per issue, distributed nationally and devoted entirely to Australian creative writing, or with 10,000 copies distributed free of charge per issue, are eligible to apply for core funding grants for a three year period. Foundation grants for completely new magazines, devoted predominantly to the publication of Australian creative writing, are also offered under this program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, under the `Commissions' program, certain magazines with a minimum circulation of 500 copies sold per issue or 10,000 copies distributed free of charge per issue are eligible to apply for fees to literary contributors (but not for core funding).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) The determination was made in November 1995, for applications in 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) The Literature Fund assists literary magazines as a means to an end&mdash;the publication and promotion of Australian writers and writing. The Fund considers that it is more likely to achieve this objective if literary magazines are encouraged to increase circulation and hence the potential audience for Australian writers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of its normal evaluation process, in 1994 the Literature Fund employed a consultant to evaluate its Literary Magazines Program. The evaluation recommended, as a means of encouraging increased circulation, that the minimum eligibility figure for core funding be lifted from 500 copies subscribed/sold to 1000 copies. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4495"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over 1995 the Board consulted with literary magazines editors, publishers, writers and other interested parties on the proposed revisions to its literary magazines funding program. Following analysis of the views put forward and further discussion, the Board developed the new ways of funding magazines referred to above.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Fund believes that the 1000 copies minimum eligibility level for magazines applying for core funding is not onerous or unrealistic. The majority of magazines that are funded have subscriptions/sales that exceed this threshold. Moreover, in some cases magazines may have had more than 20 years of substantial funding from the Council in which to reach that circulation threshold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Furthermore, there is an alternative means of funding for these magazines with a circulation between 500 and 1,000. Grants of between $10,000&mdash;$20,000 will be given to magazine applicants under this program to help them attract work by new and established writers. This alternative is also designed to increase circulation&mdash;by encouraging the commissioning of writers the Fund expects that the magazines will be able to attract more innovative material that will appeal to a wider audience.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) (a) Several types of `very fast train' have been brought to my attention recently. These include the French TGV, which is part of a proposal by the Speedrail consortium to establish a very fast train service between Sydney and Canberra, as well as the `MagLev' train, and various `tilt' trains of the type which the New South Wales Government recently examined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) The New South Wales, Australian Capital Territory and Commonwealth Governments are currently examining the feasibility of a high speed rail service between Canberra and Sydney. Governments will be considering the costs and benefits of such a service when this study is completed. The study is focused on the general concept of a very fast train service and will not provide a detailed assessment of particular technology options such as the `MagLev' train to which the honourable member refers. However, the study will provide a brief review of a range of technology alternatives that may be suitable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4)(a) and (b) I have had several meetings with interested parties and discussed the benefits and costs to Goulburn and surrounding districts of a Canberra&hyphen;Sydney very fast train service operating through Goulburn. However, the present emphasis is on examining the feasibility of the overall service and providing a better basis for governments to consider the way ahead. Should the project proceed beyond this stage, there will need to be considerably more work done to consider the precise route as well as the technology to be used.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5)(a) and (b) Since taking office, the Government has received no formal submissions for building Sydney's second airport at Goulburn. However, the Government has received, and continues to receive, many letters from the public suggesting a variety of alternative sites for a second Sydney airport, including Goulburn.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Between 1990 and 1992, the Commonwealth provided $20 million to New South Wales for the upgrading of local access roads to the Badgerys Creek airport site.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(9)(a) and (b) The first stage of the construction of Sydney West Airport, as planned by the former Government, was estimated to cost $327 million.

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8E4">Dr Wooldridge</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) It is extremely difficult to provide an exact figure for the number of Aboriginal Land Councils that exist in Australia. Some are established by Commonwealth and State legislation. Other Aboriginal organisations with the term `land council' in their title have been incorporated under relevant State legislation or the Commonwealth's  Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act 1976. ATSIC does not fund all such bodies, nor is it aware of the budget details of all such bodies. From the information available to it, ATSIC has  identified 140 land councils.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Attachment A provides the locations of these 140 Aboriginal Land Councils.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) (a) The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) can provide precise information on funds that it provides to land councils. In the case of the Land Councils in the Northern Territory established under the Aboriginal Land <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 (NT Land Rights Act), ATSIC can also provide precise information on statutory royalty equivalent payments from the Aboriginals Benefit Trust Account (ABTA).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">74 statutory and non-statutory Aboriginal Land Councils received $37,655,054 in funding from ATSIC in the 1995-96 financial year. In addition, aggregate statutory royalty equivalent payments of  $27,193,122 were made to the Northern Territory Land Councils from the ABTA according to ABTA financial statements for the year ended 30 June 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Information on the total revenue that Aboriginal Land Councils derive from State governments is not available to ATSIC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) In relation to mining in the Northern Territory, an equivalent amount to mining royalties received by the Government in respect of mining on Aboriginal land is paid into the ABTA by the Commonwealth. The NT Land Rights Act provides for the payment of monies from the ABTA for  the administrative purposes of the Land Councils  established under the NT Land Rights Act and distribution to royalty associations and communities. As mentioned above, the total revenue Aboriginal land councils derived from mining royalties in the form of statutory royalty equivalents payments under Subsections 64(1), (3) and (7) of the Land Rights Act in the Northern Territory in 1995&hyphen;96 was $27,193,122.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Information from State Governments on the total revenue Aboriginal Land Councils derive from mining royalties in those states where mining may have taken place on Aboriginal land is not available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) Apart from information in respect of the Land Councils established under the NT Land Rights Act, information is not readily available on the  <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4498"> revenue that Aboriginal Land Councils derive from other sources. Based on Annual reports tabled in Parliament, Land Councils in the Northern Territory received self-generated operating revenues from other sources in 1994&hyphen;5 as follows:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Anindilyakwa Land Council&mdash;13,410; Tiwi Land Council&mdash;38,451</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Extensive reporting of financial details is required of ATSIC grant recipients including Aboriginal Land Councils. The four statutory Aboriginal Land Councils in the Northern Territory have additional requirements as Commonwealth Statutory Authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">For grants from ATSIC, the Land Councils are required to provide audited financial statements and a certificate signed by the Chairperson of the Land Council stating that the grant funds have been used for the agreed purpose and that all terms and conditions of the grant have been fully and properly complied with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the case of the Land Councils in the Northern Territory, as statutory authorities of the Commonwealth, the Land Councils provide reports annually to the Parliament, including audited financial statements. Aboriginal Land Councils established as statutory authorities under State legislation report to the relevant State Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) ATSIC provided grants totalling $4.8 million to Land Councils in 1995&hyphen;96 for health, housing and education.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RI4">Mr Prosser</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) On 2 May 1996, the Prime Minister announced the establishment of the Small Business Deregulation Task Force. The Task Force is required to report to the Government by November 1996 on revenue neutral measures to reduce the paper and compliance burden on small business by 50 per cent within the first term of the Government. The Task Force is on schedule to report by 1 November 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The undertaking relates essentially to Commonwealth regulation, but the Task Force has been asked to make an assessment of the interaction with State and local government business regulation and compliance requirements and in cooperation with the States, look more broadly at the overall regulatory environment. At the National Small Business Summit held on 12 June this year, all governments agreed to work with the Task <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4502"> Force to reduce the paperwork and compliance burdens imposed on small business. In addition, Small Business Ministers agreed to meet later this year to discuss the recommendations of the Task Force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The Task Force has commissioned research to identify the paperwork and regulatory compliance burden on small business. The preliminary findings of the research concludes that in general small business does not distinguish between the three spheres of government when assessing the burden. Yellow Pages was engaged to undertake a national survey of small business in order to identify a national benchmark of the compliance burden. The results of this research will be available in mid&hyphen;September.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) The National Small Business Summit agreed to exchange information on the development of benchmarking and compliance cost assessment to enable governments to measure their performance in reducing the burdens placed on small business. The Task Force is expected to make some recommendations in this area.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Construction of the new DFAT building is not yet complete. At this stage, the forecast total cost for the project on completion is $162,040,899.00.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) No additional alteration costs are planned for the DFAT building. Some works to the value of $3.669 million will be undertaken following the completion of the John Holland fitout contract. These works have been accumulated over the past six months in order to avoid the high penalty costs of including them in the original John Holland fitout. They involve the normal range of corrections and adjustments which have arisen from documentation and alignment problems. Some costs are also attributable to co&hyphen;ordination between the many subcontractors on site. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA></ANSWER></ANSWER.TO.QON></ANSWERS.TO.QUESTIONS></HANSARD>
