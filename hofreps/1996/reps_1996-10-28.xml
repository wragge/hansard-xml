<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Procedure, I present the committee's report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bills&mdash;Consideration in detail: review of the operation of standing order 226</EMPHASIS>  together with the minutes of proceedings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ordered that the report be printed.</PARA>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3E4">Mrs SULLIVAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the Procedure Committee's second report of the 38th parliament. It addresses an issue which is probably not in the forefront of members' thoughts but, nonetheless, is fundamental to their rights and responsibilities as members of the House of Representatives. In July this year, Mr Speaker, you wrote to the Procedure Committee drawing its attention to changes in standard drafting practice which have been adopted by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. You asked the committee to consider and, if appropriate, report on the consideration in detail of bills by the House in the light of the varying format of bills presented to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue arises from the fact that in 1995 the OPC altered its standard drafting practice so that proposed amendments to existing acts became items in schedules attached to amending bills. Previously they would have been contained within the clauses of the bills, other than minor or machinery amendments which were usually placed in schedules. Bills for new acts still contain the principle provisions within the clauses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This means that there are now two basic types of bills, each type having different structures. New bills are structured in the traditional way with all the substantive matters in the clauses, but amending bills contain the substantive provisions in one or more schedules to the bill. The new format of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> amending bills raises the question as to whether the House's traditional method of considering the provisions of a bill is still the most appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Standing order 226, which prescribes the order in which the House will consider a bill in detail, provides for clauses to be considered individually, but for each schedule to be taken as a whole. Previously, amendments to laws were drafted as several clauses of an amending bill and each clause could be considered and voted on separately. Under the new format they may comprise many varying items within a schedule which are considered and voted on as one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee was unanimous in its view that the right of the House to examine amending legislation in the detail traditionally enjoyed by the House should be maintained. Thus the standing orders should reflect and protect the right of the House to examine each significant part of an amending bill in the same way as it can for a new bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee has therefore recommended an amendment to standing order 226 which will have the effect of ensuring that the House has the right to consider individually each item within a schedule attached to an amending bill, unless the House grants leave for certain items&mdash;or the entire schedule&mdash;to be considered together. This would be consistent with the procedures currently followed in respect of the consideration of clauses of bills and the consideration of schedules attached to appropriation bills. Most importantly, it would ensure that the House enjoys the same rights in respect of amendments contained in the schedules to amending bills as it does in relation to the clauses of new bills&mdash;whilst, of course, retaining the right to streamline the process by agreement of all members present.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said at the beginning, this is probably not the sort of provision that moves members very much. In fact, the change to presenting amendments in schedules is one that even long-serving members of the House probably had not noticed or at least they may well not have realised the import of the change. I am grateful to you, Mr Speaker, for having written to me to ask the committee to consider this matter. The right of members to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> consider amendments is very important. I personally have always been rather disturbed by the statute law amendment bills which come into this House from time to time, usually a couple of times a year, listing under one heading amendments to a very wide range of bills. The breaking down of any such bill into individual bills is to be welcomed, although I do recognise there would be an additional cost and an amount of work involved in that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that members have placed before them individual amendments to bills to draw their attention to the changes proposed. The recommendation that the committee has made will extend members' rights to consider proposed amendments in the sort of detail that those amendments ought to attract. The Leader of the House (Mr Reith) is presently waiting on some further advice from the Procedure Committee in relation to a range of previous recommendations that the committee has made over the years to various governments. I hope that, when he considers all the reports that the committee hopes to bring in by the end of this session, this amendment is one that will be included in any proposed changes next year. I commend the report to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I present the committee's report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Defence Sub&hyphen;Committee: Visit <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5854"> to Queensland and the Northern Territory 5&hyphen;8 August 1996</EMPHASIS> , together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ordered that the report be printed.</PARA>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5E4">Mr SINCLAIR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In presenting the report, I would like to make a few observations upon it. It is a report that followed a short tour of inspection&mdash;inspections for which on earlier occasions when you were in a happier role you were able to accompany the rest of us, Mr Speaker. It was a visit made to northern facilities&mdash;Brisbane, Townsville and Darwin&mdash;in August this year. The program placed appropriate emphasis on what all of us accept as the essential briefing of members of parliament through the Defence Subcommittee on learning first-hand about the Australian Defence Force, its members, its priorities and how the defence personnel relate to the events in our strategically important part of the world and, in this instance, in northern Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although short, the program of visits and meetings provided very useful information for the members of the subcommittee, particularly those who have not previously served in that capacity. I take this opportunity to welcome new members of the parliament to the subcommittee. During the program, we had many opportunities to discuss topical defence issues with commanding officers and service personnel, and we gained valuable insight into modern defence capabilities and requirements in the north.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report we presented does not pretend to be an exhaustive discussion of all the topics raised with or by the subcommittee during the familiarisation program, but in our conclusions we identified some of the particular aspects that we felt were relevant. I draw the attention of honourable members to those, which are on page 33 of the report in section 5. We were particularly interested in seeing what has been undertaken through the Army Presence in the North concept, which has been developing in the services generally since the opening of the new HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Darwin</EMPHASIS> defence base when my predecessor Sir James Killen was Minister for Defence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> As far as APIN is concerned, the new emphasis began with the opening of Robert son Barracks in 1989 and will continue until the final phase of the project in the year 2001. Fully realised, it will mean the relocation of some 2,300 soldiers and 2,600 family members to Darwin. APIN represents a departure from the traditional home location elements of the Australian Defence Force and is predominantly designed to ensure that the members of the Australian Defence Force are climatically adapted and are located where we can best provide a response, if necessary, in the more remote areas of Australia and to any threat that might emerge from outside Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">APIN represents a major commitment to increasing Australia's defence capabilities in the north. It is also a major financial investment. It is a clear example of tailoring modern construction to meet the demands of the terrain and the climate of the tropics. The overall cost of the project is around $500 million, and there are significant flow&hyphen;on effects for the Northern Territory economy. We learned that at present Defence is directly spending an average of $2 million per week in the Northern Territory, which with construction would be closer to $4 million per week, not including construction and maintenance expenditure by the Defence Housing Authority. In eight years of operation in Darwin, the authority has injected $27.3 million on average each year into the local economy. The relative effect of direct and indirect Defence expenditure is expected to be maintained at around 10 per cent of the gross territory product from 1995 to 2001.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the features of APIN which impressed the subcommittee was the continued partnership with private industry in the design and construction of the facilities and amenities, and the associated tendering processes which are designed to encourage the participation of small as well as large contractors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Defence Housing Authority has also participated in successful joint ventures with private sector developers. The committee attended the opening of Fairway Waters, which was opened by my colleague the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Dondas), and the latest collaborative project at Palmerston, south&hyphen;east of Darwin, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5855"> which provides high quality housing for defence personnel as well as for private purchases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As one who at the time was a little critical of the founding of the Defence Housing Authority and a bit concerned about the role it would take, on each of the many projects I have seen I think the Defence Housing Authority has done a remarkable job in improving the quality of accommodation for the men and women of the Australian Defence Force and their families. Publicly, I would like to endorse them in the task they are pursuing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another area of major interest to the subcommittee during the northern visits program was the Army 21 review proposed blueprint for the Army of the 21st century. Members of the committee are critical that within the army there has been too little opportunity for dialogue between members of the services in a public way. We do not see that restructuring the army is something that needs to be confidential. It is something that would have benefited if it had been developed in a way which allowed all those interested to contribute to the debate rather than having it held in such close confine that few knew of its content, although there has been much speculation. This has not just been within the services but also within the media, and a lot of it has been about the directions to be proposed for Australia's army of the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of the ministerial defence policy statement in parliament on 15 October 1996, there is now an opportunity to know a little of the directions the government intends to take. The subcommittee would hope that it will shortly receive a briefing from officers of the Department of Defence on the content of this policy statement and would hope that, from that, there might be an opportunity not just for a parliamentary debate but also for a more open debate in the community generally about the directions that it should take. As one who has been involved in the services for many years, I think it is important that we look at it not only from the top down. In other words, it should not be a management exercise; we need to look at the role of the individual soldier.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I, for one, have been impressed by the way in which individual soldiers today are better qualified and more skilled. They make a very important contribution individually beyond that of some of their predecessors because of enhanced capacity&mdash;the greater firepower of weapons and technological equipment available to them. It is of concern to me that we do not just accept, for example, a nine&hyphen;man section in an infantry company of days gone by as being the necessary way to operate in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If individual soldiers are going to be more sophisticated in their capacity to deliver firepower, then we should be looking at the numbers within sections. We should not just be looking at the role of the individual soldier but at the role of the army itself. I trust all that will be taken into account within the Army 21 review. Aspects that relate to the performance of the soldier are at least as important as they are in the management of the personnel of the forces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other aspect I wanted to comment on briefly is the army reserves. I am concerned at the capacity of most individuals in today's work force to provide the 50&hyphen;day training that is to be expected of members of the general reserve. That is a big ask. It is going to make it extraordinarily difficult for many of those in the wider community who would like to contribute to the army reserves and participate. It worries me that it is going to be hard, but not because of the security of their employment. It is not a matter of giving them a guarantee of being able to get their jobs; it is a matter of their ability in relation to the work demands of the work force. Problems need to be addressed in that category.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5856"> In conclusion, I would like to thank the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan), and the military and civilian personnel of the Australian Defence Force, who assisted in ensuring the success of the subcommittee's familiarisation program, the first of this parliament. I would also like to thank the secretariat of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. I thank Joanne Towner, the secretary; Chris Lawson, who accompanied us on this mission; and Jane Vincent, who is on the Defence Subcom mittee. Each of them worked closely with defence personnel to develop a program of visits, briefings and inspections. These provide much valuable information about defence requirements and capabilities in northern Australia to subcommittee members and, through us, hopefully to the parliament. I commend the report to the parliament.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(12.47 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to endorse the remarks and contribution of the Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). I certainly did not disagree with anything he said. It is a feature of the operation of the Defence Subcommittee that members really do try to bring an honest view and adopt a bipartisan approach to the issues presented to them. I compliment all who have been involved in the tradition in the past and those presently serving for continuing it now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a few things I did want to comment on about this visit. I apologise if I go over some of the ground of the right honourable member for New England. It was really great that we were able to visit the 5th Aviation Regiment, which had been involved in the tragedy at Townsville. I compliment Colonel Tony Fraser, the commanding officer, and all members of the unit. We had a briefing. I was impressed with the honesty and sincerity of the briefing and the way all issues were openly presented without any questioning or probing. I can only commend them for the spirit and approach they are adopting following such a tragedy, which seared the nation as a whole. Not only us but all of Australia wish them well in rebuilding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were able to visit the 1st Division, which includes 6 RAR, the Ready Reserve component. I do not want to make any cheap points about the government. The government has made a decision to disband the Ready Reserve. When we went around, we were very impressed with the standard of the ready reservists and their commitment and motivation. I thought it was interesting that the officers were really impressed with the type of individual they are getting into the Ready Reserve. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What makes this perhaps more relevant today is that we are having calls for introducing national service. Following the remarks of the right honourable member for New England, I think the army is requiring a better educated, more adaptable, more flexible soldier&mdash;with no disrespect&mdash;rather than the cannon fodder that we have traditionally been used to in years gone by.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As you go around the community, you often hear the call, `Let's reintroduce national service.' On this visit, as with every other visit I have had the opportunity to have with the Defence Subcommittee, I have never once had an officer or a member of the services come up to me and say, `We need to reinstitute national service.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make a public request of the chairmen of our committee and subcommittee: in view of the popularity of this call, perhaps it would be worth while if we did have a short inquiry to look at whether national service is appropriate and whether the army's grave reservations about national service are well founded. The subcommittee could perform a useful task in putting that to bed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last but not least, I wanted to talk about Army 21, as this was raised previously. I congratulate the army for such a thoroughgoing review. I do not want to comment on the ministerial statement, but I do want to say thank you to the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan), as I understand he is undertaking to provide us with a copy of the important information available. I agree with the chairman of the committee that it is healthy for us to try to understand the concepts underpinning Army 21 and then have a debate about our respective views on the direction of the army. That ought to be mirrored into the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, I would like to say how much I appreciate&mdash;as I know other subcommittee members do&mdash;the opportunity to see serving men and women on their own territory, to speak frankly with them to gauge their concerns on the ground, and then come back to the parliament and report, as we are doing today.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I stand very briefly today to be involved in the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5857"> tabling of the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Defence Sub&hyphen;Committee: Visit to Queensland and the Northern Territory, 5&hyphen;8 August 1996</EMPHASIS> . It is an excellent report and it indicates the extent to which this parliament, particularly its committees, are involved in the area of defence, foreign affairs and trade. I want to particularly thank the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) for his comments about bipartisanship. It is very important, in this committee in particular, that we do exercise a very large degree of bipartisanship. As somebody who has been involved in this committee&mdash;this is my third parliament&mdash;I think that a very large measure of bipartisanship does exist and that the parliamentary processes and, hopefully, the Australian Defence Force is the better for that input.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to reiterate what both the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) and the member for Chifley have said about 5 Aviation Regiment and, in particular, the commanding officer, Colonel Tony Fraser. None of us could have been anything but impressed by the professionalism and the leadership that that officer exhibited when we were briefed so soon after the Black Hawk tragedy, which is still bouncing around the media and will continue to for some time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report itself does raise a number of broader issues in terms of the Ready Reserve. Decisions have been made by our government, and I strongly support the measure that we have taken. But it does have an implication for Army 21 and, as outlined in the ministerial statement delivered a couple of weeks ago, a lot of ground has to be covered in explaining what Army 21 involves. At the local level, I have yet to find out to what extent 49 RQR and 25 RQR are involved in the augmented or revised 6 Brigade with respect to that concept. I think Army 21 has a few potential pitfalls, but until such time as we are briefed in some detail it is very difficult to make a specific comment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to APIN, the Army Presence in the North, as somebody who was involved&mdash;as you have been, Mr Speaker&mdash;in the Public Works Committee, I can say that a very large amount of capital expenditure has been outlaid in establishing what is a great strategic <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> asset in the Darwin area. I am sure the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Dondas) will have something to say about APIN when he gets on his feet in a moment. Robertson barracks is a facility that is both functional and cosmetically pleasing. It is a facility which all members of the army, in particular, will be pleased with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Implicit in some of the comments contained in this report is the professionalism of the Australian Defence Force. Yes, the ADF has shortages. Yes, at times they are not able to meet their commitments. However, I am sure the right honourable member for New England and the member for Chifley would join with me in yet again congratulating the Australian Defence Force, including its senior hierarchy, in particular, General Baker who, as the Chief of the Defence Force over recent years, has shown a large measure of leadership under very difficult and trying conditions, particularly when it comes to the budget. It gives me pleasure to be involved&mdash;albeit briefly&mdash;in the tabling of this report, and I commend it to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Defence Sub-Committee: Visit to Queensland and the Northern Territory, 5&hyphen;8 August 1996</EMPHASIS>  tabled by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). It represents a very important development in defence for the Northern Territory. At the outset, Mr Speaker, I must advise you and other members of the House that I was unable to complete the whole tour with members of the Defence Subcommittee. I was able to do only the Northern Territory leg of the tour. Unfortunately, due to other commitments, I missed out on what were probably very interesting parts of the tour.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The visit to the Northern Territory was very important in view of the fact that there has been a tremendous build&hyphen;up by government over the past few years about defence facilities in the Northern Territory. The right honourable member for New England did say that the financial benefits to the Northern Territory are somewhat outstanding. In this 1996-97 budget an additional $2 million will be spent on infrastructure facilities in the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5858"> Northern Territory, on top of nearly $4 million that is currently being spent. It is estimated that the defence budget for the Northern Territory is in excess of $200 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are aware of other impending programs for the Northern Territory. I understand from the Chairman of the Public Works Committee, the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew), that the Public Works Committee has just visited Darwin and was able to evaluate some proposals that are being put to it by the department. I am aware of the upgrade of RAAF base Darwin, involving an expenditure in excess of $60 million, which will make that facility much more efficient, as there will be more space available, with infrastructure that will be able to get aircraft in and out much more quickly. There is also an upgrade at the Larrackeyah barracks on behalf of the navy at HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Coonawarra</EMPHASIS> where, if the Public Works Committee recommends that the money be spent, $20 million will be expended to increase the facility. I thought it was very important that our members were able to see and hear first-hand from the officers in Darwin who were involved in providing the briefings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to speak about Norforce in this regard. Norforce is a small military facility. Members were given a very good briefing by the commander of Norforce. We also had a briefing from APIN, the Army Presence in the North project. That gave members a comprehensive feeling for where we are going. We also had briefings from the headquarters of Northern Command, which is called Norcom.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other exciting project which will need to be evaluated in the near future is the army's decision to take over a property in a remote part of the Northern Territory, between Timber Creek and Kununurra, called Bradshaw Station. Bradshaw Station is being evaluated to see whether it will become a facility for tropical warfare training for the Australian Army. I am also led to believe that other countries which are interested in tropical warfare training will be invited to participate at that new training facility once it has been approved. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was very fortunate to have my colleagues from the Defence Subcommittee with me when I opened a joint facility at Palmerston, in Darwin, called Fairway Waters. I had invited my colleagues to attend the official opening of the joint housing venture between the Defence Housing Authority and the Delfin Property Group. Members were able to see first&hyphen;hand the type of accommodation that is now being built and supplied for our army people in the territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is very important to understand that people in the defence system need to have good housing if they are going to stay, especially in what one considers to be a remote area. I do not see Darwin as being a remote area, but somebody coming from Sydney or Melbourne may perceive it to be remote. The important thing is that the accommodation now being provided under this new joint venture is something that we as a government, the army as an organisation and Delfin as the joint venture partner can be very proud of. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make a small contribution to the tabling of this report by the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. Although I am in my third term in the parliament, it is the first time that my colleagues have given me the privilege of serving on this committee. I am delighted to be a member of the Defence Subcommittee as part of the overall committee. It is obviously a very good committee. I have enjoyed so far the way in which the committee is run. The committee secretariat is obviously very professional. So I am looking forward to my service on the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The four days or so that the Defence Subcommittee spent on its visit to Queensland and the Northern Territory was extremely valuable from my point of view. Although I am one member of the committee who has actually served in the army&mdash;and, indeed, one of two members in the place who have returned from active service&mdash;the army has changed a lot since I was in it in the late 1960s and early 1970s. However, as you get back into it, visit some of the bases and talk <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5859"> to some of the personnel, you see that some things have not changed a great deal. Certainly, this was a very important part of my re-education and reintroduction to the operation of the services. I enjoyed the four days very much and found them particularly helpful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan) for allowing us the use of the 34 Squadron aircraft. It was a very comfortable way to travel, but perhaps we should not dwell too much on that side of it. It also made the four days very productive because it allowed us to do in four days what we could not possibly have done otherwise. So that was very worth while and useful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that the committee is to visit other defence establishments. Our particular objective on these four days was to visit the establishments in Queensland and the Northern Territory. Of course, there are many other military establishments in Australia and I am looking forward to having the opportunity to visit those.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Could I also say how impressed I was by the reception we received from defence personnel, from senior officers down, in all of the three services. Each of them was well prepared for our visit, from Major&hyphen;General Ford down. In every place we went they were very well prepared for our visit, very cooperative and very pleased that we as members of the committee and members of parliament were actually on the ground to talk to them and to talk to soldiers and other ranks about what was going on in the areas in which they were involved. I mention that because it was very pleasing to be received and to have been so comprehensively briefed at every stop.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Chifley (Mr Price) and others have alluded to the Ready Reserve scheme. The government, in its policy for some time prior to the election, was committed to disbanding the Ready Reserve scheme. I believe that was the right decision, although I ought to say how impressed I was when I talked to ready reservists. They were very committed to the scheme. They had obviously benefited greatly from it. No doubt many people were disappointed by that decision. But I think the point emphasised by the minister in the speech he made the other day <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which was called `Restructuring the Australian Army and defence efficiency review' was that this would allow us to do what has been long overdue&mdash;that is, to put some real resources into the reserve. For a long time the reserve has been very much a second rate organisation. It has been underequipped. The decision to do away with the Ready Reserve will free up funds to enable the reserve to be brought up to strength and to increase the contribution that can be made by reservist soldiers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know from my own experience that there is nothing more frustrating than to be in the reserve, committed to it&mdash;and most of those who join the reserve are very committed to it&mdash;but to find the training is not available to the extent that it should be and that the equipment is not up to scratch. I think that will be a very worthwhile outcome of the decision to disband the Ready Reserve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to the member for the Northern Territory (Mr Dondas) how much I enjoyed the Northern Territory part of the visit. Darwin is a bit remote for most of us. The APIN project, the Army Presence in the North project, is going very well. Robertson barracks were excellent. That was one eye-opener for me, not having been around the army very much for many years&mdash;to see the change in the conditions that exist for soldiers these days. Their living conditions and the facilities that are available to them are excellent. Robertson barracks is a very fine asset for the defence services. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has come to my attention that recently quarantine has become very lax in Australia. Indeed, there seems to be a conspiracy to take away protection that has long been enjoyed. Perhaps this is in pursuit of the mythical `level playing field'. I have been very concerned. I know that the government is presently considering introducing New Zealand apples to Australia. New Zealand has a disease, fire blight, which is common throughout the world. It does not exist in Australia, and nowhere in the world where it exists has it ever been able to be eradicated. The reason New Zealand does not have a pear industry is that pears are particularly susceptible to it. If the disease gets into Goulburn Valley there is absolutely no doubt that it will wipe out our pear industry as well. I have been told recently by several people associated with the New South Wales markets that they believe New Zealand apples are coming to Australia illegally in containers packed behind a couple of rows of kiwi fruit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an indictment of AQIS that they are not in a position to inspect these containers. The reason for my bill is to make the government liable for any damage it does to Australian industry through neglect. Officers of the department who knowingly take action or fail to take action which cause damage to industry should be personally liable. The bill addresses the question of government liability. This should be of some comfort to the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen the government in recent times allowing in chicken meat, with its attendant risks. No-one can tell exactly what the risk is. I realise that there is no such thing as zero risk, but I believe that we should not take chances. In Western Australia, some growers recently imported canola seeds from New Zealand. This canola seed was passed by the quarantine service, but on planting it <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> produced several species of weeds not known in Australia, among them cleavers, redshank and field madder. All these weeds have a significant potential cost to the industry. Keeping them out should have been a priority. They are here now, however, and we now have the job of eradication. The government is beholden to making sure that farmers personally involved in this process are not personally out of pocket.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, we have Johnes disease of sheep, also introduced from New Zealand. At the moment it seems to be contained fairly well around the Orange district in New South Wales. It tends to be a disease of higher rainfall areas, but there are parts of Australia that we would certainly want to keep this disease out of and efforts should now be made to eradicate it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quarantine has been downgraded. Governments of all persuasions are now drawn to what they call `balancing the risk'. This is totally unacceptable. It is totally unacceptable to primary producers and it would damage Australia's `clean, green' image enormously. One of the big advantages we have overseas, and one of the assets we must protect, is our reputation for clean, green produce which is produced without resort to large amounts of herbicides and insecticides. A lot of our markets in Europe are particularly sensitive about this issue&mdash;far more so than Asia. I have said for a long time that the potential market for these commodities is much more likely to be in Europe than it is in Asia, if for no other reason than the cost factor and the enormous productivity of the Mekong River delta.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill I have introduced is highly reasonable and should be supported by this House. Hopefully, it will restore some semblance of integrity to the actions of AQIS and the government's actions with respect to AQIS. I seek leave to present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some two years ago I was visited by a group of people who said they represented the Sudanese ethnic group in Australia. They were educated and sophisticated people. We sat and talked. As many members of parliament would know, when people visit them for the first time one is quickly made aware of one's ignorance of the history and the current political situation of countries remote from Australia. I was quickly acquainted with the dreadful situation in Sudan, and hence I was moved to support my colleague the honourable member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson) and move the motion the House is to discuss today. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>Some two years ago I had my attention drawn to the efforts of Dr Biro, who was the UN Human Rights Special Rapporteur to Sudan, whose aim was to prepare a report for the United Nations on human rights in Sudan. After many problems and great difficulties associated with gaining access to Sudan, Dr <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Biro presented his report. I have a copy of his report, dated 1 February 1994, in the House with me today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Dr Biro in his visit to Sudan reported on many items. After reading them, one is quite moved to realise that there is such inhumane practice anywhere in the world today. He devotes part of his report to the examination of violations by the government of Sudan and analyses those violations in a number of areas, including extra juridical killings and summary executions. He mentions in his report enforced or involuntary disappearances, torture and other cruel, inhumane and degrading treatments. He documents conversations and evidence that he received whilst visiting Sudan of all these practices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dr Biro also enunciates the arbitrary arrest and detention provisions and the due process of law in that country. He mentions that the provision of penal legislation is inconsistent with international norms. He mentions and reports to the United Nations on slavery, servitude, slave trade, forced labour and similar institutions and practices. He reports on the lack of freedom of conscience and on some specific cases of violation of human rights of persons belonging to religious minorities. This is a huge report&mdash;covering some 40 or 50 pages&mdash;to the United Nations by a special investigator who, only after great effort, gained entry to some parts of Sudan but who was not able to gain access to all parts of Sudan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am indebted to Baroness Cox, a member of the British House of Lords, who provided further information. Baroness Cox is also a person who is deeply concerned, as are the Sudanese refugees in Australia, with human rights in Sudan. On a number of occasions and in a number of various roles, she has visited Sudan and has had conversations with people there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In reading the reports from Baroness Cox, one has to be aware that there is a continuation of all of the matters that were identified by Dr Biro for the United Nations. The evidence that Dr Biro established back in 1993 and 1994 continues in train today. The evidence is supported by the neighbouring country of Eritrea. I have in my possession a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5862"> statement by the Consulate of the State of Eritrea addressed to the House of Lords in the United Kingdom. It outlines the observance by Eritrea&mdash;which, goodness me, has an appalling enough background of its own&mdash;of the events in Sudan, its effort to establish a reasonable relationship with the government of Sudan and its failure to be assured that human rights are given any strength or given any acknowledgment in Sudan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Baroness Cox, in her visits to Sudan, has come forward with a number of recommendations which support those made by the United Nations, but these are more recent because the United Nations has not, since 1994, been allowed access to report on the affairs of Sudan. Baroness Cox reports on the continuing practice of the denial of human rights in Sudan. She says that the government of Sudan is continuing to transform by force the ethnically and religiously diverse country into an Arabic Islamic state against the wishes of the vast majority of black Africans. Estimates that she has had of the levels of genocide indicate that there could have been as many as 1.8 million children killed and a possible total death toll of over five million people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The institution of slavery is rife in Sudan. Slavery continues on a large scale supported, one would have to say, by the government of Sudan. Those sold into slavery are mainly women and young children who are forced into animal&hyphen;like conditions and sold as slaves to the highest bidder. Their families are&mdash;</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SD4">Mr CADMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And forcibly converted to Islam of a fundamentalist type, although I would have to say that this is not an entirely Islamic cause because there are moderate Islamic groups in Sudan that have felt the force of the government of Sudan which is fanatical in its interpretation of Islamic rule.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> There are raids taking place by Arabic forces on African towns. People are being locked in their houses and the houses set on fire. There is a story of one church congregation being locked in the church and the church set on fire. Everybody perished in that process. I have seen films of people who have <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> suffered burns from torture and mistreatment in the Nuba Mountains in southern Sudan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The cause is very significant. The Australian government has, over a period, carried out a worthwhile aid and support program. Our nation needs to go further. We need to be arguing in the United Nations&mdash;the Security Council has not yet decided on this issue&mdash;for a ban on the provision of arms to Sudan. I join with my colleagues in this House in suggesting that we need to move in that direction. We should also provide continuing support and continuing aid for the people of Sudan. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the motion. I speak in endorsement of the broad outline of this motion. With the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), I have had contact with the Sudanese community in Sydney. About 18 months ago they raised this matter with us very clearly. A previous motion which was suggested for debate in this House was never debated. This matter was also mentioned in the British House of Commons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had contact with the Reverend Dr Richard Rogers who runs a group called Light and Hope for Sudan. In recent months in Britain he has made very clear, by way of hunger strikes and other activities, the concern of the Church of England about the rights of Christians in Sudan. A lot of the international attention on the situation in Sudan has been heightened by the visit of the Archbishop of Canterbury to Sudan and his expose of some of the practices there in the past few years. It is not just the problems of the Christians, it is also the ethnic discrimination within the country, the enslavement of the Dinka and other people, and the attack on animus beliefs. It is not just a Christian&hyphen;Muslim issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5863"> Sudan has obtained a degree of international opprobrium. The United Nations has had to move against Sudan this year, mainly in the context of Sudan's refusal to extradite three terrorists who, it is thought, played a very crucial role in the attempted assassination of President Mubarak of Egypt during a visit to Khartoum. As a result, international diplo matic restrictions have been placed on travel arrangements of Sudanese government officials. There have been restrictions on air travel. From April onwards, they have had a diminished diplomatic status throughout most of the Western world, culminating in the air embargo. At the same time, Sudan is on the United States State Department's list of seven countries that are, as the United States would view it, involved in international terrorism. Another country on that list is Libya.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On an international front, there is concern about the degree to which they are, as a state, interfering in the internal affairs of a number of other countries not only in the Middle East but also in the Western world. There is a very clear involvement between them and Islamic fundamentalist forces in trying to overthrow the government of Egypt and, as I said, in the attempted assassination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only last week the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> contained a small piece detailing the latest outrages committed by this regime. The article, headed `Sexes segregated', stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Khartoum's State Council has imposed a law segregating the sexes in public places, including transport, political rallies and wedding parties. The law also bans women from going to markets unaccompanied by a "legitimate male companion"&mdash;a husband, brother or father&mdash;after nightfall.</PARA>
<PARA>That is typical of the attempt by the regime of Lieutenant&hyphen;General Omar Hassan Ahmad al&hyphen;Bashir to implement aspects of Sharia law, most fundamentally in restricting female rights. We are seeing an even more draconian indication of that in Afghanistan at the moment. There have been these aspects of religious restrictions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another article reports that the Beja people of north-eastern Sudan, which is basically a schismatic Islamic group, have been declared by the state and by the main ideologue of this regime, Hassan al&hyphen;Turabi, not to be Muslims. They have also been discriminated against&mdash;just like the mainstream Christian and animus groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people in the country are suffering from gross malnutrition and tuberculosis and there have been constant attempts by the government to restrict and harass aid organisations attempting to provide supplies. In the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> late 20th century the country has been identified with organised slavery&mdash;something that disappeared in most parts of the world a century or two ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of 21 June this year, taken from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Baltimore Sun</EMPHASIS>, talks of the efforts of two of that paper's reporters: Gilbert Lewthwaite and Gregory Kane. They wrote about buying two boys for $US500 each&mdash;the cash equivalent of five cows&mdash;from an Arab trader in a remote village. The article stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In their three&hyphen;part report, they wrote: "If we were Sudanese slaveholders, we might use such children for herding or for household chores in return for nothing but the crumbs from our table. We might give them Arabic names and convert them to Islam. We might use a girl for sexual pleasure, perhaps as a wife.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"But we are not Sudanese Arabs. We are visitors . . . and our mission is not to perpetrate slavery but to expose it."</PARA>
<PARA>The children, aged 10 and 12, who had been purchased had been seized from their father, an impoverished cereal farmer, six years earlier by government&hyphen;backed militia. Sudan&mdash;in addition to it destabilising Muslim fundamentalist terrorism and its interference in other countries&mdash;is internally suppressing religious and ethnic minorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, traditionally Sudan has taken a leading role in the enslavement of minority peoples, particularly the Dinkas. This is not just a minor sideline in the backblocks of the country where this might happen to go on because of a lack of central control; there is the involvement of the central government at the highest level. There have been very strong indications of the use of slaves by leading government officials, and it is characteristic of the leadership of the armed forces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As an indication that things are not getting any better, in the last month or so the Sudanese government has indicated the further centralisation of power in the country. As with many African nations, this country is subject to a degree of schismatic conduct by ethnic minorities and by regions. As part of the process of trying to get everyone on side at various stages, they conceded decentralised power to states. In the last month, however, they announced that they will abolish state <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5864"> assemblies and basically go back to a process of government appointment of all officials at a local level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since 1983, the SPLA, a group that has been waging a war against the government, has splintered. Whilst the people opposing the government have received a degree of support from Eritrea, Uganda and other players in the region because of the fears they have about Sudan's external operations, there is no doubt at the moment that the central government is militarily in a strong position. This is having repercussions throughout that region of Africa. Uganda has used the fears it has of Sudan to justify a 20 per cent increase in its defence budget. That is typical of what is happening in the region because of the continuation of this regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been estimated that one million people have been killed since 1983, and that billions of pounds have been spent in military operations. There have also been threats by President Bashir to invade Uganda. There have been occasions when Uganda's air space has been ignored.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I join with the member for Mitchell in saying that Australia must take a fairly strong position internationally on this regime. It is not just a few members of parliament and the United Nations which can make diplomatic deals; reputable international organisations such as Amnesty International can also assist. Amnesty has published yet another critical report to coincide with the anniversary of the 1989 coup. The report once more accuses Sudan of systematic and comprehensive abuse of human rights, citing incidents of slavery. Amnesty's conclusions have been repeated by other human rights agencies including Human Rights Watch and Christian Solidarity International.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I think this motion is important. Sudan is a country which does not get much coverage in Australia; it is not in a region within our direct influence. A growing presence of Sudanese citizens in Sydney have raised this matter with me and the member for Mitchell at a number of functions. Internationally, as we are seeing, there is concerted action being taken by the United States, in particular, and the United Nations to bring to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> world attention the concerns about this regime.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As has been indicated by the prior speaker, the honourable member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson), Sudan is not close to Australia, and certainly it is not within Australia's sphere of influence. But the fact that there are such appalling breaches of human rights in that country is reason for this parliament to speak out. Over the last few years attempts have been made in international forums to bring this outlaw government to heel. These attempts have not been as successful as one would have liked; therefore, more is needed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Through multilateral and bilateral contacts, this government has done whatever it can to bring about a better future for the people of Sudan. I would like to compliment the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer), and indeed the government, on what has been done to date. The government is committed to the universal protection of human rights and it deplores the abuse of human rights in Sudan and elsewhere. Unfortunately, though, these abuses go on day by day and year by year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the time that the current Sudanese government has been in power, about seven years, there has been a common thread running through its approach to its people. The common thread is the oppression of human rights. The government tends to polish its image from time to time, but the substance of its abuse remains.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Baroness Cox was referred to by the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman). This wonderful lady has been to the Sudan on many occasions. She does not hesitate to speak out; she does not hesitate to go and find the facts. On a recent visit to Sudan she represented Christian Solidarity International. The honourable member for Mitchell highlighted a number of the findings of the group from Christian Solidarity International, and I will mention some of them again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government of Sudan continues to try to transform by force the ethnically and religiously diverse country into an Arab Islamic state against the wishes of the vast majority of its population, both north and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5865"> south. The devastating effects of this policy in the south, in the Nuba Mountains, are tantamount to genocide. The report also refers to the mass displacement of the population of the south and the Nuba Mountains by means of aerial and ground attacks on civilians, slavery and the manipulation of humanitarian aid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Mitchell pointed out that many people have died, possibly about 1.5 million. Raids by the Sudanese army and by militias have taken place and, as a result of those raids, we have seen murder, torture, rape, looting, the destruction of property and the taking of slaves. The institution of chattel slavery is continuing unabated; indeed, it seems to have the support of the government of Sudan. The number of chattel slaves is estimated to be in the tens of thousands. In most cases the slaves are women and children, and they are forced to provide domestic and agricultural labour or to provide sexual services against their will for the provision of nothing but minimum food for survival. Generally they are forced to adopt the Muslim religion. I must say that I find it absolutely unacceptable that, in this day and age, we have a situation where slavery is endemic in Sudan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, when Baroness Cox was in Sudan she met some Arab traders and discussed the nature of their transactions. Apparently, the current average price required to redeem a slave is three cows. This is trade in people&mdash;totally unacceptable in 1996. The traders claimed that this price was necessary to cover the costs of finding children, abduction and purchase. Also many people have lost their families and have gone all over the country to find them. In some cases they have bought their families back only to have them stolen again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> I strongly support the motion before the House. It is about time the international community took a very firm line on the Sudan. The conduct in that country is woeful, it is totally unacceptable and it is about time that we brought this government to heel. This motion must be implemented. We cannot have slavery, torture, murder, rape and sharia&mdash;Islamic law&mdash;imposed on non&hyphen;Islamic citi zens. It is about time the world stood up and did something positive. It is about time that this outlaw government was rejected by international society.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That this House expresses its concern about the high level of concentration of media ownership in Australia and current threats to what limited diversity remains, and urges the Government to resolutely oppose any changes which would narrow the structure of ownership even further.</PARA>
<PARA>Freedom of speech is an issue of intense debate in our community at present. The shallowness of this debate, which, I have to say, has been encouraged by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), is exposed when issues about the ownership and control of Australia's media, our vehicles for the expression of ideas, are examined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For, in a country in which the Prime Minister claims to be one which encourages openness and freedom of expression, we have one of the highest concentrations of media ownership in the world. This concentration of ownership already poses a serious threat to the diversity of opinion and comment in our democracy and so also to our freedom of speech.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Australia this limited diversity is no more clearly underlined than in the ownership of our capital city and national daily newspapers. In Australia newspapers are a vital part of the national debate in public affairs, politics, religion, sport or almost any other area you care to name. Yet they are controlled by a tiny group of people. The prime example is Rupert Murdoch's News Ltd which owns capital city dailies in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Hobart and Darwin, as well as owning the national daily the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5866"></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KG4">Mr LANGMORE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And Super League. That's right. Of these cities, News Ltd has a monopoly in Brisbane, Adelaide, Hobart and Darwin. The combined circulation of News Ltd papers give it an extraordinary 67 per cent of the total daily circulation of capital city newspapers in Australia&mdash;a high level of dominance. The fact that this potential for influence is in the hands of an American citizen makes the situation even more disturbing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Concentration of ownership is also a major concern in a number of other areas. In the publication of magazines, Kerry Packer's PBL group controls 47 per cent of the total circulation of major magazines in Australia, Rupert Murdoch's News Ltd controls 26 per cent and Mr Murdoch's nephew, Matt Hambry, owns over eight per cent. Together these three individuals control over 80 per cent of the top 30 magazines sold in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In television the three major networks are controlled by corporations which are also powerful in other parts of the media&mdash;News Ltd in the case of the Seven Network; the Canadian group, TNQ, in the case of the Ten group; and by a 100 per cent shareholding by Kerry Packer's PBL in the case of the Nine Network.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the situation in radio ownership remains slightly more open, new threats to diversity are also emerging in the rapidly expanding technologies of cable television and other multimedia services. Control of Super League is an example of an extension into another area which also involves potential dominance. The reason why this concentration of ownership is of great concern is the constraint it imposes on diversity. Diversity of information and ideas in Australia is already very limited and any arguments that suggest there is choice in news and opinion provided by the privately owned media is clearly confusing diversity with multiplicity. Diversity is crucial for the health of democracy and variety of opinion is the key to maintaining a healthy debate about ideas and about the future of our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Prior to the election, the coalition announced that it would hold a public inquiry into the issues of media control and owner ship. This undertaking was welcomed as a positive step in establishing a clearer vision of the future of media ownership in Australia. Unfortunately, after the election the coalition government chose not to pursue this initiative and has instead opted for an in&hyphen;house departmental inquiry. This backdown by the government is of great concern for it indicates an unwillingness to comprehensively address the maze of issues surrounding media ownership and control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The failure of governments over the past two decades to adequately address this issue is the principal reason behind the narrowing of diversity and the increased concentration of control we face today. A public inquiry would have opened up the debate. It would have allowed a wide variety of submissions and information from across the community and it would have provoked a wider awareness of issues surrounding media ownership in Australian society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In raising this issue, it is important to remember that in October 1991, 133 members and senators in this place signed a petition to the then Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, urging him to oppose the sale of the Fairfax group to any individual or consortium which would result in a reduction of diversity and a greater concentration of ownership. I seek leave to table that petition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KG4">Mr LANGMORE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This petition was organised in a bipartisan manner by me and the former member for Bradfield, David Connolly. It is interesting to note that amongst the signatories were the present Prime Minister, the present Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston), the present Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the now Leader of the House (Mr Reith). These people supported the need for diversity then. They should certainly continue to do so now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Questions as to what diversity in our media should mean in practice and how it can be distinguished from multiplicity, which is often mistaken as the same thing, would have been a key point of examination in a public inquiry and, in the current debate about freedom of speech, would have done much to broaden <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5867"> and deepen the discourse. Equally, the issue of foreign ownership and control&mdash;an issue of which a great many people in the community feel deeply concerned&mdash;could have been addressed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) was about to propose a new tax on cats! This is a government which talks a lot about families but does very little to help them. A number of families in south&hyphen;west Sydney are suffering from the government's mishandling of the second Sydney airport issue. The proposed Holsworthy site would not only hurt people in the future; it is hurting them now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Take the case of the young couple who were building their first home at Long Point in my electorate. At the time of the government's announcement about Holsworthy earlier this year&mdash;when they threw 10 years of planning right out the window&mdash;that young couple was living in a garage with their home half finished. Today, sadly enough, they are still living in a garage and their home is still half finished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They cannot afford to take the risk of building the second half of their home as Long Point, the building site, is just a stone's throw away from the Holsworthy airport site and its proposed runways just on the other side of the Georges River. This government and its madcap decision about Holsworthy have turned that young couple's Australian dream into a nightmare. So much for a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5868"> government committed to family values. So much for helping battlers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, I plead with the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp), for this and many other reasons, to abandon his plans for Holsworthy and give back the certainty, the security and the amenities the people of south&hyphen;west Sydney need in their lifestyles and for their families' aspirations.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday I happily attended a function outside my electorate involving some very prominent members of my electorate. A fundraising event of a few weeks ago resulted in several thousand dollars in cash being donated to the Mater Children's Hospital and also to the Royal Children's Hospital in Brisbane.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This good work was the result of members of the Queensland Chinese Forum and the Valley Business Association working together at the Mid&hyphen;Autumn Festival a few weeks ago. To Bill Qui, Jimmy Mak, Michael Choi&mdash;who is the President of the Valley Business Association&mdash;Peter Yeoh, Peter Low and so many others I take some moments in this place to offer congratulations on their efforts and also on the fact they have been directing their fundraising to causes which will benefit the broad community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The money going to those worthwhile causes is yet more money in addition to the amounts which they have extended in the last few years&mdash;$40,000 is one estimate and others put it much higher. As Sister Angela Mary from the Mater Hospital said, it is a great pity there are some who are bagging members of the Chinese community in a generalist way and turning their back on the good works which so many people of Asian origin have done in the broad community.

I was initially disillusioned and now I am quite alarmed at the continuing failure by the Prime Minister to unambiguously condemn those remarks. The Prime Minister had the ability by virtue of his office to motivate the entire country into condemning the unnecessary possession of guns.

Just yesterday a very prominent Thai, Senator Mechai Viravaidya, publicly denounced Ms Hanson's comments and stated that her comments have caused enormous damage to Australia's reputation in the region. We have a $721 million a year trade surplus with Thailand.

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Lindsay for her question. I take this opportunity to say that one of the many factors that contributed to her re-election was the persistent and frequent way she represented the interests of her constituents in question time before the by-election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The agreement reached between the Australian Democrats and the government regarding the workplace relations bill is an important agreement. It is historic, and I wish to place on record my personal thanks and those of the government for the outstanding job that has been done by the Minister for Industrial Relations not only in devising the legislation and in advocating the need for the legislation but also in the patient, intelligent and persistent way which he negotiated with the Australian Democrats. Over a period of some 50 or 60 hours, these negotiations have produced a piece of legislation which, although it will contain a number of changes from that originally introduced into parliament, will nonetheless honour the five principal criteria that I laid down for acceptability of industrial relations legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will first and foremost sweep away Laurie Brereton's job destroying unfair dismissal laws. Secondly, it will entrench forever the principle of voluntary association in Australia. No longer will Australian workers have compulsory unionism rammed down their throats. Thirdly, it will provide an effective choice between an industrial award and a workplace contract. Fourthly, it will enable unionists who want to join trade unions to join the trade union of their choice. Not only are we entrenching the principle of voluntary unionism; we are entrenching the principle of choice as to the type of union the individual worker will join. Finally, it restores effective secondary boycott legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it does honour those five principles. It does contain amendments to take care of the concerns that were expressed by the Australian Democrats. On behalf of the government, I want to acknowledge the constructive contribution of the Australian Democrats towards the negotiating process. I want to acknowledge the constructive, pragmatic, intelligent way in which discussion of this <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> legislation was addressed. The way in which the minister and the Leader of the Australian Democrats were prepared to sit down over a long period of time to negotiate away differences and to reach agreement with each holding to their principles I think reflects considerable credit on both of them. I say on behalf of the government that we certainly acknowledge the contribution that has been made by the Australian Democrats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the most interesting reaction to this legislation is the extraordinarily confused reaction of the Australian Labor Party. I search in vain for a consistent thread. The only thread is the thread of the sour loser. There is no consistent thread, but I suppose the most interesting comment was made by the man from the Carnegie Institute over here, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. He had this to say when he was door&hyphen;stopped this morning, `There are many ways in which the position of the trade unions has been weakened.' He went on to say, `The capacity to engage in particular kinds of industrial action has been undermined.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you throw out the Gareth&hyphen;speak, what he is really doing is complaining that it is going to be harder to strike. That is really what he is saying. Is that all you have to say? Don't you look at the enormous advances for individual workers under this legislation? Don't you look at the way in which this legislation will create a greater climate of cooperation at the workplace? Don't you understand that, after 13 years of the dead hand of your industrial relations system, we now have an industrial relations system that does not enshrine the role of one or other side of the industrial bargain but enshrines the objective of a more productive, a more competitive and therefore a more rewarding Australian society?</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

Do not talk to us about jobs when your policy holds a sword of Damocles over the jobs of 220,000 young people.

What factors have led to these positive rate movements and what are the benefits for Australian home buyers and the holders of variable rate home loans?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="5873" SPEAKER="Costello, Peter, MP" NAMEID="CT4" ELECTORATE="Higgins" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Treasurer" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Kingston for her question. I know that she, representing the electorate that she does, is concerned about home buyers who had to experience the interest rate increases of late 1994 under the Labor administration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When this government came to office, the variable mortgage rate was 10.5 per cent. It is now 9.25 per cent. In an attempt to narrow differential with mortgage managers, the major trading banks first reduced their variable mortgage rate from 10.5 to 9.75 per cent; and in July of this year the Reserve Bank of Australia cut the official cash rate by 0.5 percentage points, with the banks following in August, taking mortgage loans down to 9.25 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For a person on an average mortgage of $100,000, the 1.25 percentage point reduction in the variable interest rate represents a saving of $104 a month. For someone on adult average weekly earnings, this is equivalent to an increase in before tax income of $160 a month. The variable mortgage rate is paid in after tax income. There is no better benefit that home buyers can be given than a reduction in their mortgage interest rates. That 1.25 percentage point reduction in the variable rate since June and July illustrates for somebody on average weekly earnings $160 a month pre&hyphen;tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week, Aussie Home Loans announced that its variable home loan interest rate would be reduced from 8.65 per cent to 7.99 per cent. FAI announced a reduction in its rates from 8.45 per cent to 7.95 per cent. This illustrates the benefits to the community of competition. This illustrates that new players enter the market aggressively seeking competition. With lower costs, they do have the ability to deliver direct benefits to consumers.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5874">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Westpac announced, in response, a reduction in its first option home loan from 8.4 per cent to 7.89 per cent last week. That indicates that competition in the home loan market does have the capacity to lower margins in relation to mortgages and give real benefits to consumers. This is consistent with the government's aim of producing a low inflation economy. This is an aim that is backed up by a responsible fiscal policy. This is an aim that is backed up by movements in relation to wages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In recent times, we have seen some unions threatening to pursue unsustainable wage increases. Let me make it clear that, in a low inflation environment, wages do not have to chase prices. If prices are under control, wage outcomes can be moderated accordingly. Moderate wage outcomes, low price increases and lower interest rates are all consistent with a sustainable growth economy in which opportunities and certainty for business investment can be created and benefits can be delivered to consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We indicated during the election campaign that we were committed to Australian families. Delivering reductions in mortgage interest rates is part of this government's commitment to Australian families, part of the benefits that will come through to them through a responsible economic program.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me make it entirely clear that the government has a strategy in place to reduce interest rates. That strategy is a low inflation environment.

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question and acknowledge his interest in workplace relations policy. I am very pleased to be able to say to the House that, on any fair appraisal of what we have done, the government has been able to secure passage of the legislation, which means that we have kept faith with the Australian people on the basis of the undertakings and the commitments that we took to the election on 2 March.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To echo the remarks of the Prime Minister, we have been able to do so because we have had a very constructive process with the Australian Democrats in looking at the government's proposals. It has been a very extensive process, with something in the order of 60 hours of discussions. From my perspective, one of the good things about the discussions is that, all through the process, Senator Kernot and Senator Murray have been prepared to say, `Give us an explanation of the reasons for what you are proposing.' They have allowed us to explain what we are doing. Furthermore, where they have had concerns, they have responded to us by saying, `If you have got a worry, can you tell us exactly what the worry is so that we can address it?' That has meant that, in the package which we have now come to, there are 171 amendments. All through that process we have attempted to address the concerns and, at the same time, maintain the integrity and the thrust of the proposals that we originally put.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at some of the matters which the Prime Minister has spoken about, he did <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5876"> make a number of commitments in recent times as to what we thought were core elements. In addition to those was our commitment that people would not be worse off as a result and that people would not be disadvantaged by the processes. We have secured a fair no disadvantage test and also a flexible one which I think gives substance to that undertaking. We have, of course, gone further and also met the other matters he raised. It is great that we can scrap Laurie Brereton's unfair dismissal scheme. If employees do have a problem with unfair dismissal, we have a scheme which is fair to employees as well as to employers. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to Australian workplace agreements, I think we now genuinely have a user friendly system that is going to be practical, whether you are running a small business or a big business or whether you are an employee. Those agreements can be collective or individual. The good thing is that, if you are not in a union and you do not want a union to be involved in your agreement, you will not have a union foisted upon you telling you what you can and cannot do. Of course, that is provided that that agreement meets a fair set of minimum conditions by way of the no disadvantage test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also said that it was a key point of our bill that the freedom of association provisions would be retained. I am very pleased to be able to say to the House that the law as it will now be passed will abolish compulsory unionism. That is important for its practical benefits to people, but it is also important as a basic civil liberty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister is also on the record as saying it is important that if people want to form an enterprise union they should have the capacity to do so. With the replacement of the `conveniently belong' rule and the changes we have made, we can genuinely say to people, provided there are 50 to form the minimum number for that union, that the way is clear for enterprise unions to really take off in Australia, as employees so decide that it is in their interests to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another matter which has had a lot of public prominence, not just in Australia but internationally, has been the question of the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reinstatement of sections 45D and E. In this area, the public position of the opposition parties is that there should be provisions against secondary boycotts, but when they changed the secondary boycott provisions they made them ineffective. So we have not had in this country a debate on whether or not we should have provisions against secondary boycotts; rather, we have had a more subtle debate as to whether they should be effective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The existing Labor provisions put in by Mr Brereton are clearly ineffective and that is why it was very important that we reinstate 45D and E into the Trade Practices Act. We have responded to the concerns of the Democrats about consumer and environmental groups. We are therefore proposing to exempt consumer and environmental boycotts from the trade practices provisions but&mdash;and this is a very important `but'&mdash;not where industrial action is involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think on any fair assessment the policy that we took to the election has been delivered. We have done it in a way which has fairly recognised the concerns raised with us by the Democrats. With regard to some other issues, for example, the member for Kingston raised with me the question of the equal pay provisions. We have made that change to revert to the existing status quo, with some very minor modification. So we have recognised concerns and we have taken and accommodated issues that have been raised with us. For the benefit of this country, we now have a fair bill, a bill which will provide significant change and ultimately meet the title of our policy, which was better pay for better work.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I say in answer to the honourable member for Oxley that I think the current level of foreign aid by Australia is appropriate. I think this is an important question and I think the honourable member is entitled, like any other honourable member, to ask questions in this parliament, and I will endeavour to answer it as comprehensively as I can. I think the present level of foreign aid is right, both in terms of Australia's national interest and in terms of the humanitarian obligations which this country has, as a relatively wealthy country amongst the nations of the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to national service, I have always taken the view, and my party has long taken the view, that it would be appropriate to reintroduce national service in this country of a military kind if there were such a military threat or a change in Australia's strategic circumstances as would warrant its introduction. I have never believed that it is appropriate to use the armed forces of Australia for purposes other than the defence of Australia or as an aid to the civilian power. That is a longstanding principle which I think has been followed by both sides of parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand why, in times of difficulty&mdash;in particular, in areas of economic and social difficulty in Australia&mdash;some Australians would look suspiciously upon the provision of foreign aid. The other side of the coin is that there are many countries that receive foreign aid from Australia whose living standards are absolutely appalling by any measure. There are other countries whose relations with Australia are important and therefore the provision of foreign aid to those countries not only carries a humanitarian component but also is in Australia's national interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is equally true that on occasions Australians legitimately feel that foreign aid is sometimes not as effectively used as it might be. I can understand the anger in that. I can understand the anger of Australians who give money voluntarily to great organisations like World Vision and so forth, seeing the political perfidy of regimes in different parts of the world which allows that aid to be literally wasted on the wharves, airports and railway <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sidings of countries whose citizens are suffering appalling deprivation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I would say to the honourable member for Oxley and, through her, to those of her constituents and, indeed, the constituents of any other honourable member who feels that somehow or other foreign aid is being wasted, that I think in the long run that is a short&hyphen;sighted, mistaken view. I do think that this country has some moral obligations. There is also a national interest for Australia involved in the provision of foreign aid. Who could argue that the economic, social and strategic stability of Papua New Guinea is other than of immense significance to Australia? Who could argue that the stability of many other countries around the world which may receive assistance from Australia is not important?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the honourable member's question does place an obligation on governments and all political parties to make absolutely certain that foreign aid is directed in the most efficient manner, that there is political pressure applied to those countries that have intolerable regimes, who use starvation and the wasting of civilian populations as a method of achieving ends. The shameful record of regimes in Africa on this stands as an absolute blot upon the performance of governments around the world. We should never be reluctant to condemn that sort of behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can understand the feelings of Australians who think that their taxes are wasted in relation to aid to those countries. But the answer is not to turn our back on foreign aid; the answer is to try to get a more effective aid delivery system and an aid delivery system that returns optimum benefits to the Australian people while discharging our humanitarian obligations.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK></QWN>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Is the minister aware of reactions to the announcement yesterday of the agreement between the government and the Australian Democrats on the coalition's IR package?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="5878" SPEAKER="Reith, Peter, MP" NAMEID="WI4" ELECTORATE="Flinders" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Industrial Relations" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Fairfax for his question and for his interest in the subject matter as well. There has been a very positive reaction to the agreement which was announced yesterday. The principal employer organisation, the ACCI, has issued a statement welcoming the changes. We have had support from the National Farmers Federation welcoming the changes. The Farmers Federation said that it believes that the reforms in the workplace relations bill will make a significant contribution to improved performance in a number of key sectors, including meat processing and the waterfront, and will ultimately generate increased employment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been a large number of editorials on the subject, by and large favourable&mdash;not in every case, but by and large reasonably favourable. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Overall, however, Mr Reith is right when he says the Government has retained the integrity, the direction and the thrust of the bill. And the fact that this much has been achieved is to be applauded . . . </PARA>
<PARA>We also had in the editorial of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS>  the comment that the government:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . has secured a major advance in the government's program to reshape the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coalition pledge to reform the industrial relations landscape and, in particular, the unworkable unfair dismissal laws that have contributed to a paralysis in small business, is a policy the nation has waited too long to see enacted.</PARA>
<PARA>We have had semi-supportive comments even from Robert Fitzgerald of ACOSS. We appreciate the support that has been voiced in the last 24 hours on these changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is interesting, I suppose from the point of view of historical curiosity more than anything else, is the reaction that we have had <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> from the labour movement in the last few days. It is a bit hard on some occasions to work out which is the organ grinder and which is the monkey. It seems that the ACTU's stance on the government's package has been an evolving one. Members might remember that before the election on 2 March the prospect was of world war 3&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Bill Kelty declared war, and then we had a minor skirmish of a riotous nature outside Parliament House. Then I was down in the old Parliament House&mdash;I suppose we are lucky they did not tear down the doors of that building too&mdash;a week ago with Mr Kelty. I heard him say that he had been around for a long time and he had seen these ministers all come and go, each with their little packages. In other words, this was just another package, basically irrelevant to the union movement and therefore something to be put aside. That line was repeated by Jennie George, when she claimed that the amendments agreed with the Democrats had neutered the bill. She basically took the credit for it, which was pretty incredible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the union position is half-smart, semi-sophisticated&mdash;forget the system, ignore the law and remember only this: there will always be a union. Doubtless those union delegates in Melbourne today, who would be preening themselves on the 45 per cent group travel discount they got from Ansett to come across from Perth, will take this message back to their headquarters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has also been interesting is the other part of the duo. It seems that the position of the political arm of the labour movement has been evolving as well. Nowhere has the evolution of the ALP's position, slowly adapting itself to the position of permanent opposition, been more interesting than in the case of industrial relations. The shadow minister's initial response to the media was to announce that there was a major problem with the agreement but that he would get back to them after he had worked out what it was. I was not surprised at this because the shadow minister announced that it was a tawdry little agreement. The interesting thing is that he declared it at 2.30, before the agreement had <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5879"> even been released. I know we all had trouble with daylight saving yesterday, but to be literally hours off the pace is even more than your usual effort. We wait with bated breath to see what the shadow minister might have to say.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The interesting thing, seriously, is that the evolution of the political wing of the Labor Party since 2 March is not to hang on to the policy position they had on 2 March but to regress back through the 1990s, back through the 1980s, back into the 1970s. I will give the House one example to finish. The Labor Party in government, recognising the problem we might have with junior wage rates, proposed and implemented an extension of the exemption. Yet when they are in opposition the good sense of their earlier move is now beyond them. They are oppositionist for the sake of being in opposition.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

Won't new apprentices under that award, therefore, be up to $90.45 worse off each week in terms of their take home pay?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Will the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5880"> changes to the coalition's industrial relations package still have the effect of overturning the so-called Brereton unfair dismissal laws, which have cost jobs and made employers wary of engaging new employees?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="5880" SPEAKER="Reith, Peter, MP" NAMEID="WI4" ELECTORATE="Flinders" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Industrial Relations" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Hughes for her question. We are scrapping Laurie Brereton's unfair dismissal law. Goodbye, Laurie! In the small business community, whether you are an employer or employee, people from one end of the country to another will be applauding the end of your system, Laurie. No-one now has the record you have, Laurie. You created a solution for a problem that did not exist and gave us a bigger problem than that which we had to start with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The provisions did arouse enormous community hostility and they certainly cost a lot of Australians their jobs and job opportunities. They bogged down a lot of businesses in very costly legal disputes. The provisions, essentially, as history records, were the result of a failed attempt to use constitutional heads of power as a political tool for overriding traditional state unfair dismissal jurisdictions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first and most important feature of the new system is that it will be based on the principle of a fair go all round. That principle is a tried and tested principle. It has been in operation, for example, in New South Wales for some time now. We know it is a fair system, that it works reasonably and that it works in the interests of both employers and employees. Again, I must say I find it absolutely amazing that the Labor opposition is still opposed to fixing up the unfair dismissal laws in a reasonable way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The new system also incorporates a filing fee to be lodged with an application. We are proposing a $50 filing fee. I think that is fair and reasonable. We also have a provision which will allow for the payment of costs where there is found to be by the Industrial Relations Commission a vexatious application. During that process, parties will be properly informed of the position so that they are not in any way ill informed about the processes and the consequences of taking any particular action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The other change that we made&mdash;this certainly came up in the agreement&mdash;was to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> require all of these applications to start in the Industrial Relations Commission. I think that is a sensible change that we made during the process of discussions. The reason that I think it is sensible to have it in the Industrial Relations Commission is that the commission is dealing with the commercial realities of business on a day-to-day basis. It does have a feeling for the way in which workplaces are organised and what is a fair thing within a business when it comes to an unfair dismissal. This is a far better scheme. It is the scheme that should have been introduced originally. It is to the undying shame of the Labor Party that they let Laurie Brereton into unfair dismissals.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On this matter only. What we have done is that junior wage rates will be exempted from the anti age discrimination requirements of the act for a further three years from 22 June 1997.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we have not just left it there, acknowledging the concerns that the Democrats have had about this issue. We have agreed that the full bench of the Industrial Relations Commission will, within a couple of years, report on the feasibility of the replacement of junior wage rates with non-discriminatory alternatives. The full bench is to be convened by the president of the commission. It is to report <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not later than one year before the expiry of the exemption; so  that is within two years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report is to include assessments of whether it is desirable to replace junior rates with non-discriminatory alternatives; the consequences for youth employment of an abolition of junior rates; and the utility of junior rates for different types of employment for different industries and in the school&hyphen;to&hyphen;work transition. The act will also empower the commission to extend the exemption on an award-by-award basis in accordance with the guidelines that are established by the full bench of the commission convened by the president. That is a fair response to our concerns. So we have the exemption continued on for three years. Beyond the three years, we have a process which would allow that exemption to be granted basically on an award-by-award basis. We will have a much more considered and measured appreciation and analysis of the issue in the meantime. I dare say it is a debate that we will return to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I do think, though, is that the Labor Party ought to be reconsidering its position on this. It is not right that, whilst we have youth unemployment at the very high levels it is, a major political party in this country should still be proposing, as they intend to in the Senate in the next few days, that junior wage rates be abolished.

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member also for his question. This is a very significant issue. As I said in an earlier answer, it is not really a debate about whether or not we should have provisions against secondary boycotts but whether or not they should be effective. They clearly have not been. We had sections 45D and 45E in the Trade Practices Act at the initiative of the now Prime Minister. In those years leading to Labor's repeal of those provisions, we did actually have one effective remedy; and that was 45D and 45E. For that reason, we are very keen to get those provisions back.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were happy to meet the concerns of the Democrats in respect of consumer and environmental protection. It was never our intention to have those groups caught up in an <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> essentially industrial issue. For that reason, they were then happy to ensure that the exemption was qualified so that it was not inclusive of where industrial action is involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have section 45DB back in the Trade Practices Act. Not many members will remember&mdash;some may&mdash;that that provision was actually introduced in regard to the live sheep trade back in the 1970s. We were keen to see that measure&mdash;which essentially relates to primary boycotts&mdash;return because, I suppose, it reflects our belief that some of these boycotts are inimical to the achievement of an internationally competitive economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes to the enforcement and remedies provisions will, I think, promote the more effective settlement of boycott disputes by recognising the role of conciliation in industrial tribunals and ensuring the court has regard to that role when exercising its jurisdiction, which is in conformity with the practice of the courts, as I understand it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a lot of focus in the public debate about the changes announced yesterday, but the full picture includes a look at the original bill to see those measures which have not been changed and which are retained in the legislation. The bill also retains a range of other measures designed to provide more effective remedies for unlawful industrial action, some of which will be strengthened by the package announced recently. For example, the commission will be required to deal as quickly as practicable with an application for an order to stop or prevent unlawful industrial action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The more general point I would make is that the level of industrial action in Australia compared with most of our competitors is in fact far too high. For years the Australian community was told by the previous Labor government that the number of disputes was coming down, as if that in itself was a good thing. Obviously the level of industrial disputes falling over some time from the early 1980s to the beginning of the 1990s in itself was positive. But that is not the full story. We really need to look at what happened in the last year or so.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that the number of industrial disputes in the last period of the previous Labor government increased by 50 per cent. But even more damning is the fact that the level of industrial disputes in Australia compared with our international competitors is very high indeed. The last time I saw the figures in the UK, for example, the number of working days lost per 1,000 employees was about 14, but in Australia today the number is closer to 70, 80, 90 or 100. So honourable members can see that the level of disputation in Australia is very high, and that is why it is important that we have a much clearer definition of the circumstances in which people can take protected action, and a clearer definition, therefore, of the consequences for those who are taking action outside of that clearly defined regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other side of the coin is that, by vastly improving the agreement making processes, we are also giving people an incentive to undertake better bargaining. That is an essential ingredient for more harmonious, cooperative attitudes to work. If we can get more harmonious attitudes to work, not only do we get the number of disputes down but, on the other side of the coin literally, we get better productivity, more jobs and higher living standards through higher wages. And that, Mr Speaker, is our objective.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<ANSWER PAGE="5883" SPEAKER="Fischer, Tim, MP" NAMEID="DG4" ELECTORATE="Farrer" PARTY="NP" MINISTERIAL="Trade; Deputy Prime Minister" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DG4">Mr TIM FISCHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I thank the member for Macquarie for his question. I must say it is not only the exporters in the Macquarie electorate but those right across Australia who will benefit from the excellent outcome achieved by the Minister for Industrial Relations. I congratulate the Minister for Industrial Relations for putting together this agreement with the Commonwealth govern <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5884"> ment and the Australian Democrats which will facilitate the passage of this key legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I particularly refer to several key points. Sections 45D and 45E on secondary boycotts, which are extremely important, have been covered by the Minister for Industrial Relations. There is also section 45DB&mdash;boycotts affecting trade or commerce. I am pleased to say there are provisions involving the movement of goods affecting overseas trade and commerce in that regard, so we can quite properly and accurately continue to promote Australian exporters as reliable exporters, and there are proper arrangements in the industrial relations legislation with regard not only to secondary boycotts under 45D and E but also to 45DB on the matter of primary exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also contend and submit to the House that much greater flexibility will flow from the agreement between the Commonwealth and the Democrats on the workplace relations bill. The authorised workplace agreements will be a whole lot better than the fixed award structure with all its complexity and convolution whereby in Collins Street, Melbourne and various other capital cities the industrial relations club laid down a very formal, ritualistic approach a long way removed from reality, more often than not, on what was actually happening in the workplace in rural and regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is an enormous breakthrough for providing greater flexibility and, as a consequence, generating greater exports. As the Prime Minister says, the abolition of Labor's unfair dismissal law is long overdue for building confidence with employers on a fair basis to go out and create the additional jobs in small business, whether they are in Springwood, Victoria or beyond, Manilla near Tamworth or Carnegie in Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am reminded of the last two places because I notice the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has returned from his latest trip overseas. Glenn Milne was quite correct this day but, in fact, Glenn Milne did not quite go far enough because the quiet fury of your front bench at your trip in the immediate week after the budget was even more so than at your trip to Washington for the Carnegie Institute, when you went off to Manila in the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Philippines, which is a long way from Manilla near Tamworth, and vacated your responsibilities as shadow minister and as shadow Treasurer.

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8E4">Dr WOOLDRIDGE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. The incidence of food poisoning is actually rising worldwide. The recent epidemic of haemolytic uraemic syndrome in Japan where 9,000 people were affected is a fairly timely reminder of both the social and economic devastation that can result from food&hyphen;borne disease. Australia, of course, is not immune. We had the Garibaldi incident last year and this year the recall of peanut butter due to salmonella poisoning. I think there is cause for concern but there is certainly no cause whatsoever for panic. It should be remembered these represent a very tiny fraction of the total volume of foodstuffs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are three things under way that will help in this area. The first is, surprisingly, Australia has no national data on food&hyphen;borne illness. We can extrapolate from US data and, if you do that on a per capita basis, it could be suggested that 630 people die each year as a result of food poisoning. But, clearly, we need our own data. Discussions are under way with the Australia&hyphen;New Zealand Food Authority to establish a national database on the incidence of food&hyphen;borne disease. The Australia&hyphen;New Zealand Food Authority and the Australia&hyphen;New Zealand Food Council actually have a scheduled meeting tomorrow and this is one of the items that they hope to progress there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second area where there is progress is the Commonwealth&hyphen;state&hyphen;territory health ministers have asked the Australia&hyphen;New Zealand Food Authority to develop national <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> uniform food hygiene regulations. We have a mishmash of regulations around Australia. They take a very proscriptive approach. International evidence has shown this is not the most effective. The most effective is a risk based approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australia&hyphen;New Zealand Food Authority currently has new proposals out for consultation. The first round of consultations finishes on 13 December. They will then be refined, they will go out for consultation again and we hope the final round of consultations will finish very early in 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third thing that is happening is we are looking at reforming food hygiene regulations in two areas. The first is a new food hygiene standard. What we are trying to do with the food hygiene standard is to integrate what the Commonwealth does with initiatives at a state and territory level. That gives us some prospect of having a paddock to plate approach. The meat industry has already agreed to do this and we will start it from January 1997. Secondly, we are looking at changes to state and territory legislation to provide some cohesive legal framework to back that up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The food industry is one of Australia's largest manufacturing sectors. There is a great deal of excitement about its potential for export, particularly in Asia. The main emphasis of this push has been a clean and green approach. It is important that we have our own act together as far as food standards go. I can assure the honourable member that state, territory and Commonwealth health ministers take this very seriously.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

Why did the government not tell all firms that the selection criteria had been changed before they made their final pitch to the ministerial committee?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot answer all questions that relate to what other people have done but let me make one thing clear. Those two contracts, the advertising contract and the public relations contract, were meant to be complementary. The two agencies are meant to design and implement one campaign. When the short list was worked out and the presentations were organised they presented before the ministerial committee on the same night. I was not actually there.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The visit by six Australian ministers to Jakarta last week to participate in the biannual Australia Indonesia Ministerial Forum was a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> substantial success. It was a substantial success because at that meeting the Australian and Indonesian governments reached an historic agreement: the establishment of the Australia Indonesia Development Area, an initiative which I jointly announced on 25 October with  Minister Hartarto, the Indonesian coordinating minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">AIDA, as it is called, the Australia Indonesia Development Area, offers the prospect of a distinctive Australian role in the development of eastern Indonesia, development which will offer long&hyphen;term economic and broader benefits to both countries. Eastern Indonesia has lagged behind Indonesia's general rate of economic growth, but we have a direct interest in ensuring there is a high rate of growth in eastern Indonesia and we are therefore now more easily going to be able to participate in the development of that part of Indonesia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also add that this agreement between Australia and Indonesia is an historic breakthrough in Australia's engagement with Asia because this is the first time an Australian government has ever entered into a subregional agreement with an ASEAN country. In other words, this is an utterly practical way in which the government is engaging with Asia. There are several subregional growth areas within ASEAN: there is BIMP&hyphen;EAGA, as it is known, the Brunei Indonesia Malaysia and Philippines Growth Area; there is SIJORI, the Singapore Malaysia Indonesia Growth Triangle, and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This time the Australian government has itself been able to ensure that Australia participates in one of these growth areas. That I regard as a very substantial achievement and an historic breakthrough in Australia's engagement with Asia. We were delighted with the outcome of the meeting but, in addition to those results, the individual ministers had most successful bilateral meetings which also advanced very substantially Australian interests within their own specific portfolio areas. The meeting was worth while, it achieved a great deal and there is now an excellent atmosphere in Australia's relationship with Indonesia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was speaking earlier about the value of a public inquiry into the issue of concentration of ownership and other media policy issues, and was suggesting that questions such as what diversity in our media should mean in practice and how it can be distinguished from multiplicity, which is often mistakenly thought to be the same thing, would have been key points of examination in a public inquiry. In the current debate about freedom of speech it would have done much to broaden and deepen that discourse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Equally, the issue of foreign ownership and control, an issue about which a great many people in the community feel deeply concerned, could have been addressed. Foreign ownership and control of our media, even more than foreign ownership and control of other elements of the economy, is a matter that deserves greater attention than it has received in recent years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the area of cultural discussion and debate in Australia it is a particularly important and relevant question. A public inquiry would have advanced the issue of restraining foreign ownership. It would have been able to at least <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> start to consider in a public forum whether constricting foreign ownership and control was a sensible and important element in maintaining national sovereignty or whether it was simply not appropriate in an increasingly globalised marketplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From this question a third issue arises: whether or not restricting foreign ownership would only concentrate control in the hands of a limited number of wealthy and powerful Australian citizens. All these issues deserve a thorough examination, an examination which it appears will not now be as comprehensive as it could or should have been.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The possibility of a further concentration in the ownership of Australia's media should be resolutely opposed by this House. Of greatest concern is any move which would see either Kerry Packer or Rupert Murdoch acquire control of the Fairfax group should Conrad Black sell his 25 per cent controlling shareholding, a move which continues to be rumoured in the markets as a distinct possibility. His Fairfax group dominates classified advertising in Australia's two largest single markets, Sydney and Melbourne, and it is this domination which provides it with the income stream it needs to keep its cover price low and maintain market pre&hyphen;eminence. Should either Kerry Packer's PBL or Rupert Murdoch's News Ltd seek to gain control of Fairfax, the consequences for the diversity of ownership and opinion would be quite appalling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Control of this prestige organisation by either of these media players would also enhance their capability in the further development of online multimedia services into which both are expanding. Such moves would only further narrow the diversity of available information. Greater diversity and broadening of ownership should be achieved through media policy which encourages a greater number of Australian owners and operators and which promotes conditions which would foster such an environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Concentration of ownership and reduction of diversity are fundamental threats to the expression of ideas and freedom of speech in our democracy. If this House truly believes in the importance of this ideal then it should <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5895"> firmly oppose any further narrowing of our media ownership and urge a more constructive, open and public debate on issues of ownership and control.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say at the outset I have a great deal of empathy for the motion by the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore). I suspect his final words sum up very well the position which many in this place would take. We are very well aware the diversity needed in public debate in this country through the media is sadly lacking. I also know the honourable member has a track record in proposing just these particular measures within his own party forums&mdash;and each time has been rolled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Very simply, when we look back over recent history we can see it is the course of the previous government which, quite simply, created the quite horrendous positions we have now. Labor's legacy, which this government has inherited, has meant media ownership has become heavily concentrated. Diversity has all but disappeared; the prospects through pay television operations of additional players coming into the market are very limited. It is a great loss, not only to the Australian people but also to a viable media industry in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government's role in doling out political favours, in doling out political paybacks and the famous `get Packer' amendments which occurred prior to the last election in the dying days of the 37th parliament are all part and parcel of the case I would like to put before this House today. Even the Senate print media inquiry found the processes under the Foreign Investment Review Board were `secretive, superficial and open to political influence'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rupert Murdoch packed up, moved offshore and became an American citizen so he could satisfy their domestic rules as far as media ownership was concerned, but it did not stop him from maintaining a solid stake here in Australia. Hand in hand with Labor's legacy as far as these cosy deals are concerned is the reality there has been a great deal of lost jobs <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in the media industry over the years. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, I was one of those who had a career in the media for a number of years.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CK6">Mr HARDGRAVE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Fisher. I think I interviewed him once about 10 years ago in his earlier incarnation in this place. I must say it always pains me to believe both commercial and ABC media in this country have declined greatly over the course of the previous government. It is interesting to see average Australians turning off their commercial television and ABC television. Even radio is declining and newspaper sales are down. I think what we are seeing is people voting with their feet, saying they are hearing and seeing the same old rubbish day in day out and they are not all that interested.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another factor is media operators in this country are greatly disconnected with the community they should ideally be serving. I will deal primarily with the television industry through this particular speech. If you look back on the television act of 1953, inherent from those sorts of moves put forward by the Menzies government was the essential two&hyphen;station rule. Regardless of whether you owned stations in Tamworth and Taree, or Rockhampton and Mackay, or Sydney and Melbourne, two stations was all you could own. This meant a great diversity of ownership, and it was a very good thing. It also meant local boards. It meant local business people or local community people plugging in with media operators to ensure the local community was well served. A lot of it has disappeared now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is even worse, when you look at the so&hyphen;called independent ABC voice, it is now the independent ABC Sydney voice being seen and heard right throughout rural and regional Australia and interstate. The stupidity of `icing' the Queensland edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> as they did last year proves to me the ABC are just as out of touch.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a basic argument to put that media operations are different. Those on both sides of the chamber who practice the doctrine of market forces only dictating what should <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5896"> occur have to remember one thing: the media, by its very design, by the type of industry it is, has a built&hyphen;in market failure feature. It costs a great deal of money to enter the media and to maintain business in the media, so it naturally rules out free entry into the particular market. Therefore, it needs government intervention to prevent monopolies developing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous Labor government over the last 13 years forgot all about community interest, forgot all about providing average Australians with a diversity of view, forgot all about trying to prevent monopolies and happily went for the ride and drove the car on too many occasions as far as concentration of media ownership is concerned. There are so many examples.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to aggregation. I am sure, Mr Deputy Speaker, in your own electorate you would know how rural and regional Australia were promised great diversity of views. They were going to get two and three stations where there was once one. Coffs Harbour was well served for many years by the local station, and now there are a couple of other stations. What did people get? Not a diversity of views; they got Sydney and Melbourne plugged into them nightly. It is not what local people want.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we need to return to the core, decent elements of community service obligations, of being plugged into local communities to offer a range of views; views which were inherent 40 years ago in this country. This is not going to happen overnight because there is certainly a lot of money at stake, and a lot of very big businesses would probably reel in horror at any government which decided to make those changes. I suspect the motion of the honourable member for Fraser is all about saying, `Please, no more. We do not need it to go any further.' On such a basis, I think his motion has great validity and is very timely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note the difference between the previous government and this government. Quite openly, the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) said up&hyphen;front we want to make sure the national interest is put first. We cannot allow media ownership policy as a means of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> putting political allegiances and paybacks into the system ahead of looking after local, community and, through it, national interest. There are going to be absolute criteria to open up to public exposure any of the media ownership decisions which will take place before this current government. Relevant decision making processes will be conducted in the public arena. Reasons for decisions will be publicised as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think this is a tremendous commitment from this government. It is a coherent approach to media ownership and cross&hyphen;media regulation which will ensure plurality, diversity, competition, advances in technology, national and community broadcasting and local content as we try to evolve back to the basic decent tenets which we had in media policy prior to the advent of the Labor government of 1983-96.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite important to have these diverse views and to have competition back into the provision of public information. It always pained me when I was a journalist for commercial operators and even for the ABC to watch former colleagues in the press gallery in the Queensland parliament caucus as they attempted to work out who was going to put what particular slant on what particular story each night. Here we have for all intents and purposes competitors at the 6 o'clock news level who get together to decide what the particular angle to the story is going to be and which particular five&hyphen;second or 10&hyphen;second grab may occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) is quite correct: it probably happens here in the press gallery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It really is quite a shame and quite disgraceful and quite unethical this occurs. Let me tell members why it occurs. I have witnessed myself first&hyphen;hand where journalists would return to their newsroom and compile a story quite independently, based on the facts before them and the debate. They would present the story in a straightforward and direct way. Then their news producer would say to them, `Why didn't you have the particular angle the chap over on Channel 9 has?' So journalists found it difficult to explain why they did not have the same angle <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5897"> when they saw the story in a different way, which was their job and their professional right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now they caucus to ensure each other's hides are protected from each other's producers, to make sure everyone has the same line. I think that is very, very bad for Australia. I think it is very, very bad for the dissemination of information in the Australian community. I hope the members of the press gallery in this place and other places will repair their approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very important we do look closely at this motion before us today. It is quite timely we discuss the need to have public and open and accountable debate about cross-media and media ownership in this country. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) for raising this very important question. It is easy but regrettable to understand how it happened that Australia has the highest concentration of media ownership in any country of the Western world&mdash;even Ireland. Two major groupings dominate metropolitan daily newspapers and many provincial and suburban ones: News Corp, with 66.6 per cent of circulation, controlled by Rupert Murdoch, now a naturalised US citizen and resident, and John Fairfax Ltd, with 22 per cent, controlled by Canada's Conrad Black. Tony O'Reilly, an Irish&hyphen;American, owns a large share of suburban give&hyphen;away newspapers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same players, under different guises and different hats, also exercise a dominant share of some parts of the television empire. Since 1987, major proprietors have been forced to choose between newspaper or television ownership in specific metropolitan markets. In Paul Keating's telling phrase, proprietors could be `princes of the print' or `queens of the screen' but not both.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> With sharply increased program costs in the 1980s, the viability of some networks came under threat. Commercial television was no longer seen, as Roy Thomson once put it, as `a licence to print money'. With competition from the Sky television satellite services, another Rupert Murdoch possession, essen tially piped into hotels and clubs, pay television providing specialised services&mdash;mostly sport&mdash;and the prospect of picking up additional signals by satellite and subscribing to cable (optical fibre) services, the economic threat for the three existing commercial networks was acute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By 1994, new model television sets provided for up to 110 channels. The amount of worldwide quality programming was finite and would be diluted with an exponential increase in channels. This put most local production at hazard, with five networks in Sydney and Melbourne&mdash;commercial plus ABC plus SBS. With the potential for 30 channels, let alone 110, all of Australia's feature films since the 1930s could be absorbed in three days transmission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Foxtel, a partnership between News Corp&mdash;which owned Fox in the US&mdash;and Telstra announced in March 1995, had the potential for more than 200 channels on cable, some of them interactive. This made the challenge to local content even more pressing. Even interminable replays of sports events, panel games, low&hyphen;cost home improvement shows and crude assemblances such as the `World's Funniest Videos' would hardly suffice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue of protecting local content will become increasingly sensitive. In 1994, France fought GATT negotiators to make concessions to protect local film and television culture which could be swamped by Hollywood. Despite the significance of the information revolution and the information superhighway's potential as a transforming technology, governments generally have failed to sit down and assess the social, legal, political and economic implications to imagined policy responses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government, I regret to say, was no exception to that. Australia has been obtuse in that area, with an extraordinary degree of fragmentation of policy responsibility, compounded by a federal system where states can make laws about newspapers but the Commonwealth makes the laws for electronic media systems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In its report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia as an information society: grasping new paradigms</EMPHASIS>, the late lamented House of Representatives Standing <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5898"> Committee on Long Term Strategies complained that policy had generally evolved in an uncoordinated fashion, reacting to real or perceived crises. This has generally followed the adoption of a new technological or commercial form&mdash;for example, satellites, pay television, optical fibre and the privacy implications of data matching techniques.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other policy crises have risen unexpectedly: for example, Rupert Murdoch becoming a US citizen, the collapse of John Fairfax Ltd and two television networks going into receivership. Electronic funds transfers globalised Australia's economy and made it harder to control foreign debt. Other information related issues have included intellectual property rights, industrial espionage&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I would like to recognise the genuine concern of the member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) on this matter of media ownership and congratulate him for raising the issue. It is somewhat late, however, given that the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) has released a review of the cross&hyphen;media rules and released an issues paper on 1 October 1996. But I recognise that the timing of this motion is not in the hands of the member for Fraser.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of issues that have created the current circumstances which I think the House generally recognises have led to a review of cross&hyphen;media ownership rules. The first one which we need to contend with is the fact that in 1996 we have a new economy. Australian companies generally are having trouble coming to grips with the fact that low inflation means that they will no longer be able to bury ever increasing profits in inflationary increases in the prices of their products. Therefore, they have gone through a period of productivity increases through downsizing and through investments in technology and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is coming to a crunch point where they can no longer downsize. They are realising that they cannot jack up their prices in order <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to meet the profitability expectations of their shareholders. Therefore, they are looking to merge or take over their competitors in the industry in order to improve the economies of scale and therefore deliver increased profits. These challenges are going to be faced by companies such as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper, PBL, the Seven Network, Fairfax, the Ten Network and a whole range of other Australian media companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second area of change is in the area of convergence. The first part of that is the convergence of technology. Once we get a new stream of technology on board, such as the provision of satellites and satellite TV, we get a more improved form of delivering the service coming along such as cable. I well remember walking around the streets of Harare in Zimbabwe a few years ago looking at the enormous satellite dishes in the back of some of the more affluent homes and thinking, `This is the technology of the future.' Yet today we have better access to the same diversity of information through other means and certainly smaller satellite dishes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second part of that change relates to services. For example, telephone lines now deliver faxes and video signals and so on. That is a way of penetrating the market through the same means of communication. That is creating problems for those communications carriers that have been providing services in a way that we are accustomed to: for example, AM radio suddenly changing to FM radio, and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third part of that change relates to the convergence of enterprises. During the 1980s we saw a period of great greed and also great change. The change was actually the catalyst for the greed in relation to communications where we saw, for example, News Ltd purchase the Fox television studios and the Seven Network, more recently, make a substantial investment in MGM studios.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third area of significant change is globalisation, where you see honoured companies such as Time Warner, News Ltd and Sony becoming global players as opposed to specific regional players. News Ltd, a company which many of us are obviously familiar with, is a very good example of that; it is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5899"> penetrating every part of every continent. Satellite communications in particular have opened that up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the government has taken the right approach. Our focus is on three main areas. The first one is plurality, which relates to the number and kind of media outlets an individual should be able to control. The second area of our focus is diversity, particularly the diversity of programming, and we need to look at the various points of view that are promoted. The third area of our focus is competition. With the advent of the ACCC, competition has a new face to it in 1996 as opposed to previous years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Around the world media ownership rules are changing. In the United States last year, the US Congress passed legislation substantially modifying cross&hyphen;media ownership laws and the UK parliament is looking at a way of delivering cross&hyphen;media ownership. So the change is happening. It is a case of how we should manage that change, particularly in the light of the advent of new technologies, such as the Internet.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> (Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That this House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> recognise that veterans with psychiatric disabilities have problems in accessing public transport;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> vary the medical criteria that are set out in section 104 of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 regarding the recreational transport allowance to include a category that would extend the allowance to veterans with psychiatric disabilities; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> develop specifically identified other categories where service related disability inhibits travel on public transport that will allow a lower rate to veterans.</PARA>
<PARA>The reason for this motion is that I have been approached by a number of Vietnam veterans who have been having difficulties travelling on public transport. Some of them still have a great fear of crowds, or they cannot cope <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with strangers or loud noises. Some of them also have violent bouts of head pain, necessitating them to stop travelling or to return home very quickly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Tasmania, we have very limited public transport anyway, and I am finding that a lot of these veterans with this sort of disability are staying within the confines of their homes without venturing out. Of course, being restricted to their homes leads to all sorts of other disorders and severely limits the quality of life that these people can have. They do not have the freedom that a lot of people have, especially in pursuing recreational or other activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the life of the last government a review was undertaken into the psychiatric services of New South Wales. The review team was told of many instances in which veterans' conditions deteriorated due to delays in having their psychiatric condition accepted as a war related disability. Recommendation 11 stemming from that report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That psychiatric problems be given similar recognition to those malignancy and treatment approval (i.e. treatment card) be issued without involvement in the adversarial process.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>Those veterans with post traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, have very varied needs, and so do their families. PTSD sufferers need advice, assistance and access to counselling and therapy. But in the country, as you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, services of this nature are often non&hyphen;existent. How do these people manage to get into town or to access those sorts of facilities? If they cannot use public transport, then they cannot go. Originally, the recreation transport allowance was introduced in 1927 to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . arrange for suitable transport . . . for recreation under Departmental medical advice for those soldiers totally and permanently incapacitated as the result of spinal, head, pelvic or hip injury, organic cerebral or spinal disease, and to double amputation cases above or at the knee whose means of locomotion, because of war disablement, is permanently restricted to wheeled chairs or cots.</PARA>
<PARA>The introduction of this benefit would make it possible for an eligible member, whether he was resident in a metropolitan or country district or at a home or institution, to lead a brighter life and to be closer to the normal <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5900"> activities of life than would otherwise be possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was expanded again in 1930, in 1944 and in 1950, but it has not been changed much since then and there have been many quite different war situations with quite different traumas to contend with. It has been recognised that those in the Vietnam War, for instance, faced abnormal difficulties on their return from that war.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, these difficulties were not recognised in the old legislation, which I believe needs amending to recognise the problems which veterans have in accessing transport. In the Independent Inquiry into the Repatriation System, the report of which came out in June 1975, it was suggested that wider eligibility should be allowed for members who, while suffering little or no restrictions on their powers of locomotion, have limited mobility for other service related reasons. The sorts of things mentioned were allergic respiratory conditions that were made worse by conditions encountered on public transport, certain mental conditions such as intermittent amnesia, and severe physical disfigurement or abnormality where an unsatisfactory psychological adjustment exists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was considered under this review in 1975, the recommendation being that the recreation transport allowance at the lower level should be made available to such additional categories as can be specifically identified who, while suffering little or no restriction to the powers of locomotion, are nonetheless inhibited by their service&hyphen;related disabilities from travelling on public transport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> A further report was done in May 1994 on improving psychiatric care for veterans. The then Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Con Sciacca, accepted these recommendations. He looked at means by which he could address serious problems such as PTSD and developed a package for Vietnam veterans. He did put in place a number of things, but what he missed was the ability of some veterans to access some of the programs which were put in place. So, although recommended, it appears that legislation has not been changed and the department's interpretation still precludes veterans with the disabilities de scribed from accessing some means of private transport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My motion is merely to help some of our struggling Vietnam veterans to access programs which they cannot currently access because of their mobility problems. I do not believe it would be costly. In fact, it would apply to very few. But the improvement in the quality of life for those few would be worth an awful lot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am disappointed that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Mr Bruce Scott, is not in the chamber at the moment to take on board what I am saying about this very important issue. I hope he will give consideration to what I am saying and to this motion. The motion could apply to any service personnel, whether they served in the Vietnam War, the Second World War, the Korean War or any of the other conflicts in which our service personnel have been involved in recent times. I hope the minister will accept what I am saying. I am sure that the research is available in his department. It is only a matter of getting it out and looking it up. If he needs to be furnished with any further details, I can certainly find those for him. I commend the motion to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, as I rise to speak to the motion moved by the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Adams), allow me to take a moment, as I commence my response, to recognise the veterans of Australia, with particular reference to those in the veteran community in the Petrie electorate. In many ways it is quite timely to speak on issues concerning veterans, their needs and this government's commitment to this community group, with Remembrance Day only a few short weeks away.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Remembrance Day, like Anzac Day, is a time to think about sacrifices, a day to commemorate friendships and, most importantly, a day to remember. At any time when we speak about our veteran community we speak <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5901"> about them with great pride. The Petrie electorate has a strong and recognisable veteran community. It focuses on ideals and binds together to provide friendship and support. With this in mind, I wish to take this opportunity to recognise in the House the fine work and the efforts of the veteran community and Returned and Services League sub&hyphen;branches in the Petrie electorate. The changing needs of veterans is something that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott), I know, is fully aware of and takes a particular interest in. It is also of great concern to this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition came to government with a policy of support and commemoration for our veteran community and will continue to work closely with them and the associated representative bodies and associations now and well into the future. Demographics show that by the turn of the century some 60 per cent of the Australian veteran community will be over the age of 75 years. This strongly indicates that the pressure on social, emotional and support services will also increase. The government has made a very positive step for the veteran community, particularly in the areas of assistance, restructuring and simplifying areas which in the past have had logistical problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the recent federal budget a number of key initiatives were directed specifically at veterans. These included: the streamlining of aged pension payments to veterans receiving disability pensions, improved entitlements to veterans for footwear and spectacles, innovative training programs and improvements to the health services of veterans through more efficient and effective use of medication.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an unfortunate but recognisable fact that many veterans suffer from a type of disability, whether it be a physical disability, intellectual or psychological. Our community has come a long way in accepting and including those with disabilities in a range of recreational and social activities. Veterans who suffer from psychiatric illnesses, in particular, have their own special needs which have to be addressed. This is an important point to make&mdash;that those with psychiatric <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> disabilities do have differing needs to those who suffer intellectual or physical disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In many cases those who have psychiatric illnesses can be extremely intelligent but, however, can suffer major mood swings and panic attacks which could be triggered by a whole range of everyday social interactions. I am of the understanding that people who suffer from this illness can be prone to a whole range of phobias. Whether it be crowds or confined spaces or loud noises, the resulting impact can bring terrible anxiety. This is a serious illness, where withdrawing from society can lead to post traumatic stress disorder or clinical depression. For example, the depression which some Vietnam veterans have suffered can result in chilling detachment from modern day life. I acknowledge the mention that the member for Lyons has made in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is concerned with the needs of all disabled veterans, particularly in relation to ensuring that they lead healthy and very fulfilling lives. Socialising and being part of the community are important factors and the government is striving to provide support for veterans through a number of programs. The Department of Veterans' Affairs plays an important role in the managing of services and support for veterans and their families. The department works closely with disabled veterans providing opportunities for social and cultural interactions. Often the assistance the Department of Veterans' Affairs provides includes organising or hiring transport, whether it be buses or taxis, so that disabled veterans can attend social functions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the community gets older it is acknowledged that their needs will change, and this is true for veterans who suffer from psychiatric disability. It places a great deal of added pressure on the support and care structures which already are in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to acknowledge the success of the Veterans' Health Week which was held recently. This week provided an opportunity to highlight the needs and issues surrounding the health of veterans. The week also provided a tremendous opportunity to give veterans with disabilities a chance to participate in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5902"> activities which they may not have been able to do previously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the honourable member's motion he has raised the issue of widening the eligibility criteria for veterans with psychiatric disabilities in relation to the recreation transport allowance. He quoted a number of reports, including the 1974 and 1994 reviews. The recreation transport allowance is a benefit paid by the department to assist certain disabled veterans with the cost of transport for the purposes of recreation. The allowance was introduced in 1927. Its intention was for the allowance to benefit those veterans with physical disabilities and to enable them to participate in the normal activities of life that would otherwise be impossible for them to enjoy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the years the eligibility criteria were widened to include veterans with physical disabilities, including war caused amputations and blindness. The criteria, though, were already restricted to physical incapacity which hindered a veteran's movement. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has indicated to me that he is most happy to re-examine any benefit provided to veterans. This government has given a commitment that veterans are provided with benefits and services which best meet their needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member also moved that the House develops specifically identified other categories where service related disability inhibits travel on public transport that allows a lower rate to veterans. With this in mind, it is worth making the point and drawing to the attention of the House that section 104(1) of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 contains a table which indicates a description of incapacity in respect of which recreation transport allowance will be paid and per fortnight payments in respect of each of these. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the current legislation the lower rate of recreation transport allowance, which is currently $26.40 per fortnight, is paid to veterans who have both arms amputated at or above the wrist; have both legs amputated below the knees; have one leg amputated above the knee and the other below the knee; have one leg amputated above or below the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> knee and one arm amputated below the elbow; are blind in both eyes; are incapacitated to an extent that, in the opinion of the Repatriation Commission, is similar or severe to the extent of incapacity associated with the amputations which I have described or are handicapped in relation to locomotion to a degree that, in the opinion of the Repatriation Commission, is similar in degree to the handicap in relation to locomotion associated with the amputations which I have described or blindness. I should also mention that the act specifies that the loss of function suffered by the veteran must be permanent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me finish by saying that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs is well aware of the issues which have been raised by the honourable member for Lyons in terms of those who suffer from psychiatric disabilities. I am sure that the minister will review the situation. I have indicated to the House today that those who suffer from psychiatric illness do have special needs which have to be met. The government has already shown in many cases that it is open to consultation and will review with an aim to providing the support which is necessary to ensure the quality of life for our veterans community.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support this motion. I do so on the basis that there are many veterans across my electorate of Isaacs&mdash;indeed, throughout Australia&mdash;who suffer from what can only be described as debilitating psychiatric illnesses and who are, as the member for Lyons (Mr Adams) has so succinctly and lucidly indicated before the House today, prisoners of these war&hyphen;induced psychiatric illnesses. They are not only a prisoner of the illness from the perspective of health but also a prisoner, in many cases, in their own homes&mdash;a symptom of these war related psychiatric disabilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> These veterans are too timid, too afraid, too sick to leave their own homes. As the member for Petrie (Ms Gambaro) has indicated, they suffer from phobias, mood swings depression and panic attacks which see them too afraid to venture too far beyond the confines of an environment that they know well. For the many veterans who have fought so bravely for our country in so many theatres <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5903"> of war around the world, this motion provides the opportunity to free themselves of the shackles of this condition by affording them the chance to get out and about, having benefited from the application of this particular recreational travelling allowance for those who suffer from psychiatric illness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> An expansion of the recreational transport allowance to veterans with such designated war&hyphen;induced psychiatric conditions would, as I say, facilitate greater mobility and access to the range of medical, counselling and other services which are available to eligible veterans. As the member for Lyons has alluded to, a former Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the Hon. Con Sciacca, commissioned a report on the provision of benefits to impaired veterans. The most recent of such reports was released in May 1994. This went to the question of improving care for psychiatrically impaired veterans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Subsequently, the minister placed before the House a package containing a number of measures to address post-traumatic stress disorders and other similar conditions. Notwithstanding the gains that were made in this area by the former minister, these problems prevail and remain a problem for veterans in Australia. To that end, there have been no recent legislative changes to expand the application of this allowance to other veterans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is compounded by the problem that the Department of Veterans' Affairs still precludes veterans with conditions related to post-traumatic stress disorder from accessing appropriate transport for recreational purposes, be it public transport, taxis or the like. The member for Petrie has also drawn our attention to fact that the current Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), is happy to canvass any issue which may result in a review of this iniquitous situation and, indeed, has stated that he is well aware of its existence. I implore the minister to act on behalf of affected veterans and to extend this allowance to those who are so psychiatrically impaired.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I conclude by saying that, from its inception, the intent of this allowance has been to assist veterans who have physical mobility <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> problems to obtain transport for recreational purposes. I think this should be extended to those who have designated psychiatric problems. As I said, there have been no recent demands to expand the eligibility criteria to these long-serving veterans. To that end, I implore the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the member for Maranoa, to act and rectify this iniquitous situation. Given that we are approaching Remembrance Day, I think that affords him a fine opportunity to remember the fine deeds and brave acts that have resulted in our country being free today. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House for the opportunity to speak on this subject as it is one which affects some people in my electorate of Bowman. I have listened to the needs of certain individuals who have brought their concerns to me in my electorate office. Most Australians take public transport for granted. It may be inconvenient and crowded but it is always there when the need arises. You may not feel comfortable with the person you are sitting next to, but you know that this trip will soon be over and you will be able to get on with your day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just for a moment imagine, if you can, that you suffer from a psychiatric disability&mdash;one which leads to panic attacks whenever you are in a crowded place&mdash;then imagine yourself on a crowded bus or train. Unfortunately, for many people in our society this situation is a daily occurrence. For these people, having to travel on public transport is one of the hardest things in the world to do. This leads to social isolation, which in turn can have a detrimental effect on the future wellbeing of the sufferer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also unfortunate that a large number of our returned service men and women suffer from some form of psychiatric illness. Veterans can also demonstrate extreme social withdrawal as part of conditions such as post&hyphen;traumatic stress disorder or clinical depression, as has been previously mentioned. A large number of our veterans have simply withdrawn from society rather than confront the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government recognises the need to ensure these veterans lead a healthy and fulfilling life, which includes getting out into <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5904"> the community and socialising. As previously mentioned by the member for Petrie (Ms Gambaro), the government already has in place a number of programs to help veterans. There is a joint ventures program run by the Department of Veterans' Affairs which helps other organisations run social functions for disabled veterans. Through this program, funding has been provided to purchase vehicles to transport veterans to these functions. It is encouraging to note that a substantial amount of this funding has gone to functions organised by veterans who are long-term sufferers from psychiatric illnesses and who fully understand the problems of social isolation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is the highly successful Veterans' Health Week, which encourages veterans and their families to get involved in a variety of activities. Many of the activities offered during the week would usually never be accessible to people with psychiatric disabilities. Not only does this program give veterans the chance to socialise, but it also gives them a sense of achievement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The community care seeding grants program, through which the department provides funds to assist veterans and war widows live independently in the community, has also proven successful and is contributing to the quality of life of a great number of people. So you can see that the government does consider social isolation as a serious problem and is taking steps to ensure the impact is lessened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, while the government is already actively involved in a number of programs which give assistance, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) has indicated he is always willing to consider improvements to those programs which will further enhance the quality of life for veterans. The minister has given an assurance that he will have his department review the recreational transport allowance, taking into account the suggestions made by the member for Lyons (Mr Adams) in his motion moved in this House. I conclude on that note: that the minister will take up any suggestions and look at them for approval.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>I recall the painful years during my adolescence when my father was bedridden, slowly dying of the illnesses that sapped him of life. The shadow of death hovered over my studies as I lived with the knowledge that the next phone call could be to tell me of his death. Later, I experienced the losses that many of us have felt&mdash;family members to cancer, the tragedy of a young cousin disconnected from a respirator after a car accident. Like all of us, I have seen people die: some quickly, some slowly, some peacefully, and some in circumstances we wish were different.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We cannot ignore our emotional experiences, any more than we should ignore the consequences of our decisions for all Australians. This debate is about passing a bill that protects the vulnerable&mdash;or about leaving them exposed to pressure, abuse and a loss of autonomy.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this case with this bill, the parliament has express constitutional power. Yet we hear urgings that we should ignore our responsibilities on the spurious grounds that one small <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5905"> territory, with the population of a suburban municipality in Melbourne or Sydney, by one vote, without any house of review, without attempting to state why a law rejected by every major inquiry in the world was proper, and in the face of universal opposition from its Aboriginal population&mdash;whose remonstrance in the form of this letter stick I bring before this parliament and the text of which I will seek to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>&mdash;can pass a law that affects many Australians and then claim, nay, demand, that we wash our hands of our responsibilities.</PARA>

<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Church and State</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, it would be strange if only those without religious belief could express an opinion on such a profound matter as this. The fact that no other parliament has been prepared to pass such a law is evidence of the breadth of the opposition&mdash;something which Hippocrates expressed thousands of years ago when he said: `I will neither give a deadly drug to anybody if asked for it, nor will I make a suggestion to this effect.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People like Colleen McCullough, with no religious beliefs, and Professor Malcolm Fisher, who describes himself as a `born again heathen', strenuously oppose lethal injections. There are religious and non&hyphen;religious people on both sides of this debate. Let us deal with the arguments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the arguments is that it is happening already, so we should regulate it. This is like saying that some people will obtain high powered automatic guns, so we should regulate, not ban them. If a person is willing to disregard a law which says lethal injections are never allowed, why would they be constrained by a law which says lethal injections are sometimes allowed? If some doctors are prepared to take the law into their own hands and reject the clear requirements for knowledge and consent, why would they change their attitude, especially when dealing with an incompetent patient?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An independent South Australian study found that 49 per cent of doctors and nurses who said that they had assisted a person to die did so without the knowledge or the consent of the person concerned. As the Dutch Attorney&hyphen;General, Professor Remmelink, found: many cases of euthanasia are certified simply as death by natural causes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The law will have no impact at all on these circumstances. Indeed, the Northern Territory law is so poorly drafted that not only are the definitions of terminal illness and depression wide open, a coroner has no basis on which to investigate any death once a certificate is signed by the doctors involved in giving the lethal injection. Despite its procedures, the Northern Territory law has major flaws. If the safeguards are disregarded, the only witness is dead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just as the law against automatic weapons will not stop possession of all automatic weapons, laws against homicide will not stop a minority of doctors from practising euthanasia. But the law does send a message, and in the case of many people, it will protect them from abuse and save lives in circumstances where people have changed their minds. Euthanasia legislation sends a powerful message to the Australian community that the vulnerable are expendable and not valued. What we in this parliament legislate to allow, we approve and encourage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nor is this is a debate about personal autonomy. A lethal injection is not an autonomous action, even with the use of a machine. If only one person is involved, we are not talking about euthanasia. But can anyone recall the death of a family member or friend that affected no&hyphen;one else? As the House of Lords committee stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The issue of euthanasia is one in which the interest of the individual cannot be separated from the interest of society as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA>With euthanasia, the patient gives up all control to the doctor. John Stuart Mill insisted that no&hyphen;one could, in the name of freedom, sell oneself into `unfreedom'. This is why we maintain that people cannot freely sell themselves into slavery. This is why our laws <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5906"> reject consent to bodily harm as a defence in a court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Euthanasia involves quality of life judgments by the doctor about the patient. If a physically well person is suicidal, we provide them with counselling and care. Witness our response to the tragedy of youth suicide. But, under the euthanasia laws, if an ill person is suicidal, the doctor decides that care is no longer required. In the doctor's mind, death becomes an option.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not to mention the pressures, subtle and otherwise, on the elderly and infirm, many of whom already feel a great burden to others. This is why groups representing the disabled and the elderly generally have rejected pro&hyphen;euthanasia positions. But consider also the objectives of euthanasia proponents, such as Peter Singer:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We should treat human beings in accordance with their ethically relevant characteristics . . . They include consciousness, the capacity for physical, social and mental interaction with other beings, having conscious preferences for continued life, and having enjoyable experiences. Other relevant aspects depend on the relationship of the being to others, having relatives for example who will grieve over your death, or being so situated in a group that if you are killed, others will fear for their lives.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the unconscious, the incompetent and the incapable have lost some or all of the characteristics which demand the protection of the law. Even being alone, having no&hyphen;one, in Professor Singer's words, to `grieve over your death' may be sufficient to justify and to allow intentional killing. As the authors of the Netherlands Remmelink report state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But is it not true that once one accepts [voluntary] euthanasia and assisted suicide the principle of universality forces one to accept the termination of life without explicit request, at least in some circumstances, as well? In our view, the answer to this question must be affirmative.</PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, Professor Singer has extended his principle to the conscious but handicapped infant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Coalition of Organisations for Voluntary Euthanasia has, as one of its commitments, that legalised euthanasia should apply to people with disabilities even if they do not <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have a terminal illness&mdash;something which one of its sponsors, Professor Baume, confirmed again just yesterday. A logical consequence of this policy is the finding of the Dutch Supreme Court that a doctor could give a lethal injection to a 50&hyphen;year&hyphen;old woman whose husband had left her and whose two sons had died, but who was without any physical illness and who refused bereavement counselling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Proponents of euthanasia already argue that a lethal injection can be given to a person incapable of consenting. The events of the past century reveal that once voluntary euthanasia is accepted, the language of rights will be employed to argue that those who are incapable of giving consent also have a `right', as determined by another person, to a lethal injection. Far from enhancing autonomy, euthanasia will lead to more control over the lives of many people. This is revealed in the Dutch finding that 27 per cent of people given a lethal injection had neither expressed consent nor had knowledge of their impending death by that injection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the consequences of a choice in favour of euthanasia. The discouragement of suicide is removed for certain categories of people on the judgement of others that their lives are unworthy of living because of sickness or disability. How can we establish categories of people who, if they are suicidal, are to be given a lethal injection, without devaluing all the people in these categories? What is so compassionate about telling people who feel worthless that they are better off dead? The steps in the Northern Territory act do not address these issues. Euthanasia makes a mockery of autonomy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5907"> Three&hyphen;quarters of the population believe euthanasia is about turning off machines. This bill does not prevent either the discontinuation of treatment or the provision to patients of the most effective forms of pain relief, even if that treatment coincidentally hastens death. The purpose of this bill is to restate the clear principle that the legislative assemblies have no power to make laws which permit or have the effect of permitting the form of intentional killing of another, whether conscious or unconscious, called euthanasia&mdash;which in cludes mercy killing&mdash;or the assisting of a person to terminate his or her life. It restates the existing law in the states and territories of Australia, with the notable exception of the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some say that there is no difference between turning off a machine or refusing treatment and a lethal injection. Many of us know of someone who has decided against another course of chemotherapy. We do not say that is the same as a lethal injection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If a person is given a lethal injection, it is the injection that kills them. Presumably, another injection would be given if the first did not work. If we turn off a machine, it is the illness which leads to death. If, as has occurred in many cases, the person continues to live, we care for them. We have no intention to bring about their death.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a simple test for euthanasia&mdash;that is to ask: what would you do if the person lived? If you discontinue treatment and the person lives, you continue to care for them. If you provide pain relief which risks hastening death, you only provide more doses when required to relieve pain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Intention is the cornerstone of our ethical and legal systems. A person may shoot another, but not be guilty of homicide, if the shooting was in self&hyphen;defence, was provoked, or was an unforeseen accident. It is the intention to kill that makes the action an offence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At a time when health costs are escalating, the population is ageing, there is a contraction of hospital beds and people are lying on trolleys in hospital corridors in just about every state and territory of this nation, the community is reluctant to raise taxes, and the Economic Planning Advisory Council and others such as the former Governor&hyphen;General Bill Hayden have discussed euthanasia in the context of the cost and economics of health care, it is naive to think that economic judgments are not being made and that pressures will not intensify on the elderly. Consider also the costs of palliative care&mdash;some $5,000 to $6,000 on average for a person in the terminal stages of their life in a palliative care hospice compared to just $25 for a lethal injection.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a conscience vote about how we respond to a person who says, `I want you to end my life.' A wise and prudent judgment must take account of human nature as it is. To believe that with the stroke of the Administrator's pen all people will act altruistically is to condemn people to unconsented deaths. In the analogous situation of capital punishment, we maintain that if one innocent person is going to be killed, even after the very public and due process of the law with all its reviews and appeals, then that is too high a price.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we should do is to provide high quality palliative care and enact modern refusal of treatment legislation, neither of which has been done in the Northern Territory. And we should take note that every major committee of inquiry in the world, every parliament bar one, the Aboriginal people, the various religious groups, the world medical profession and those representing people with disabilities have all rejected euthanasia. They have rejected it on one unifying principle: the people who are most at risk are the most vulnerable, and a law which fails to protect vulnerable people will always be a bad law.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in opposition to the private member's bill currently before this parliament. My opposition to the bill is on philosophical, practical and technical grounds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is philosophically wrong in that it overturns the legitimately enacted law of another democratically elected parliament. It is philosophically wrong because it imposes a set of beliefs on people who do not share those beliefs. It is philosophically wrong because it denies choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is dangerous in that it gives the parliamentarians in this place a position of moral superiority we do not and should not have. It is legally wrong in that it perpetuates the system whereby doctors kill their patients outside the law and without supervision or regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is morally wrong in that it prevents doctors from legally responding to a dying patient's plea to end their suffering. It is technically wrong in that it does not define its terms and is likely to have consequences in the Northern Territory and the ACT that were not intended.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What right have we as a democratically elected parliament to overturn the properly enacted legislation of another legitimate and democratically elected parliament? This is not simply a matter of states rights. The overturning of the Northern Territory legislation is more fundamental.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we pass this bill, this parliament is saying to the parliamentarians of the Northern Territory, `Our decision making capabilities are better than yours. We know better than you do.' I cannot believe that our arrogance would be so great that we could be seduced into such a dictatorial point of view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How dare we, as parliamentarians in a democracy, presume to treat the Northern Territory parliament with such disdain. We may currently have a constitutional right, but we do not have a moral or a democratic right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My second objection to this bill is that it imposes the belief system of one group of people onto another. In our society, many people believe extremely strongly that, if they are dying, it is their right to choose to end their suffering when it becomes unbearable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another group who hold an equally strong belief that there is something inherently wrong in a person choosing to shorten their life by a week, a day or even an hour. Each group starts from a fundamentally different premise. Because these are value judgments no&hyphen;one can say that one group is right and the other wrong. Both groups have an equally valid right to voice their own point of view, yet those promoting this bill intend to impose their particular beliefs on everyone else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am a Liberal, and as a Liberal I support choice. I do not believe that any one section of the community or any group of parliamentarians has the right to enforce their view on the people on such a very personal subject as this. The Northern Territory act is about allowing that choice. It provides those who cannot bear to suffer any longer with the option of choosing to end that suffering. It does not deny the legitimacy of another belief system and it does not impose one particular point of view on the entire population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Surveys have shown that the majority of people in Australia support the right of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5909"> dying to choose whether or not to end unbearable suffering by hastening their death. Australians are asking to be given a choice. If the parliament passes this bill, it denies them their fundamental democratic right to that choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This leads me to the third and fourth objections, which are the practical consequences of this bill. This bill perpetuates a law which prevents doctors from legally helping someone to end their life. This bill imposes on doctors a legal obligation to watch someone die, to see their agony, to listen to their pleas for a quick end and to do nothing. Under the law the only compassionate act the doctor will be able to perform is to alleviate some of the physical pain by administering increasingly large doses of morphine, the effect of which is to remove dignity, self&hyphen;control and the ability to think and to communicate. Let us be very clear: this bill is not about prolonging life but about prolonging suffering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further consequence of this bill is that it asks parliamentarians in this place and all Australians to turn a blind eye to the deliberate hastening of death that we know goes on without supervision and outside the law. An opponent of this bill, a member of this House, has said that he has been involved in euthanasia as a doctor on two occasions. Seven doctors in Victoria have named themselves publicly as regularly taking part in euthanasia. Fourteen per cent of doctors in New South Wales have responded to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Medical Journal</EMPHASIS> declaring that they have assisted their patients in euthanasia. Eighty&hyphen;one per cent of these said they had done it on more than one occasion. Doctors are killing their patients today. They are doing it without supervision, without regulation, and they are doing it outside the law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Northern Territory says to doctors, `You do not have the right to end the life of a patient simply because you believe it is the right thing to do.' It gives a strict set of guidelines that must be adhered to before euthanasia can be carried out. The prime requirement is that patients must ask. In the present situation, we do not know how many doctors are acting because it is the patient's will and how many because they assume it is the patient's will. But we do know, because <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> they have told us, that doctors are killing their patients and this is done without supervision, without regulation and without due process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the Northern Territory act one medical opinion is not enough. As well as the request of the dying patient, the act requires the endorsement of a specialist in the condition the patient is dying from, of a psychiatrist and of a palliative care expert. The situation in the states, the ACT and the Northern Territory, if this bill is passed, is that doctors are making the decision to terminate life but without the safeguards inherent in the Northern Territory act. Passing this bill means that decisions will continue to be made by doctors without consultation, decisions will continue to be made by doctors in secret and decisions to terminate life will be made without knowing what the patient wants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a key problem. Under the present system in Australia outside the Northern Territory, doctors are too scared to discuss this issue with their patients and so they make end of life decisions without consulting them. The Northern Territory act has brought this covert process into the open. It empowers the patient, disempowers those doctors who believe that theirs is the only opinion that matters and empowers those doctors who wish to act within the law and according to the wishes of their patients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An argument for the bill is that it is supported by the Australian Medical Association. Not all doctors groups agree with the AMA, and I have faxes from doctors groups such as the Private Doctors Association saying that they support the Northern Territory act. The support from the AMA for the Andrews anti&hyphen;euthanasia bill is one of the most disturbing aspects of this debate, as much of that support appears to come from doctors who are prepared to assist dying patients to die but do not want the regulation of the law. Their answer is that the system works okay now. The system does not work okay now. Doctors are not God and cannot be allowed to act as if they were. If doctors are assisting death, which by their own admission they are, then this must be placed under the law. Any country which respects law cannot allow killing to go on unsupervised on the basis of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5910"> the argument that the system works well as it is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another argument frequently put forward for the bill is that people ask for euthanasia only when palliative care is poor. This is nonsense, as palliative care doctors have testified. Daw Park Hospice provides the best palliative care available anywhere, yet the director of the unit is a strong supporter of euthanasia. He says that palliative care does not always work; there are times when palliative care cannot take away suffering, times when the patient begs for a quicker death, and for those times he needs the legal option of assisting those patients to have their wish and put an end to their suffering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have other technical objections to the bill. Euthanasia is not defined in the bill so we cannot know with any certainty the implications of the bill. Further, the bill outlaws intentional killing. The member for Menzies says that his bill will not outlaw the turning off of life support machines. When you turn off a machine, when it is that machine which is keeping a person alive, that is intentional killing. Therefore, it would appear that there is a good reason to believe that if this bill is passed it will outlaw the turning off of life support machines in the Northern Territory and the ACT, despite assurances from the member for Menzies that this is not his intention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have mentioned before that I would like to see this bill discharged from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> for a number of reasons. I have canvassed members on both sides of the House to see what support there is for a discharge motion. At this stage, there is very large support for that. There are also a large number of members who have not made up their minds and are uncertain, at this stage, whether or not they want to see the bill discharged. I will therefore not be moving such a motion at this time but will consider it at a later time when and if those people make up their minds. At this stage, there is enormous support for this House to not discuss this bill and that support is growing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, in my six years as a member of the Australian parliament, this piece of legislation is the most disturbing that has come before <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> me. Its assumptions are frightening, as are its consequences. I urge all members to vote against it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to second the motion that the Euthanasia Laws Bill be read a second time because I do not believe that one person should deliberately take the life of another or assist in the death of another. I am vehemently opposed to all forms of state sanctioned killing, be they the death penalty, euthanasia or even so&hyphen;called `just' wars. This bill has raised much public interest and discussion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the outset, I would like to thank the many Australians who wrote to me outlining their views for and against euthanasia. Many of these letters contain very personal accounts of people's experiences with severe illness, death and dying. Many were from organisations with a long history of dealing with complex moral and medical issues. I have read and considered the views put in each of those letters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the course of this debate, members with professional backgrounds will undoubtedly outline, better than I could hope to, all the legal and medical reasons for and against euthanasia. Members will give positive examples of the use of euthanasia and others will outline cases where euthanasia was at first requested but where later those patients were grateful that the option was not available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My contribution to this debate will be from the perspective of an ordinary Australian. I come from a working&hyphen;class family and my life experience has been of working people whose hopes and aspirations are to earn a living, buy a house, bring up a family and put something away for retirement&mdash;in other words, to live a full and happy life in the community and to die after at least, nowadays, four score years and 10.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what is it that changes the part of the dream about dying peacefully into an issue which is taking the attention of this parliament today? I believe it is fear&mdash;fear that death will come painfully; a pain which cannot be ameliorated; a disease that will take away a person's dignity and humanity.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5911">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Euthanasia&mdash;that is, the taking of specific actions aimed at ending life&mdash;sometimes sounds like the perfect remedy for those fears. What could be better? Should you be struck down with a painful terminal illness, you could ask your doctor to assist you in hastening your death. Unfortunately, things are never as easy as they seem at first. A number of issues become apparent when contemplating euthanasia as an issue for a nation as apart from an issue for the individual.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Suffering involves not just physical suffering but mental suffering. There is clear evidence that patients requesting euthanasia are frequently clinically depressed. A study reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">American Journal of Psychiatry</EMPHASIS> found that the desire for death in terminally ill patients is closely associated with clinical depression and can decrease over time. The treatment of the depression greatly reduces the incidence of patients seeking euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to ask ourselves under what circumstances euthanasia would be allowed. Terminal illness comes in many guises and suffering in many forms. How imminent would death have to be? How painful would the pain have to be? What about diseases such as motor neurone disease or Alzheimer's&mdash;not painful in the usual sense, but surely capable of inflicting enormous mental suffering? Even at the beginning of this discussion we start by putting limits on when euthanasia might be allowed and to whom it might be available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen wide&hyphen;ranging inquiries into the likely consequences of legalising euthanasia. These include a 1994 report of a House of Lords select committee, the New York State Task Force on Life and the Law in 1994 and a report by the Canadian Senate. Each of these reports has recommended against legalising euthanasia on the grounds that it would not be possible to make the law safe because it would not be possible to protect others from the risk of abuse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> For the vast majority of people there is no question but that this would have to be a purely voluntary scheme if it came into effect. No&hyphen;one could be forced, coerced, cajoled or persuaded into having their life ended prema turely. But where does coercion and persuasion end and what some would call commonsense begin? I believe that, should euthanasia become an accepted practice in this country, older Australians might be placed under unnecessary pressure by the belief that they should use euthanasia rather than become a burden on their children. The right to die, once accepted, too easily becomes a duty to die.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's law and ethos rests on the belief that life is precious. On this premise we have built up a society that aims to ensure that every member of our community is able to live out their lives in dignity, with a roof over their heads, food in their mouths, education and health care&mdash;the list goes on. Respect for the elderly led to the introduction of the Commonwealth old age pension scheme in 1909. More recently, the Commonwealth has provided funding for nursing homes, hospices and hostels to ensure assistance is available for older Australians no longer able to care for themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our society has been constant in its message that all its people are important, no matter their age or medical condition. Euthanasia will send a message that there are now some we may not protect, some we will assist to die&mdash;not just allow nature to take its course but actively assist them to die. What does this do to the frail aged, the terminally ill or the handicapped in this country? While any legislation may specifically refer to voluntary euthanasia, knowing that there is a quick and painless alternative to what may be a long and difficult path to death&mdash;and if that is a legal alternative&mdash;must put pressure on the sufferer to relieve their burden and, more importantly I think to the sufferer, the burden on their carers. The 1994 report of the House of Lords select committee noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are also concerned that vulnerable people&mdash;the elderly, lonely, sick or distressed&mdash;would feel pressure, whether real or imagined, to request early death. We believe that the message which society sends to vulnerable and disadvantaged people should not, however obliquely, encourage them to seek death, but should assure them of our care and support in life.</PARA>
<PARA>Anyone who has nursed a very sick or elderly relative knows that the stresses and strains <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5912"> both parties are placed under are enormous. The drain on time, emotions and even finances is tremendous. Sometimes people feel trapped in situations they do not want to be in, trapped by either family ties or circumstances. They often do not know of any assistance which might be available or alternative care programs. Many would lack the financial wherewithal to engage additional assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is difficult to understand how these complex emotional situations often affect the parties involved. It is also impossible to believe that both parties would not, at some time, contemplate the alternative presented by legalised euthanasia. An editorial in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Asiaweek</EMPHASIS> put it in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consider also who might take the most advantage of state&hyphen;assisted suicide. Probably the poor, the minorities and the disenfranchised&mdash;those with the least control of their lives. They will find it easy to choose death, because life has held so little for them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What can be said of a community that neglects some of its members from the day they are born, and then, when they lose all hope, readily helps them to end it all?</PARA>
<PARA>The availability of euthanasia is also likely to downgrade research into new approaches to palliative care. As legislators we all know it is harder to argue for a greater allocation of funds for programs for which there are cheaper alternatives. This would surely be the case with euthanasia versus palliative care. Many people suffer unduly because of insufficient palliative care programs. This is especially true for Australians living away from major cities. Many people have no idea what palliative care is or how to obtain these services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Greater promotion of these programs, I believe, would greatly increase their accessibility and people would not feel the necessity of considering the alternative of euthanasia. It goes without saying that more money needs to be directed to palliative care programs to ensure that all Australians have access to high quality programs which aim to provide medical and social support for the terminally ill. It would be hypocritical to deny access to a painless death if you are, at the same time, denying people access to effective pain relief and care services. It is therefore distressing to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> realise that the government cut funding for palliative care by 10 per cent in the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having outlined some of the reasons I am opposed to euthanasia, I need to emphasise my support for current medical practices which allow sufficient latitude for doctors to ensure that their patients can die with dignity when all treatment options have been exhausted. I do not know of any person who would argue against the administration by a doctor of morphine for pain relief, even to the point where the doctor knows that the morphine may eventually hasten the death of the patient. This is not euthanasia as the primary use of the drug is pain relief.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also support the right of patients to refuse further medical treatment. I believe that every adult has the right to refuse treatment in general and life sustaining medical treatment in particular. Refusing active treatment to sustain life and taking steps to end life are entirely different issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In considering euthanasia laws we should also note the huge responsibility that we already place on medical practitioners. I would not wish to place the added burden of having to take the life of another person on anyone. I presume that although it would be open to doctors to take part in euthanasia there would certainly be cases&mdash;and I think this would apply particularly in rural Australia&mdash;where patients would have access to a very limited number of doctors. If you were the only doctor readily available to patients seeking euthanasia I think it would be very difficult to refuse. Were I looking for assistance with death I would want it to come from a trusted friend, not from a total stranger. How difficult would it be for my physician of 30 years to refuse me such a request when it was a legally available treatment option? These are impossible situations to place another human being in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some participants in this debate are going to argue that this is an issue of states rights. The cold, hard facts are that the Northern Territory is not a state and, as such, is a subordinate legislature to this parliament. It is therefore beholden on this institution to make such laws as are necessary to protect all Australians. On an issue such as this I believe <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5913"> there should be a broad national consensus. When we have that legislature that represents the second smallest group of Australians passing a law that can have an effect on all Australians, there is not consensus. The ACT parliament sought consensus and, when it could not get it on its heroin trials, it dropped the trials. Surely euthanasia ranks as important as trialling heroin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also wish to turn briefly to the amendment to be put forward by the member for Longman (Mr Brough). He is proposing to refer this bill to a select committee which will then report back in February 1997. I will be voting against that amendment. I am sure that all members over the last few months have had time to understand this issue fully. If a select committee took another four or five months to travel around Australia and hear the same views over and over again, I have very great doubts whether that would assist the process at all. I think it is time for us to exercise some courage and vote on the issue. If we had a select committee, the Northern Territory law would continue to be in force while the committee travelled the country listening, listening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During this debate, there will be much talk about opinion polls which show that an overwhelming number of Australians support euthanasia. I was particularly impressed by a letter I received from John Brosnan, who was a prison chaplain for 30 years to many inmates in gaol including Ronald Ryan, the last man to be hanged in Australia. I will quote directly from his letter. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The law will inevitably and unavoidably reach more people than the legislators in the Northern Territory envisaged. The effects of the law will not just reach the patients. Our society cannot avoid the effects on our outlook which come with having killing provided as a solution for those in crisis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I know that the contents of this letter go against the opinion polls. I have been there before. Public opinion polls today continue to show substantial support for capital punishment. A referendum to reintroduce capital punishment would be difficult to defeat. No doubt, the same applies to euthanasia. Justice is not established by referenda.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The issue will not be easy for Parliamentarians to resolve but my previous experience with state sanctioned killing leaves me in no doubt. Any experiment with state sanctioned killing will have <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> its most devastating impact on those who are the most vulnerable.</PARA>
<PARA>The issue of euthanasia goes across party lines. It is an issue which goes to the heart of Australian society. People of goodwill will argue both sides of the case here, and I think it is right that they should do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To me, what this issue boils down to is this: should one person be actively involved in the death of another? My emphatic answer to that question is no, and I therefore have much pleasure in seconding the motion. I call on the House to support the bill and vote down the Northern Territory legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the short time that we have this afternoon, it will be very difficult for me to pick up the points made by the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) and the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay). What the honourable member for Menzies did not say was that the Northern Territory legislation is about the rights of the terminally ill. It is about people having rights.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Watson went through his deliberation and referred to the Euthanasia Laws Bill. That bill has been presented by the honourable member for Menzies. In the Northern Territory, the relevant legislation is called the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995, and that gives people the right to consider. I thank the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) for her remarks and for not speaking for the bill as introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is with a great feeling of sadness, and an even greater sense of determination, that I rise today to oppose the bill in the strongest terms and to advance all the arguments necessary to carry an amendment which I will later put to defeat this bill. Twenty years ago I was privileged and honoured to be elected to the first of the two new parliaments created in this country for 73 years. That fully elected legislature was brought into being as an act of democratic faith by the Whitlam Labor government. Less than two years later another Prime Minister, a Liberal, promised us self-government. The promises of both Gough Whitlam and Malcolm Fraser were honoured <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5914"> to the letter, just as all members of this House would expect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker Andrew, your own predecessor, and that of the President of the upper house, sat severally in the Speaker's chair in Parliament House, Darwin, and proclaimed the status of Australia's newest place of responsible democracy. Those men, on behalf of the people of Australia and this place, presented the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory with both dispatch boxes and a mace, the latter bearing a coat of arms endorsed by the College of Heraldry and approved personally by Her Majesty the Queen. That mace, Mr Deputy Speaker, is, as you well know, symbolic of the right of her loyal parliaments to make laws within their constitutional power and according to their collective conscience for the wellbeing of their people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suggest that this bill ignores the great traditions of this parliament. It is ill considered. In particular, there is concern that the member for Menzies' proposed legislation could impact upon and render ineffective crucial aspects of the criminal code and other territory legislation, such as the Natural Death Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suggest to honourable members that there are very good reasons to reject the bill as introduced by the honourable member for Menzies. The reasons are that the bill will overturn conventions which have, to now, been considered as essential to the proper working of representative democracy in this country, and that the bill is ill considered and poorly drafted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First, I will speak of conventions. Some commentators&mdash;for example, the editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper on 16 September 1996&mdash;have said that this is not an issue of states rights because the Northern Territory, the Australian Capital Territory and Norfolk Island are not states. I agree. The matter is more fundamental than that. It goes to the heart of how parliament works. It goes to the conventions that make representative democracy possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The convention of not interfering with the proper exercise of power by another legislature has been one of the fundamental princi ples of this parliament. That convention has long been recognised and applied in this place. In the 1974 report on constitutional development by the Joint Committee on the Northern Territory, it was noted at page 8 that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst the Australian Parliament can undo what a previous Parliament has enacted in respect to constitutional development in its Territories . . . the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department states that this has not happened in Australia's history . . . that it would be politically unthinkable . . . and would only be done in times of revolt or disorder.</PARA>
<PARA>I can assure honourable members that neither of those conditions currently exists in the Northern Territory. In fact, in evidence to the committee, the Commonwealth Attorney&hyphen;General's Department went even further in defence of this convention, when it said at page 583 of the evidence:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would be unthinkable for (a power) to be taken back unless some catastrophe came . . . violent bloodshed or something occurred . . . or the Legislative Assembly broke up in disorder.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>If this bill is ever allowed to pass into law, this parliament and the political parties represented here will never again be able to depend on these conventions. Today's happenings are being watched by all the states and territories of this country. Let me assure the states that there is absolutely no difference in result between a territory law being overturned using section 122 of the constitution and a law of the states being cast aside under the external affairs powers granted by section 51.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now turn to the impact of the bill on other laws. I did take the time and effort to seek competent legal opinions because I had been advised that this bill was poorly drafted. I have been provided with a copy of advice from Mr Rex Wild QC, the Director of Public Prosecutions in the Northern Territory. I have also been provided with advice from Mr Tom Pauling QC, the Solicitor&hyphen;General for the Northern Territory, and from Mr David Bennett QC of Sydney. These learned gentlemen have been willing to provide signed written advice through the Attorney&hyphen;General of the Northern Territory. I seek leave to table those opinions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable members will see that the advice from the Director of Public Prosecutions is to the effect that the legislation proposed by the member for Menzies could, if enacted, have serious consequences for the operation of the criminal law in the Northern Territory. In fact, Mr Wild QC says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a matter of strict law . . . no medical practitioner would be entitled to involve himself in any way with a conscious decision to allow a patient to die if the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act of 1995 is invalidated.</PARA>
<PARA>Further, he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do have concerns about the possible impact of the Bill on the administration of justice in the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Bennett QC was asked, in part, whether:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill . . . if passed . . . will operate to invalidate any law authorising or permitting the administration with double effect of a substance to a terminally ill patient?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Bennett simply said yes. Mr Pauling QC, the Solicitor&hyphen;General for the Northern Territory, concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst the framers of the Bill have attempted to deal with the problems previously identified by the Territory I am not at all satisfied that aspects of Territory law will not be thrown into disarray.</PARA>
<PARA>Academics are also concerned about this bill. For example, the Dean of the Faculty of Law at the Northern Territory University has said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I notice that the member for Menzies has obtained a legal opinion, which has now been distributed. It is an opinion of a formerly well&hyphen;known person to this place, Mr Tom Hughes QC.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first observation one must make is that Tom Hughes, when he was in the business of advising governments, would not have approved of this bill. Tom Hughes, a former Solicitor&hyphen;General, understood the conventions relating to parliamentary practice and would be horrified at a proposal that has one parliament put aside a validly made law of another.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have opinions by four equally qualified lawyers&mdash;three of whom say that this proposal may have adverse effects upon the criminal law and the other law of the Northern Territory, with one saying that they are all wrong.

And neither do I. But I will tell you what I do know: our collective ignorance spells trouble.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make no comment on the position any individual takes on euthanasia. I suggest it is not relevant to this debate, although I must admit that I have been impressed by such powerful advocates of euthanasia as Professor Peter Baume, Dr Roger Hunt and Dr Robert Maher, who spoke so well to some honourable members here on 12 September. Their press release states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any action will overturn the properly constituted law of another Parliament and hence open a Pandora's box of federal interference.</PARA>
<PARA>Professor Baume has a distinguished record in this parliament. He stated quite forcefully that it would be unthinkable to damage convention in the manner proposed by this bill. This is outrageous, I would respectfully suggest, especially when not one member of this parliament sought to overturn the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act within the period of six months allowed by the self&hyphen;government act. In fact, in February 1996 the office of the then Prime Minister wrote a letter to the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5916"> President of the Northern Territory Voluntary Euthanasia Society. Part of that letter states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth Government believes the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995 is a valid law of the Northern Territory and that it is up to the people of the Northern Territory to express their views on that legislation rather than the Commonwealth.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I remind the House of the detailed consideration of euthanasia by the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory. Honourable members would know from the correspondence that I have provided that there were some 1,126 submissions, 814 of which were in favour of euthanasia. That particular correspondence went through from 22 February 1995 to 28 June 1996&mdash;quite a time when compared with the hasty introduction of the bill in this House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been clearly established that this bill is not about the merits or otherwise of euthanasia, nor the ascendancy of one person's moral judgment over another's. It is about an attempt to destroy a convention which commenced in this country with the grant of local authority to a legislature in New South Wales at the beginning of the reign of Queen Victoria 150 years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a bill which will determine the continuance or otherwise of a priceless convention, a convention which has survived the establishment of each of the other colonies of this country. This convention has been honoured during the creation of this nation itself by the Palace of Westminster. Not once in 150 years has a parliament of Great Britain or Australia failed&mdash;no matter what the issue&mdash;to understand the essential value and the paramountcy of the convention which has always safeguarded the right of a duly elected parliament to make laws for the peace, order and good government of its people in accordance with law and its collective conscience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the people and history will say of the 38th Parliament of Australia will be determined here in this debate. I ask all honourable members to join me in ensuring the defeat of this terrible bill. I move:</PARA>

<PARA>I thank all honourable members for their indulgence this afternoon. I can only stress to them that this constitutional attack on the Northern Territory by way of a private member's bill is certainly something that should not be supported, because if a private member can undo what has been done properly for many, many years there is no reason why another private member cannot come into this place and do exactly the same, not only to the Northern Territory but to any other state of Australia. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like other members of this House, I sadly have seen my share of death and of people dying of terminal illnesses&mdash;AIDS, leukaemia, cancer in various forms&mdash;and it is something that has affected me, as I am sure it has affected those in the House who have also had the same experience. I have seen the extreme pain, the loss of dignity, the loss of quality of life that often goes with such circumstances, but also I have seen the enormous courage, the enormous hope, the refusal to give up hope, the refusal to accept defeat that is so much part of the human condition and so much part of the strength of the will to live in these circumstances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I accept that on occasion there are situations where it is clear that death is inevitable; that the person has a terminal condition against which nothing can be done to prevent death; and, that the person concerned is suffering so badly and is in such extreme circumstances that they desire death, they hope for death and that somebody does assist them&mdash;a doctor or another medical professional&mdash;in attaining <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5917"> release. It is very difficult for any of us to regard that as in some way morally wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there is a very different question at stake here; that is, not whether in some individual circumstances there is something morally wrong, but whether the state should legalise and indeed can safely legalise such practices. This debate should not be about one or two individual experiences, not about our own experiences, but about the broader social question. Just as the question of capital punishment cannot be determined by one or two murders, by one or two gross and appalling examples of killing, neither should our view on euthanasia be determined by our own experiences of one or two personal tragedies. We must look beyond those experiences to the broader view of the interests of society at large and the interests of the individuals who make up society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I first approached this issue a couple of years ago when writing a newspaper column. I worked my way through the issue and came to the conclusion that I was opposed to euthanasia and, if anything, the debate that has ensued subsequently has strengthened my view. I think our views on this issue very much come from our own individual natures, our own characteristics, our own perspectives; and our response very much depends on how we look at things, the angle from which we come at any particular issue. I do not have a particularly absolutist view on this issue; I am open to further debate. But faced with the option of the status quo or legalised euthanasia in the form that is proposed in the Northern Territory, then I prefer the status quo.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been argued that this bill put forward by the member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) is about the separation between church and state. I would disagree with that analysis. I think it is also worth noting that just because the churches take a particular view does not therefore make it wrong. Most of us would probably agree with the churches on a few fundamental issues like murder, rape, assault and so forth. So whether the churches take a position is really neither here nor there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To me this is an issue about the relationship between state and citizen&mdash;not between church and state. It is interesting that the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> context of the debate has in some ways presented this bill as unusual. What is unusual is the Northern Territory legislation. The Andrews bill is unusual procedurally, but the substance of the issue&mdash;which is what we should be really about&mdash;is that it is the Northern Territory legislation that is unusual.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am troubled by euthanasia because I think it is virtually impossible to draw safe boundaries, because I think it is virtually impossible to prevent abuses and mistakes and because I think it is virtually impossible to justify offering the option of assisted suicide to one category of people when you deny it to others. That is a necessary implication of the Northern Territory legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I regard individual freedom in our society as essentially very fragile, as very vulnerable to misuse of state and bureaucratic power. Intrinsically, the state assuming the right to sanction killing of a citizen, for whatever reason, troubles me a great deal. Even with apparent consent, it worries me. I refer those in my part of the political spectrum, most of whom have a different point of view from me, to debates that have occurred on issues like the Australia Card, where the same sorts of concerns about fears of misuse&mdash;obviously not on the same life or death scale, but fundamentally the same framework&mdash;occurred. Others laughed and said, `You are paranoid, it is excessive,' and the like, but many on the Left had the same sorts of concerns there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very conscious of human fallibility, very conscious of the fact that euthanasia inevitably focuses on the most vulnerable members of our community. For those who think that `voluntary' amounts to an unimpeachable protection, I ask them to look at one or two examples where capital punishment has been meted out to people who have actually confessed to crimes they did not commit. The case of Timothy Evans in Britain in the early 1950s is a very good example of how, in certain circumstances, the protection of a person having to ask to be killed may not quite be as strong as you think. It is very notable that the parliamentary inquiries that have examined these issues have <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5918"> very much focused on these concerns as a basis for rejecting euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also concerned at the nature of the boundary. Why is it that it is only the terminally ill? Why shouldn't it also be the severely disabled? For example, why shouldn't somebody who has been rendered quadriplegic have the opportunity to opt for assisted suicide? Why not somebody with an incurable mental illness that perhaps makes their life as unbearable or as difficult as a terminal physical illness makes life for the sort of people who are supposedly the subject of this legislation? Why not children who are terminally ill? Why shouldn't they have their guardian make the decision on their behalf, as we do, in so many circumstances in our society, allow an adult to make a decision on behalf of a child?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once this principle is established, it becomes very hard to draw lines. If you look at the detail of the legislation, for example, you will see that it is possible for somebody with a condition as relatively uncomplicated in modern terms as diabetes, if they refuse treatment, to then have that as a basis for achieving assisted suicide. I am not suggesting that that will necessarily happen, but I am using it as an illustration of how difficult it is to draw boundaries around these things which are safe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why is it that, on one hand, we put so much effort and concern into telling some people, `Don't kill yourself,' and we have so much concern now about youth suicide, yet on the other hand we are now shifting into a pattern where we are going to help certain other people, in effect, to commit suicide? There is an inherent subjectivity in all of this, and that is about the quality of life for people. It involves a subjective judgment which says that certain people in certain circumstances of a particular nature inherently have a lesser quality of life and therefore we are going to permit assisted suicide for those people, but not for other people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> If you look through the list of criteria in Marshall Perron's little flow chart which he sent around, you will see things which, when you read them carefully, are inherently subjective. `Have the implications been con sidered by the patient? Has the proper information been provided by the medical practitioner?' Any decision to opt for assisted suicide cannot be taken in isolation from the current mental state of the person, the quality of the care they are receiving, the attitudes of the carers, the attitudes of the family and friends whom they are with every day and, ultimately, the financial imperatives in the health system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is impossible, in my view, to guarantee a genuinely pure decision to die based purely on the factors that are beyond human control, namely, the terminal illness. It will be inevitable that other factors which are within human control may impinge on such a decision. The emphasis on palliative care in our health system may be subtly altered as a result of the distorting signal that support for euthanasia sends through. Individuals may succumb to subtle pressure, or even imagined pressure, to do the right thing by relatives or even the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that throughout this whole debate nobody has actually asked the question: what about the terminally ill who don't want to die? What impact does this have on those people who say, `No, I want to live, I want to hang in there and I want every bit of assistance I can have'? The message that this sends to those people is: you are downgraded in some way; you are devalued.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We could even see situations where changes in health funding, changes to Medicare, could insert a substantial financial part into this equation which currently is not there. That is a big worry, in my view. If people ultimately are faced with choices such as, `Do I have to spend my children's inheritance to maintain my care?' then all of a sudden you have got a real problem with an equation that has got a capacity for assisted suicide there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anyone who scoffs at these concerns&mdash;the concerns about distorting signals being inserted into a bureaucratic organisational structure&mdash;and thinks they will have no impact should read some of the aviation safety reports that have been going around recently as a good illustration of what can happen when you have got some sort of subtle cultural change being inserted into a system that is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5919"> designed to protect, to care, to preserve life, and see what can happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These may be exaggerated fears. They may come from my own personal views, personal perspectives, but everybody's view in this debate will ultimately come from that gut level set of values, which will be the base from which we approach these things. My concern is that you will get these distortions&mdash;not overnight, maybe not next year or in two years time, but eventually you will get them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The argument in favour of euthanasia in this debate essentially rests on three key themes: individual rights, states rights and the fact that it happens anyway. In this great age of individualism, it is perhaps not surprising that the line of individual choice scores very well in opinion polls and that euthanasia is getting 75 to 80 per cent in the opinion polls. I think it is worth pointing out to some of those behind me, including some in my own faction, that the same theme also ensures that there are lots of people out there from whom, when you put the proposition to them, `Should individual workers have the right to negotiate their contract with their boss,' you get the same sort of result. It depends very much on what question you ask.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we went to a referendum, I suspect, as was the case with the Communist Party Dissolution Bill in the early 1950s, that majority in the polls would shrink very quickly and you would get a very hard fought and difficult contest. There are many areas in our society where we inhibit individual freedom. I refer, for example, to the ability to contract out of workers' compensation obligations. We do not let people do that. The honourable member for Menzies mentioned the ability to allow someone to commit grievous bodily harm to oneself. We do not permit people the individual right to do that. There are a whole range of things there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this is ultimately about is the balance between the individual and the community in our society. I do not believe, in this debate or in any other, that we should start with the premise that the individual is supreme. That is the underlying logical effect of the starting point for the pro&hyphen;euthanasia position.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The weakest line in the argument in favour of euthanasia in this debate is the states rights line. It is an absolute absurdity that we are now in a position where the same set of conduct in Darwin is legal but in Mount Isa it is illegal. The same set of conduct in Broken Hill is illegal but it is legal in Alice Springs. It is absurd that a parliament that represents roughly one per cent of Australians should, in effect, make a decision that affects all Australians on an issue of such fundamental importance. For those who push this line, I would like to ask them: where were you a couple of years ago when this parliament legislated to overrule the Tasmanian parliament on the question of personal privacy?<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Exactly the same issues were there. This parliament had the constitutional power, and it used it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where would you be if this were not about euthanasia but about capital punishment? I suspect that there would be some who would be only too happy, too ready, to join in overruling the Northern Territory parliament should it decide to reintroduce capital punishment. I support a uniform national position, whether it be by referendum, by legislation in this parliament in concert with the states or whatever. We should have a single uniform national position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the question of `It happens anyway' this is the strongest argument, I must concede, on the part of the supporters of euthanasia. It is a difficult one for me because on other issues, for example the drug question, I think it is a very powerful point. But I think you have to look at these things on an issue by issue basis. The status quo may be unsatisfactory, but I believe that full legalisation in the case of euthanasia would lead to a worse situation. In some respects I would say the same of heroin. The status quo is unsatisfactory. The criminal law being involved is the core part of the problem with heroin use. But if we went to complete legalisation I think in many respects we would have a worse situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is difficult to know what the intermediate point in how you deal with these things is but, faced with a choice of the status quo or legalisation, I will stick with the status quo. I have had some dark warnings of: `This is all <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5920"> a Lyons Forum conspiracy' and the Catholic Right and so forth and what am I doing on board with all these people. The spectrum in this community that is opposed to euthanasia is much wider than just the so-called Catholic Right. Other churches&mdash;for example, the Anglican Church&mdash;have taken the same position. It is also notable if you look internationally that euthanasia, unlike abortion, is illegal virtually throughout the world. What that ought to tell us is that, regardless of religion, regardless of orientation, there is a very wide spectrum of opinion opposed to euthanasia across the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I seek leave to table the Hughes advice that the member for the Northern Territory referred to. If his advice is not correct, there is one simple way of solving it, and that is mutual repeal. If this parliament passes this act then the Northern Territory parliament has a simple solution to those alleged problems. It could then repeal the right to die act and we will then consequentially repeal this act. So there is a simple way to solve those problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My final concern is that the Northern Territory law is a clear indication that there are two types of people, that there is not equality before the law with respect to these issues, that society values some citizens differently. If you are terminally ill then you are permitted access to assisted suicide but not if you are in another category. I think this fits in with a pattern that is extending right across our whole polity, right across many decisions to reduce people to atoms, to individuals, to take decisions that are not based on the society as a whole. I believe we should support the bill of the member for Menzies. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This debate is hard&mdash;real hard. It is hard because it is about death. Most people are uncomfortable talking about dying. Even the most hardened politician, with the lobbying going on around this place in the last few days, shifts in their seat and pauses on the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> phone as to what their view is. This is understandable because most of us avoid confronting death until we absolutely have to. But if anything is certain it is that the experience of death from this life will be universal. So this debate, as hard as it may be, is important. The outcome come of this debate will reflect on our maturity both as a parliament and as a nation for it will determine the manner in which we seek to control each other's lives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I oppose this bill because I support human dignity. I oppose this bill because I support freedom of choice. I oppose this bill because I support civil liberties. I oppose this bill because my Christian upbringing taught me that compassion is important. I oppose this bill because modern medical practice should be open and accountable, not covert and dishonest. I oppose this bill because I believe that the national parliament should only intervene against the state or territory legislature when there is overwhelming public support to do so on a national level. I oppose this bill because I oppose the moral posturing of the Lyons Forum. I oppose the hypocrisy of those who say, `This debate is so important' and then vote to debate it upstairs in sideshow alley.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most importantly, I oppose this bill for one critical reason, and that is this. We have all accepted that this parliamentary debate should be a matter for our conscience. How arrogant to then suggest that the ability to exercise conscience should be taken from a terminally ill patient who wants to die. There is nothing moral about our exercising a free conscience vote as members of parliament and then voting to deny to others the right to exercise their conscience. What possible right do Kevin Andrews, Leo McLeay, Lindsay Tanner or Anthony Albanese have to have exercised Bob Dent's conscience for him? It was his decision and he had a right to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One might expect, given the strength of some members' points of view in this debate, that voluntary euthanasia is not practised in Australia. We all know that it is. It has been ever since the advent of conventional medicine. Indeed, a survey conducted in Victoria in 1987 revealed that approximately 14 per cent of all medical practitioners admitted to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5921"> performing active voluntary euthanasia. A survey conducted some six years later in New South Wales indicated similar results. If one looks behind these statistics, one finds that over 7,000 registered medical practitioners have assisted their patients to die. The real figure, I would suggest, is much higher. They have broken the law. So either we should charge them or we should change the law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is fortunate that some terminally ill people have been in a position to have their desire to end their pain agreed to by compassionate medical practitioners. However, this has occurred in an environment which is neither regulated nor entirely foolproof. To those who would argue that there is no need to legalise euthanasia because it is already occurring, they are simply endorsing covert procedures that embody many more dangers than the Northern Territory act would ever permit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Marshall Perron, the former Chief Minister for the Northern Territory, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is surely preferable to have voluntary euthanasia tolerated in specific circumstances with stringent safeguards and a degree of transparency, than to continue to prohibit it officially while allowing it to be carried out in secret beyond any form of control.</PARA>
<PARA>The Northern Territory act sets in place strict criteria for a person to become eligible for euthanasia. It demands that persons seeking euthanasia have a mind which is sound but a body which is suffering from a terminal illness. There are over a dozen steps that both patient and practitioner need to satisfy before becoming entitled to use the act. In a system such as that in place in the Northern Territory, there are safeguards on top of safeguards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to those in the community who would mount religious or moral arguments against the Northern Territory act, reliable evidence suggests that they do not represent mainstream opinion. If one tracks support in the Australian community for voluntary euthanasia, they will find that support over the last decade has been over 70 per cent in favour with approximately 15 per cent against. The remaining percentage constitutes those undecided. The latest polls have confirmed this. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> The Newspoll survey in July of this year showed 75 per cent in favour and 18 per cent against. A Morgan poll last month showed 76 per cent in favour, 17 per cent against and seven per cent undecided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> One poll result may be wrong, possibly two, but every poll taken of the Australian community in the last decade has resulted in resounding support for voluntary euthanasia. It does not stand to reason that we should be resisting the will of the Australian community in such a blatant fashion. We should strongly resist the emergence in Australian politics of the moral minority.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also does not stand to reason that we should seek to play a part in willingly prolonging the agony and despair of people whose illnesses we do not, and hopefully will not, share.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Together with community support for voluntary euthanasia, a 1994 postal survey of almost 1,300 doctors registered in New South Wales and the ACT showed that a majority of 58 per cent of respondents believed the law should be changed to allow active voluntary euthanasia. Therefore, we find that when the general community and health professionals have an opportunity to express their views they invariably support amendments to the law that make voluntary euthanasia permissible. We as public representatives must take seriously the view of the electorate. If the general electorate and those who might actually have an involvement in voluntary euthanasia strongly support its availability, then who are we to stand in its way?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> None of us here knows first&hyphen;hand the spirit sapping pain of terminal illness. None of us can comprehend the solitude and agony of coping with endless pain&mdash;from chronic bed sores to internal pain that no amount of morphine can allay. It would be an injustice to those whose illnesses have advanced to the stage where they believe their life is devoid of quality and beyond repair to say, `No, you cannot choose the time in which you depart this world. I'll decide it for you What self&hyphen;righteous hypocrisy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Suffering of this sort destroys a person's very fibre&mdash;their physical, psychological and spiritual wellbeing. Is it not just a final insult to an individual's integrity, rights and dignity <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5922"> to say to them they have no autonomy when it comes to ending their suffering? Yet this is an all too obvious consequence should this bill be approved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know and have known people suffering terminal illness. It is emotionally draining to watch someone fade away. What I find particularly disturbing is the fact that they have had no control over their destiny. This is for the most part all predetermined by well&hyphen;meaning medical staff in collaboration with their family, if they are lucky enough to have one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Many patients are provided with every possible life prolonging contingency so they may live another day or another week. I say to those who wish this to occur, `That is your choice. You are entitled to it.' But for those people&mdash;and there are many&mdash;who do wish to see the voluntary euthanasia legislation continue this option should be given to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The opponents of voluntary euthanasia should not see it as a threat to their rights. Indeed, this act has no application to them. There is, however, a significant number of terminally ill patients who would be comforted by knowing that this option was available if the pain became just too much. To those who say that legalising voluntary euthanasia is placing too much power in doctors' hands, I argue the reverse. I think it is symptomatic that you have doctors in this House who have practised voluntary euthanasia but who are voting for the Andrews bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The measures in place in the Northern Territory not only safeguards patients' rights but empower those patients to make critical decisions about their treatment. I invite anyone to mount a plausible argument that says patients should not determine their course of treatment, whatever its form. The argument that there is a distinction between actions such as withdrawing life support or pumping morphine into a patient and voluntary euthanasia is at best a technical one. More often than not it is just false. This argument is designed to make those who remain alive feel comfortable about the process of death.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> This brings me to the issue of palliative care. Palliative care may make life more <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> bearable in some instances, but as Professor Baume, a distinguished former minister, said last year in the ninth Lionel Murphy Memorial Lecture:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But even the best palliative care will not help everyone . . . there will be some people whose symptoms and distress continue, whose suffering is unrelieved, and who are condemned, as the law stands now, to suffer and to endure until they are lucky enough to die.</PARA>
<PARA>It is worth noting that since the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act has become law in the Northern Territory, the number of people in palliative care has increased by over 250 per cent. Funding has increased from $500,000 last year to $1.04 million this year. So much for that argument. If Kevin Andrews is fair dinkum, he would have amended his bill to increase palliative care funding instead of voting for a 10 per cent cut in the budget. That is the sort of hypocrisy which really turns people off in this debate. He is not fair dinkum. The extreme right&hyphen;wing moralists never are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Honourable members should be aware that a consequence of denying terminally ill people the right to choose when they die is that they may elect to commit suicide. Sometimes, if a doctor cannot or will not assist, this situation gives rise to clumsy and tragic suicide attempts. Fortunately, there are many doctors who appreciate these risks and who are prepared to act compassionately and responsibly to assist a person to die. But, of course, it is the wealthy and the better informed within our community who generally have access to that. In effect, the covert operations give an advantage to the affluent within our community, for they can always find someone to assist them. Meanwhile, the less well off continue to live with unbearable pain. Covert medical practices are never equitable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those who reduce this debate to one about unscrupulous family members chasing dying relatives' money or those who claim that life is sacred and under no circumstances should it be brought to an end are infringing on our sensibilities and the human rights of people who are dying. The logic of this `the kids will knock off their parents' argument reflects <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5923"> badly and, I believe, inaccurately on our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Far from undermining the respect due to human life, the Northern Territory act enshrines a new range of rights and liberties for those burdened with the debilitating effects of terminal illness. This bill removes the prospect of compassionate and humane relief being granted to people who have had enough. A theme of my speech has been to ask members of this chamber whether we have the right to judge persons who might elect to put an end to their intolerable pain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Politicians spend their parliamentary lives judging what is right and wrong for the community, and the community spend a great proportion of their lives being subject to these decisions. I contend that the right to choose the time of one's death, when faced with an advancing disease, is a personal one. It should be outside the scope of this parliament to remove from one's grasp the right to choose when and how they deal with their burden.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bob Dent's last letter is a sobering personal account, and I will conclude my remarks with this. In it he noted his four years of struggle against cancer. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">My own pain is made worse by watching my wife suffering as she cares for me, bathing and drying me, cleaning up after my `accidents' in the middle of the night and watching my body waste away. If I were to keep a pet animal in the same condition I am in, I would be prosecuted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I read with increasing horror newspaper stories of Kevin Andrews' attempt to overturn the most compassionate piece of legislation in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The church and the state must remain separate. What right has anyone because of their own religious faith (to which I don't subscribe) to demand that I behave according to rules until some omnipotent doctor decides that I must have had enough and goes ahead and increases my morphine until I die? If you disagree with voluntary euthanasia, then don't use it, but don't deny me the right to use it if and when I want to.</PARA>
<PARA>To intervene at that point in someone's life is unconscionable. I oppose this bill and call upon all members of the House to do so.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the member for Longman from moving forthwith a motion to vary the resolution of the House of 8 October 1996 concerning the arrangements applying to the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996 by omitting paragraphs (2) to (5) and substituting the following paragraphs:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> at the conclusion of the proceedings on the bill in the House on Monday, 28 October 1996, the bill being referred to a select committee appointed by this resolution to consider the bill, to report to the House by Friday, 28 February 1997; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> other elements relating to the powers and proceedings of the select committee appointed by paragraph (2) being proposed in a subsequent resolution.</PARA>
<PARA>The reason I have called for this suspension of standing and sessional orders is that, up until now, there has been a lot of emotive debate but very little informed debate. I have listened today to speakers who believe wholeheartedly in their point of view. Unfortunately I guess for me and for those 30-odd per cent of members in this chamber who are yet to make up their minds, they do not believe the debate has reached such a height at this point or such a degree of accuracy that they can make that decision. I do not believe that we should have only a conscience vote on this issue; we should have a conscience vote and an informed vote. At present, I believe that is lacking in many members within this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To the best of my knowledge, there has not been a parliament anywhere in the world which has considered this debate, this issue, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5924"> and not had a parliamentary inquiry. The very reason these committees are set up is so that we can avail ourselves of these mechanisms so we have all the information available to us&mdash;not only that which has been sent to us under emotional circumstances from those on both sides of the debate. Unlike anywhere else in the world, we now have a piece of legislation to deal with. That has never been the case before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation in Holland has been spoken of at great length, but that does not relate to what has happened here in Australia. We do have more than one issue to deal with. I would ask all members of this House on both sides of the debate to consider their position and to consider whether or not, just because they have a position in mind, they should deny the rest of the members of this parliament the mechanisms of a parliamentary inquiry in order to come to their conclusion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> A very important issue in this debate is the delay. The member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) has pointed out that he wishes this parliament and the Senate to move forthwith to a conclusion, and I support him wholeheartedly in that. We do not want to see another life taken whilst this bill goes through the procedures of this House and of the Senate. However, I would put to all members that we are going to rise from this place in early December and will not return to this parliament until February. It will not be until February or March that this legislation will finally come before the Senate. What is to happen to those people in the Northern Territory who currently wait for their lethal injection over that time? Whilst we merrily holiday, they go through their pain and their uncertainty of what this House and the Senate is choosing to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My point is that we, as responsible politicians and representatives of our constituents, should take it upon ourselves to use every day available to ensure that we get the outcomes necessary to bring this debate to an end. You can be assured that the Senate will have an inquiry and we will have lost the opportunity in December and January&mdash;that valuable time when people's lives will be at risk. Surely, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> those who support the honourable member for Menzies can understand that point of view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is my belief that if we do not have a select committee set up this day&mdash;a committee which can take evidence and report back to this parliament, evidence the Senate can also avail itself of&mdash;we are not being serious about expediting things in the best manner possible. On those grounds, I ask every member of this House to search their conscience and ensure that they are making their decisions not on political grounds or from some personal point of view but for the betterment of Australia and to ensure that we make the right choice. I commend my motion to the House.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members will be aware also that four opinions by learned QCs have been tabled in this House and that there is considerable disagreement among them as to the legal effects of the bill. The House needs to seek its own advice, with the assistance of the Attorney&hyphen;General. It should not debate legislation when it lacks a clear understanding of just what it would be legislating for. In addition, the House needs to weigh up seriously the legitimate concerns raised about the wisdom of overturning 150 years of parliamentary convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Principled opposition to this bill has come from numerous sources. The Northern Territory legislature took the formal step of presenting a remonstrance. The leaders' forum rejected the bill on principle. As recently as 20 October, the annual council of the Liberal Party of Australia considered that the matter was one for the states and territories. The remonstrance presented to the House and the Senate yesterday was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Northern Territory having been granted self&hyphen;governing powers, the duly elected representatives <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5925"> of the people of the Northern Territory are aggrieved that there should be any attempt to diminish those powers by the proposed enactment of the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996.</PARA>
<PARA>In this remonstrance they were ably supported by the Australian Capital Territory and Norfolk Island. Premiers and Chief Ministers met in Melbourne on 27 September 1996. The leaders' forum agreed that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Without debating the issue of euthanasia, State and Territory leaders unanimously rejected the proposal before the Commonwealth parliament (the Andrews Bill) to overturn the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995 (Northern Territory).</PARA>
<PARA>In addition, in Hobart on 20 October, just a week ago, the Liberal Party's Federal Council reaffirmed the fundamental legislative rights of the state and territory governments. This decision has been reported variously as `Death veto rebuff', `Lib council backs NT right to pass kill bill' and `Victory for states rights'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I repeat: before embarking on this dangerous frolic, the House should seek its own evidence and legal advice and approach this matter at least as thoroughly as the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory. I commend the motion to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I oppose the motion moved by the member for Longman (Mr Brough). In the course of my remarks, I will formally move an amendment which I have asked the clerk to circulate. The first point I want to make is that I support the bill moved by the member for Menzies (Mr Andrews), and on division in this House I propose to support it. My view on this issue has always been that it is a matter of individual conscience, so far as both procedure and substance are concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been concerned at the procedure which the House has adopted to date and proposes to adopt in the handling of this bill. I believe that the conduct of the House in the handling of this matter goes to the great national expectations that have arisen about this issue of great national conscience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The House has before it three or four avenues of procedure. I want to deal with those and, in the course of my remarks, make some comment on the motion moved by the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> member for Longman and refer the House expressly to my proposed amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first procedure open to the House is that which was flagged by the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) to discharge the bill from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>. The effect of such a motion, if successful, would be to kill the bill before any debate. I was pleased that the member for Hindmarsh did not go down that road because not only would it have killed the bill without debate but also it would have struck me that the member for Hindmarsh had been particularly selfish. Having taken the opportunity of being one of only six members to speak on the bill, her proposal would have deprived any other member of the opportunity to speak. I am pleased that the member for Hindmarsh did not proceed in that way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second avenue available to the House is that proposed by the member for Longman, namely, reference of the bill to a select committee. That approach would be to run away from the debate now. Two essential points go against the motion moved by the member for Longman to establish a select committee. Firstly, the bill presented to the House by the member for Menzies seeks to override the law of a territory. I have no difficulty with that. I subscribe to that quaint, old-fashioned notion that, since there is a Commonwealth head of power, the Commonwealth parliament is entitled to utilise it. I have no difficulty in that respect, but the people of the Northern Territory, the ACT and Norfolk Island are entitled to know sooner rather than later whether this House proposes to interfere and override that legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second essential point is that the House normally moves a matter to a select or standing committee when the House requires judgment to be made on matters on which the House is lacking&mdash;technical matters or matters of expertise&mdash;or matters which have come to the House quickly, without notice, and on which the House might want to pause. This is not such a matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members of this parliament will have been besieged by views on either side of this debate. In one respect, while it is perfectly open to a member over time to change his or <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5926"> her view on this very important matter of conscience, in another respect, if you do not know now you will never know. You do not need the delay which would be imposed by a reference to a select committee to make up your minds on an individual matter of conscience we have been aware of for months and in respect of which many members of this House, because of death among family, friends and loved ones, have been touched personally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So this is not an issue about which the House is surprised. The people of the Northern Territory and Australia are entitled to know sooner rather than later what this House proposes to do. You do not need the luxury of three or four months before a select committee to make up your mind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next procedural avenue open is to continue down the course which the House resolved on 8 October on the motion of the Leader of the House (Mr Reith), which would see this debate conducted in the Main Committee. That would see matters of life and death debated in sideshow alley. The Main Committee is not a venue for such a matter. This is not a non-controversial matter, but one in respect of which one voice of dissent or conscience ought to ensure that the matter is heard in this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a matter of principle, I do not propose under the current arrangements to speak on this bill. I do not propose, and did not seek, to be one of the six who excluded the other 142 members of this chamber thereby making them second&hyphen;class members. I certainly do not propose to skulk up to the Main Committee and speak in sideshow alley. `In the great euthanasia debate of 1996, Dad, where did you speak? Did you skulk off to sideshow alley?' As a matter of principle, I am not proposing to go up to the Main Committee and speak on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the best procedural way open to the House is to adopt the amendment which I now formally move. I move:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"> That all words after "prevent" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"the member for Perth from moving the following motion forthwith: <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That those provisions of the resolution of the House of 8 October 1996 relating to the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996 which have not yet had effect are to have no effect and all further proceedings on the bill shall be conducted in the House for the reasons that the House recognises:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the need to ensure the issues raised by the bill are the subject of national discussion led by the House of Representatives;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the public concern, especially among Territorians, that consideration of the bill as currently proposed would substantially occur outside the House itself; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the course of action proposed for the bill which has not yet had effect is contrary to all established rules and practices covering the operation of the House and its Main Committee".</PARA>
<PARA>I do not propose to traverse the matters about which I have spoken to the House before. I certainly do not want to raise the ire of the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) who has had them from me on two or three occasions. Suffice to say that the dignity and standing of this House, of this parliament and the meeting of community expectations on a great national issue of conscience requires that this chamber itself lead the debate. You cannot do that if you send the bill off to sideshow alley. You cannot do that if you run away from the debate and send it off to a select committee. You cannot do that if you discharge the bill, as the member for Hindmarsh may have been thinking about, without a fulsome debate in this House. All of those avenues diminish this parliament, this debate and the members here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is only one proper approach: this great issue of national conscience ought to be conducted wholesomely, fulsomely and completely in this chamber, to ensure the standing and dignity of this parliament and a proper meeting of community expectations. On this matter there are individual views of conscience: strong views firmly held; strong views emotionally held; strong views sensitively held&mdash;all after careful thought. Those views may change over time and members may want to dwell and reflect upon them. But those views should be expressed, articulated and responded to by the community when they see members do it in this chamber. I commend the amendment to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At this time of free voting I am in the position where I can support the propositions moved by both the member for Longman (Mr Brough) and the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith). I am an opponent of the private member's bill in principle, primarily on the principles of democracy and liberty. I do not claim, however, to be an expert on the detail of the Northern Territory euthanasia laws.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that in this matter the onus of proof and argument is with the mover of the bill. He is the one who wants to take rights from others; he is the one who wants to take democratic rights from 500,000 Territorians in this country; he is the one who wants to take rights from terminally ill people in the Northern Territory. I believe that, until the bill and the mover make that case in principle and detail without any doubt, the parliament is entitled to want more scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was very disappointed to hear in the media yesterday the member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) saying that he thought a select committee would be a waste of time, because that is exactly the charge that Northern Territorians level at him. I think there is a great irony and sadness in the fact that the member for Menzies, having given so much scrutiny to the laws of the Northern Territory, now seems afraid himself to have the legislation he has brought before this House of Representatives subjected to scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that a select committee can play a very productive role. It would not be a waste of time. It would, most importantly, bring scrutiny and detail to the sort of legal <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5928"> arguments that would not otherwise be canvassed in this chamber or in the Main Committee. The legal questions that flow from the issue of the definition of euthanasia and of intention to kill&mdash;and I understand they are currently before the courts in Australia without comprehensive conclusion&mdash;have been put from so many sources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The questions have come from lawyers at the Australian National University, from lawyers we have in our Parliamentary Library who have brought to the attention of members in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bills Digest</EMPHASIS> their concern that this legislation does not have a definition of euthanasia, does not have a definition of intention to kill and does not deal with the complex legal issues currently being bounced around Australian courts and common law on the meaning of `intent'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it was very disappointing that the member for Menzies in his second reading speech just moments ago did not deal with any of those questions. They are criticisms of his bill in its detail that have been brought to bear by lawyers throughout Australia. They have also been raised, I understand, in correspondence with all members in this place by the Attorney&hyphen;General of the Northern Territory. I would have thought that a select committee would be useful&mdash;</PARA>

I am raising the questions that have been raised by many lawyers within this parliamentary precinct and within the Northern Territory&mdash;including the correspondence of the Attorney&hyphen;General to all members&mdash;and by lawyers from universities and other places around the country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am arguing the case for scrutiny on the detail of this private member's bill. I am also <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> arguing for scrutiny through a select committee because essentially euthanasia is new law. Changes in medical technology this century have done two things: they have extended life beyond the normal course of nature, and they have also brought potential to hasten death. It is not unusual that parliaments across the world have used select committees to deal with these new aspects of law responding to new medical technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also think that a select committee would be very useful in dealing with the contradiction between the attempt to strike down the Northern Territory euthanasia laws and the support that this parliament and the government in other places have brought to bear on the question of Northern Territory statehood. For the benefit of the House, I will read the communique of the recent COAG meeting dealing with Northern Territory statehood:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this context the Prime Minister indicated the Commonwealth's willingness to facilitate statehood for the Northern Territory according to a negotiated timetable through a truly cooperative federal partnership.</PARA>
<PARA>There will be a stark contradiction between in&hyphen;principle support for Northern Territory statehood by 2001 and saying in 1996 that they do not have the right to make law with regard to euthanasia. That is a contradiction the parliament could usefully consider through a select committee. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

We do not need a committee to do our thinking for us. We are quite capable of making our minds up on this issue now.

People will be dying while we are talking, and that is why we should reject this motion to suspend standing orders. If we were to delay for another six months, there is no research that we need to do that has not been done and there are no ethical insights that we will get that the Aborigines have not already got.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in this aptly named grievance <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5931"> debate on a matter of real grievance for the people and businesses of my electorate of Blaxland. I am supported in this by the member for Banks (Mr Melham), because the people in the Banks electorate are equally affected by the proposed closure of the Bankstown Taxation Office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The subject of this very real grievance is the decision announced in the ATO Business 2000 statement that the Bankstown Taxation Office would close in the period after 30 June 1998. The `Regional summaries of major impacts' in that document stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To 30 June 1998</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During this period we will be actively marketing the Bankstown site for sub-leasing. Staff will not generally be required to move from Bankstown until sub-leasing is achieved.</PARA>
<PARA>The document continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Post 30 June 1998</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is likely that it will be during this period we will move out of our existing Bankstown site. A new presence for field and public contact will be established to maintain and enhance our service to the local community.</PARA>
<PARA>The general rationale for the Bankstown office to June 1998 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With moves to increase staff density and business line plans to reduce number of sites in each region, the result is a need for less space and branch offices overall. Bankstown has been identified as a site that is unlikely to be required in the medium to longer term, having regard to Bankstown's location between Hurstville and Parramatta for ease of staff movement and the cheaper leasing costs of other sites.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Community expectations for client service will continue to be met. We will be piloting new approaches to the `client services' function in the northern Sydney site(s).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most staff will not need to move until tenant(s) are found and alternative space has been made available in other existing sites. The earliest this is likely to be possible is around January 1998. Some staff . . . will move earlier as a result of line consolidation.</PARA>
<PARA>This is in stark contrast to the draft report some months ago, which recommended not only that the Bankstown Taxation Office should stay but that its staffing should be increased from 644 to 800. The individual taxpayers and small business people of Banks <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> town had the expectation that the significant presence of the ATO in Bankstown would not only remain but be increased.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the past 10 years, the ATO in Bankstown has grown and served its local clients on the basis of the ATO's decentralisation program. Bankstown is now faced with the closure of a major federal government department in what can only be described as a policy of centralisation and contraction from the local point of view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bankstown's individual taxpayers will be faced with long journeys to the ATO offices at Parramatta or Hurstville to deal directly with ATO staff on matters relating to their tax affairs. Small business people in Bankstown will no longer have ready access to a full regional taxation office where their businesses are. The removal of 644 staff from Bankstown to Parramatta and Hurstville will have a very direct detrimental effect on the local economy and small businesses in Bankstown. The Bankstown Taxation Office provided an employment ballast in the Bankstown area, and it attracted further private accounting business to Bankstown because it was a full regional office capable of resolving tax matters at the local level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know the difference the loss of the Taxation Office will make to Bankstown because I know what taxation services were like prior to the former Labor government introducing its decentralisation program. The purpose of decentralisation was to move ATO offices closer to where clients are and closer to where clients live. A further advantage of decentralisation was that ATO staff could live close to where they work instead of being stuck in the Sydney central business district. I well remember the Sydney South Office in Hunter Street, Sydney, which housed 5,000 taxation officers. The cost to the ATO of these CBD offices was high, the travel cost in both money and time for staff was high and the environmental demands on Sydney's public transport systems were significant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5932"> The ATO's decentralisation campaign made real sense. It moved its taxation officers out into the suburbs of Sydney close to where the staff lived, which meant that transport costs for staff were minimised as was their travel ling time. It also meant the taxation officers who were involved in field work were much closer to the industries and businesses they had to investigate. This involved great savings in travel time and greater efficiency for the operations of the ATO. This was especially significant for Bankstown's Taxation Office because Bankstown is such a major industrial and commercial centre. The city of Bankstown has a population close to that of Hobart, and it rightly deserves to have a full taxation office to serve the needs of individual taxpayers, small and large businesses and the efficiencies embodied in the ATO's decentralisation program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the early 1980s Bankstown had a taxation office. It had a staff of seven, closeted in rabbit hutch conditions with the Customs Service in an office in Stanley Street, Bankstown. The office was difficult to find, inadequate in terms of staffing and accommodation and incapable of addressing the needs of the people and businesses of Bankstown. The ATO's recognition of the inherent inadequacy of these arrangements led to the establishment of a staged development of a full taxation office in Bankstown. The first stage of that development was an office of 150 ATO staff situated in Rickard Road, Bankstown. This was followed by the opening of the full Australian Taxation Office in Meredith Street, Bankstown, in a leased building which was built to ATO security standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people of Bankstown were pleased that the ATO's decentralisation program had led to the establishment of a fully empowered and fully operating taxation office in Bankstown. The people of Bankstown understood the local economic benefits of this office and they appreciated the convenience of accessing ATO services locally. The people of Bankstown had the quite reasonable expectation that the office would continue to operate efficiently and effectively as it had from its inception. This expectation was buttressed by the ATO's draft plan which was released a few months ago and which stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current staffing level in Bankstown is 664. The ATO&hyphen;Business 2000 plan proposes 800. The increase will be accommodated by increased density of workpoints at the Bankstown site and changed work practices. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>Between the draft report and the final statement the decision to close the Bankstown office was taken. The draft report was clear and unambiguous that Bankstown rightfully had a place, that it would continue and that it should be increased in staffing level by 156 people. Its future seemed to be assured and soundly based. It cannot have been decided on the basis of reductions in staff numbers due to technological changes as this was already the basis of the draft report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rationale underlying the final report was that the ATO `would not use technology to retreat into the back room. Rather we will use the resources freed up by these developments to put more people into jobs dealing directly with the community on their individual issues&mdash;giving a more human face to the ATO'. Closing the Bankstown Taxation Office after June 1998 will, for Bankstown, mean that the backroom is bulldozed and the human face of the ATO will be removed from the city of Bankstown almost entirely. The only concession made by the ATO in a letter to the member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) on 16 October 1996 was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in the medium term we are looking to move out of our current offices in Bankstown and Cheltenham (Melbourne), while making sure that we maintain client service delivery for Individuals Non&hyphen;Business and the Child Support Agency in those areas through alternative methods.</PARA>
<PARA>In that same letter, Mr Peter Simpson, the Second Commissioner of Taxation, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The original proposal has been changed significantly, taking into account extensive feedback received from ATO staff, Members of Parliament and community representatives and ATO business needs now and into the future.</PARA>
<PARA>I can only wonder whether the present Treasurer, the member for Higgins (Mr Costello), was one of those members of parliament making an input into the decision making process on ATO Business 2000. I can think of no other ready explanation for a significant taxation office such as Bankstown being retained at the draft stage and then peremptorily axed in the final decision than that it was a mean&hyphen;spirited, vindictive intervention by the Treasurer against the maintenance of the Bankstown office, because it was established <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5933"> in Bankstown during the time of the former Treasurer, the Hon. Paul Keating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps I am wrong but it is entirely in concert with the drive of this coalition government to abandon direct service provision by the Commonwealth Public Service and to drive towards those service functions being provided by the private sector through outsourcing. The tremors of this drive are already evident in the ATO Business 2000 document. The overview of accommodation argues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The difference between current best practice of around 15 square metres and our existing holdings is the equivalent of 1,200 staff.</PARA>
<PARA>Put another way, if we were to accommodate their existing staff&mdash;</PARA>

<TIME.STAMP>(8.11 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to bring to the attention of the House the growing problem of the ownership of intellectual property in our country. As we move further and further into an age of high technology and global computer networks it is becoming increasingly important to protect the literary, artistic, scientific and industrial <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> creations that we develop as a nation. These creations are known as intellectual property and their ownership is determined by intellectual property rights.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all come face to face every day with intellectual property rights. The music that plays over the radio is subject to copyright, the food we eat is covered by brand name trademarks, the newspapers we read are subject to copyright, the clothes we wear may be covered by design rights, the cars we drive are registered designs, much of the equipment and gadgets we use are subject to patents and the formula in some of these products may be subject to a trade secret.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the laws we have in Australia to protect intellectual property rights are no longer adequate. We go to great lengths to protect people's rights to own land and goods but we do not invest the same amount of resources in protecting people's ideas, inventions and creative work. In recent years, there has been a growing awareness about the need to improve laws governing the ownership of intellectual property. Inadequate intellectual property rights can have widespread ramifications for our standard of living and national exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Increasingly, Australian creative and research efforts are becoming an important part of our national exports and if given adequate protection will play a vital role in the level of exports in the future. Literature such as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Power of One</EMPHASIS> by Bryce Courtenay; films such as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Piano</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Babe</EMPHASIS>; music by Tina Arena, INXS and Dame Joan Sutherland; highly technical and lifesaving research currently being achieved by Positron Emission Tomography at the Austin and Repatriation Medical Centre; the bionic ear; and indigenous artworks and distinctive designer clothing by Jenny Kee and Ken Done are just a few of the examples we have successfully developed in Australia and exported to the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, without sound intellectual property rights there is no incentive for our artists, inventors and scientists to continue to create, and no incentive for investors to back their projects financially. Australia is already a net importer of intellectual property. The Australian Copyright Council estimates that in 1985&hyphen; <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5934">86 exports of copyright based items totalled $220 million, while imports totalled $1,285 million. This $1 billion imbalance reflects the substantial premiums Australian industries pay for the use of copyright material, trademarks and inventions protected by intellectual property rights. These 10&hyphen;year&hyphen;old figures are the latest available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The true imbalance today would be even greater. The greater tragedy of this, however, is that many of these royalties are paid to overseas holders of Australian registered patents. We are basically importing our own inventions because there is not the incentive or the savings base for these goods to be manufactured and developed in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The laws governing intellectual property rights should provide the incentive for private individuals and organisations to invest in research and development. New products and processes are part of the competitive market to help keep firms one step ahead of their opposition and provide the prospect of healthier returns. But firms are not going to invest their time and money in a product that is not protected from duplication, counterfeiting, piracy or plagiarism, either in Australia or on the world market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Piracy is a major problem for the film, video, music, book publishing and computer software industries in Australia and is causing a number of export related problems. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade backgrounder stated in May 1990:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The risk of piracy in the computer software industry was cited as a major factor inhibiting export growth, especially in the micro computer sector.</PARA>
<PARA>A wide range of industries&mdash;including agricultural and veterinary chemicals, pharmaceuticals, automotive parts, apparel and others&mdash;also reported that they were being affected adversely by counterfeiting in overseas markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the recognition of financial rights is only one aspect of copyright. The other is moral rights, which is the right of the author, artist or scientist to prevent any distortion or mutilation which affects the integrity of their work. These rights are not recognised under Australian law. The Australian Copyright Act 1968 is primarily concerned with protecting <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> economic interests. Examples of infringement of moral rights may include, for example, a sculpture being altered so that it fits a selected site, exhibiting a three&hyphen;piece work of art separately or changing the title of published works.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moral rights are recognised in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Everyone has the right to the protection of the moral and material interests resulting from any scientific, literary or artistic production of which he is the author.</PARA>
<PARA>This principle is also included in the 1886 Berne Convention to which Australia is a signatory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In June 1994, the Commonwealth Attorney&hyphen;General's Department issued a discussion paper entitled `Proposed moral rights legislation for copyright creators' which examined the need for specific legislative protection for moral rights. However, the previous government simply sat on the submissions for two years and did nothing. It failed to implement modern workable copyright laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It must be recognised that our current copyright laws, drafted 27 years ago, are fast becoming obsolete due to modern technology. I welcome the coalition's commitment to overhaul our copyright laws and to protect both the economic and moral rights of our artists, authors and scientists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Designs also need to be better protected not only to compensate designers for their creation but to encourage designers to be even more creative. Australian designs are covered by the Designs Act 1906 and are protected for a maximum of 16 years from the filing of the application. The question is whether this act, established 90 years ago, adequately protects designers of today. I do not believe it does.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1961, there were just under 1,500 applications for registered designs in Australia. Thirty years later, in 1991, this figure had risen to just over 3,900 applications&mdash;hardly a reflection of the huge technological, engineering and industrial advances we had made over the same period. I believe one of the main reasons for this lack of confidence by manufacturers in the registered design system is the widespread failure of the act to protect design proprietors. Less than 10 per cent of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5935"> alleged design infringement cases are successful&mdash;hardly an incentive for manufacturers to seek design protection and points to a major flaw in the registered design system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is little incentive for manufacturers to design new products, if a competitor can copy the design with just subtle changes, market the product and reap the resulting profits without paying a cent to the original designer. Our designers and manufacturers have been badly let down. The act needs to cover not only designs for new or original products but also designs which are slightly changed or improve the product.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the global village becomes a reality, I believe there is a need for a world patent. This would mean that, once a patent application was successful in Australia, it would be automatically recognised by all other countries. This does not exist now, but there are already enough international intellectual property agreements in place to suggest the feasibility of a world patent. For example, under the community patent treaty a single application filed at the European Patent Office will, if successful, lead to automatic patent recognition in every country in the European Community. A worldwide patent would reduce the huge cost burden the current world patenting process places on Australian businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is currently a party to 14 international conventions affecting international property rights, including the trade related aspects of intellectual property rights agreement. The TRIPS agreement requires World Trade Organisation members to provide a base level of protection to various forms of intellectual property and a minimum level of enforcement of these rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> In today's society, we can literally access the world at a touch of a button, which is why it is so important that we adequately protect our intellectual property. The first step towards achieving this is to undertake these long overdue reforms. What our industry, our scientists and our creators really need is a complete overhaul of the laws governing ownership of intellectual property to ensure that Australia reaps the rewards of the ideas, inventions, designs and research which origi nate here. Now is the time for this review. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to put forward some thoughts on the current debate occurring in Australia regarding migration and the way that has been misused and abused in some quarters in what would be quite a racist manner. I note the presence of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), who I am proud to call a friend, even if he would not call me that&mdash;I am sure he might. I hope he will find nothing of great complaint regarding what I have to say tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would link up the question of racism and the debate on Asian migration with the term `multiculturalism'. One of the problems I see with the current debate is with the definition of the terms; that is, people are using some of these words as it suits them in their own circumstances as they see it, often not only in a situation where they do not understand the meaning of the word or what the word was meant to mean or what some people think the word was meant to mean but also in a situation which is largely based on ignorance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is one of the real concerns in this debate&mdash;that so much of it does appear to be on the basis of ignorance. I do not blame anyone in particular for that. I would not say it is just a matter of it being an individual member of this parliament. I think it comes across clearly in talkback radio, in letters columns in the various papers and also in calls that I have got at my electorate office. That ignorance is also based on an element of fear&mdash;fear and concern about the future of this country, fear and concern about the future of our children, fear and concern about what in fact is Asia, fear and concern about what in fact is our place in the modern world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5936"> I have been doing a bit of reading today to try to catch up on some of the current debate on this issue. I was concerned that there was some difficulty in accessing documentation which really laid it all out in regard to this issue. That is part of the public debate that is missing. When comments are made by indi viduals stating facts as they see them, which are in fact not facts at all, if they are not refuted they become a truth and that truth grows and grows and grows. I think so much of what we have seen in recent times is along those lines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to relate some personal experiences as a member for an electorate with a high level of residents of a non-English speaking background, as a former councillor for the old city of Springvale in the south&hyphen;eastern suburbs of Melbourne, and also as a resident for some six years in the suburb of Noble Park in that city of Springvale. Springvale has sometimes been called `Chingvale' by those who probably have never been there, because of a high level of Asian migrants who have made the area their home. It is a very unfortunate and unfair term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As one who has doorknocked the streets of Springvale in order to convince the good burghers of that area to put their trust in me&mdash;they have on occasions done so; why I will never know&mdash;the situation is that there are many other migrants in that area, not just Asians. In fact, if you pick a country in the world, the chances are there would be people from that country living in the Springvale area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When walking around Springvale or going to the Springvale shops, the comment was often made, `There are thousands of Vietnamese people who live here.' As a councillor I had a bit of experience with the Springvale shopping centre. The fact is that that shopping centre is about the best area in all of metropolitan Melbourne to shop for Asian food, Asian cuisine. The council once did a survey of people who were using the shopping centre and found that it was used by people from as far away as Werribee and Lalor&mdash;people from the other side of town. The reason for that location being heavily Asianised, if you like, was the fact that there was good, cheap food available. That shopping centre was a major source of economic development for that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I first moved into Noble Park an elderly family of Anglo-Saxon extraction lived in the house on my left. They were very nice people. I bear them no ill. They were <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reasonable neighbours; I have no complaint about that. They moved out after several years and were replaced for the last two or three years of our presence in that street with three generations of a Vietnamese family&mdash;grandparents, mum and dad, and a couple of kids. With no disrespect to my other neighbours, I can honestly say that they were the best neighbours I ever had. They were courteous, polite and quiet. The grandfather even used to come to our place and work in our garden free of charge, because he believed our garden was a bit messy for the area. I think he was right and I make no apology, because I am no gardener. They were good and, I think in many respects, typical.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At that time my kids went to a local primary school called Heather Hill Primary School. If you heard an audio recording of my eldest daughter's class when she was in grade 1, you would think that there were about 30 screaming six&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds running around, jumping, playing and doing what kids that age do. If you saw a video of that class you would think that what was taking place was a junior version of the United Nations. There were people of all different backgrounds, but they were generally recently arrived migrants or first generation Australians, and the fact is that they were becoming part of Australian society. Frankly, what we see with Asian migration in general terms is a development of what has occurred with previous patterns of migration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Back in the 1960s when I was a kid, I remember going to my grandparents' place in Brunswick and dealing with Greek, Italian and Turkish kids who had come there to make it their home. They are now doing things like playing for Aussie rules football teams, working as accountants or lawyers, and they are part of our society. Essentially, that is what is happening too with Asian migrants today. The fact is that they look a bit more different, therefore they are a bit more noticeable, therefore they are a bit easier to use as an excuse, and that is what is happening in some respects.</PARA>

They were just local kids causing a bit of trouble; essentially, that was the nature of the area.</PARA>

<ELECTORATE> (Eden&hyphen;Monaro)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(8.31 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, unfortunately, continue to grieve over the wellbeing of those communities in the south&hyphen;east of my electorate which have relied heavily on the hardwood timber industry for many generations. I do not need to remind this House of the extent of the impact that previous federal and state government decisions have had on towns like Eden and Bombala&mdash;decisions that were based on pure politics, not on science, decisions designed to win so&hyphen;called green votes in large urban electorates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know what the people of rural and regional Australia thought of the Labor Party over such disgraceful decisions which threatened to decimate their economies and throw people out of work who had worked hard, honestly and responsibly in the timber industry for many, many years. Yes, they got rid of virtually every single Labor member who represented those areas. That is what they thought of those decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We promised to take the politics out of the timber industry decisions, put the emotions to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5938"> one side, bring the science back in and give some consideration to those rural communities at long last. We started that process when we brought in new regulations covering the export of woodchips. That was sensible, logical and scientifically based. Contrary to the misinformation put out by so&hyphen;called conservation groups, the decision was also good for the environment. It will stop the burning of waste, it will clear the forest floor of rubbish, thus allowing new trees to grow more vigorously, and it will allow foresters to get back to good forest management, with thinning being done, also promoting strong forestry growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decision will also allow some degraded forests to be cleared so that new native hardwood plantations can be established. We all recognise that hardwood plantations are the key to the long&hyphen;term future of the industry, but there has been a disincentive to establish them to date. Unfortunately, there still is a problem in this regard in New South Wales due to the draconian, totally over the top regulation called SEPP46. This regulation is a good old Labor Party method of using socialist regulation as a way of changing attitudes. It does not work and only catches all sorts of other things in the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Meanwhile, the reaction from overseas clients to our government's change in the export woodchip regulations has been very good, particularly the aspect that allows companies to negotiate longer term contracts. In Australia, we too often forget just how young we are. Other countries want to do deals for the long term. They are used to that. We cannot be a world force if we only let our exporters sign up contracts for short periods. So foreign clients were very pleased that they would now be dealing with a country whose government is encouraging longer term contracts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, the new regulations came too late to help a company in my electorate, Harris Daishowa, to negotiate additional contracts for this year. Their clients went elsewhere only weeks before we were able to make the changes. But it does help them for the future and their clients are pleased to be now negotiating along those lines. That is, if <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the New South Wales Labor government allows them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One might ask: what have the New South Wales Labor government got to do with woodchip exports? Nothing legally, but they do control the resource, and they are not playing the fair scientific game in this process. It is about what you would expect, others might say.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth, in good faith, has participated in the process that is designed to achieve a regional forest agreement for the south&hyphen;east. That process is partially completed. There is still an enormous amount of scientific work to be done on the forest and national park areas. It would be premature and scientifically irresponsible to make decisions at this stage as to what should be locked away forever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what has the New South Wales Labor government done? It has pre&hyphen;empted all of the scientific work and announced that 90,000 hectares will go to national park and another 30,000 hectares will be further assessed. When this announcement was made I had the temerity to suggest that `further assessment' was Labor Party code for, `It's okay, extreme green groups, we're really going to lock it away, so just let us play the politics a little bit longer.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My cynicism was proved right the very next day, when the Labor Minister for the Environment, Pam Allan, referred to the 120,000 hectares going to national park. She had it locked away already without any further assessment. To support that, I was subsequently reliably informed that some key high conservation areas were deliberately put into the 30,000 hectares rather than the 90,000 hectares to ensure that it all would be included in national park.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The end result of all of this will be further decimation of the industry and subsequently the communities that rely upon it. But I am very pleased to see that our Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) is awake to these tactics. In a press release last Friday he reminded the New South Wales Labor government of its responsibilities and of the process it should be following. He reiterated that the application of forest reserve <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5939"> criteria must be flexible and must take account of the social and economic importance of the forest industries and the effect on communities. He expressed his great disappointment that the New South Wales Labor government continued to pre-empt the comprehensive regional assessment which must be concluded for the Eden region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the New South Wales Labor government do not return to the proper processes and allow the full scientific research to be done prior to final decisions, the communities of Eden and Bombala and many other smaller communities will be facing a very bleak future&mdash;and this is because the New South Wales Labor government will not be able to keep their commitments on resource supply if they proceed with the magnitude of forest lock-up that they are currently proposing. It will mean that they will not be able to supply the 26,000 cubic metres of milling grade timber needed to sustain a viable industry. They will not be able to supply the necessary pulpwood resource to Harris Daishowa, which would mean a supply of at least 25 per cent below the contract levels that the state government are contracted to supply through to the end of the year 2009.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I warn the New South Wales Labor government that if they pursue a course which results in a breach of contract, a breach that may then lead to a point where the aggrieved company seeks damages, the New South Wales Labor government should not look toward the funds available through the forestry industry structural adjustment package, FISAP, to pay those damages. That would be an absolute abuse of the use of those funds. I will be seeking assurances from the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy that he would not allow Commonwealth money, which comprises 50 per cent of the FISAP funds, to be used in this way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am justifiably concerned as to just where the New South Wales Labor government are going on regional forest agreements. One has to wonder if they really want to see the continuation of a viable, sustainable hardwood timber industry. I also wonder where they stand on value adding in this industry. Just today I received a phone call from someone <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in the Eden area who was made redundant from the timber industry nine months ago. He has invested in a mobile mill that can be taken into the forest and be used in such a way that a lot of waste timber could be processed through it. Many logs that have fallen naturally are lying rotting on the forest floors. They could be processed. These are logs that are uneconomical to take to sawmills and at best may be taken to the chipper.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of the trees that are currently only suitable as pulpwood could be part processed by this mobile mill with the balance going to the chipper. I would have thought this makes a lot of sense&mdash;it creates work and utilises poor quality logs and waste. But the New South Wales Labor government seem to think otherwise and continue to refuse a licence to this enterprising man to scavenge this sort of timber from the forest areas. I will be calling on them to reassess this and look realistically at what is actually happening in these communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The regional forest agreements can work for everyone. They should be based on science, and not on politics. I call on the New South Wales Labor government to rescind their decision to lock up 120,000 hectares of forests and allow the correct processes to be completed before final decisions are taken. Those decisions must be taken with an assessment of the impact on the communities on top of the priority list, not down the bottom, where they currently are.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity tonight to make very clear the position of the opposition on public housing and, in particular, the areas where we are at variance with the government. The Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) has constantly implied that she has bipartisan support from the opposition for the government's proposed reforms to public housing. I would like to put it on the record in this parliament, as I did in a letter to the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>  last week, that the Labor Party rejects this claim. There are areas of housing policy where Labor does have a degree of commonality with the government, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5940"> but there are significant and crucial differences.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my letter to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> I made the point that Senator Newman's recent pronouncements on public housing reform in that newspaper had been long on rhetoric of a rosy future for all renters, both public and private, but very short on the critical detail. What we do know is that this Liberal government has reduced the current Commonwealth-state housing agreement from three years to one, thus ruling out any long-term capital investment in new public housing stock by the states. This has caused the New South Wales government to greatly reduce its planned construction of public housing units from around 3,500 per year to just 680 this year. No doubt it is the same in all the other states. This will also mean the loss of more than 4,000 jobs in the building and construction industry in New South Wales alone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Less quantifiable, but possibly even more long term, has been the damage caused by the general uncertainty resulting from the restriction of the CSHA to one year and the failure to clearly define and act upon whatever it is that is to replace the Commonwealth-state housing agreement. In my own electorate of Jagajaga, tenants in public housing and public housing workers are becoming increasingly frustrated by the uncertainty and delays to necessary work that this government's half-baked attempts at housing reform have produced. One direct outcome that I know has disadvantaged the public housing residents of West Heidelberg has been the cutting of funds from minor capital upgrades. This has meant that there can be no work carried out to modify housing for tenants with disabilities or for tenants whose increasing age or frailty necessitates modifications to bathrooms and toilets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Of equal concern is the fact that, where housing has become so run down that replacement rather than repair is the recommendation, there are no funds available and so the unit is usually sold. Thus this government's policy is leading to a net reduction of public housing stock. Government workers in public housing are becoming increasingly frustrated as they try to find answers to tenants' ques tions about their likely future. This uncertainty is breeding suspicion and distrust&mdash;all because the government still has not provided the community with any detail about its reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I turn to another state and look at the Brisbane <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS> of last Friday which carried a report about this issue. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS> referred to the Queensland Minister for Public Works and Housing, Ray Connor, being heckled and called a `galah' by angry public housing tenants at a Brisbane forum called to consider the implications of the `controversial federal government housing reforms'. The newspaper reported:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Public housing tenants told the forum, organised by Queensland Shelter, that they were "scared" about the rental subsidy scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">They predicted the reforms would result in evictions, poverty and longer waiting lists.</PARA>
<PARA>Speakers at the hearing then went on to detail one of Labor's main concerns with the proposed changes. I quote again from the newspaper report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the rental subsidy scheme would make the poor poorer and put money straight into the pockets of private developers.</PARA>
<PARA>The newspaper reports that at the meeting:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Connor predicted the Federal Government's final resolution on the housing reform statement&mdash;scheduled for January&mdash;would not be achieved for "quite some time".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">He used the forum to reiterate his growing concerns about the housing blueprint.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"I'm becoming decidedly reluctant about the proposed changes, because so far there has been no assurances Queenslanders won't be financially disadvantaged," he said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"It has to be signed by me and I will not sign it."</PARA>
<PARA>It is therefore apparent that the government has failed to convince even one of its more conservative state governments of the benefits of its proposed changes to public housing. It seems likely they will be forced to roll over another Commonwealth-state housing agreement into another year of uncertainty, confusion and unnecessary worry for tenants. That the government has failed to carry the states along with its ideas is not surprising. The states can see that the policies the Commonwealth is proposing will leave them&mdash;the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5941"> states&mdash;with increased responsibilities and less resources to meet these responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> It is important to make the point that Labor is not opposed to reform of public housing. Indeed, changes and reforms were already happening under the previous Labor government. It is simply the case that we feel the Howard government looks like they will throw the baby out with the bathwater. In their rush to implement policies in accordance with their ideological agenda, they place undue confidence in the ability of the marketplace to achieve outcomes that the opposition feels should remain the responsibility of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> This is best seen in this government's desire to move from a system involving a balance between the provision of public housing units by governments and the provision of a level of rent assistance to low income renters in the private rental market to one where the federal government no longer requires any commitment by the states on the provision of public housing stock.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many arguments are advanced by the government to support this policy change. The opposition accepts some of these, such as the desire to see public housing tenants located as closely as possible to services and employment opportunities. However, the notion that housing for low income Australians can be entirely left to the mercies of the private rental market is one that we emphatically reject.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just want to outline some of the things that Labor believes any bipartisan approach to public housing must contain. First, overall levels of public housing stock should be maintained. We would not agree to any reduction in the Commonwealth-state housing agreement of overall levels of public housing. Secondly, there should be an increase in public housing in areas of need. It is not the case that all parts of Australia have adequate access to public housing. In fact, to go back to the Queensland example once again, we have serious evidence of considerable underprovision of public housing in that state. The Commonwealth-state housing agreement needs to recognise this fact and provide the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> capital to the Queensland government to ensure that public housing is built.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, public housing in well&hyphen;located areas, especially the inner parts of cities and those close to jobs and services, should be maintained. This government has yet to say categorically that it will not stand for the states selling off well&hyphen;located stock. Fourthly, the redevelopment of old public housing estates is another very important part of any new agreement. Fifthly, there should be a guarantee that no public housing tenant will pay more than 25 per cent of their income in rent and that no existing tenant be disadvantaged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sixthly, the new CSHA should contain national tenancy legislation and, finally, all public housing should be maintained at acceptable community standards. This requires a clear role for capital within the new Commonwealth-state housing agreement so that we do not see older public housing estates just deteriorate and left to be pulled down at some future date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Location of public housing is a key concern of Labor's housing policy. It was the primary motivation behind the increase in funding for private rent assistance as a partial means of breaking the deadly nexus between poorly located public housing and employment opportunities. But it was never ever intended as a replacement or substitute for public housing. Until the government shows its agreement and commitment to these public housing priorities that I have outlined, we will not be able to have a bipartisan approach. I hope that change will happen very shortly.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In light of the historic circumstances of today's debate, I wish to use my grievance debate this evening to make some comments about the issue of euthanasia. I preface my remarks by saying that I have practised medicine for 13 years. I chaired the ethics committee of the Australian Medical Association for three years and in that role, apart from other things, was involved in the investigation into the improper behaviour of some medical practitioners.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just interrupt the member briefly. I am sure he is aware of standing order 71 which will allow him in a grievance debate to traverse this area so long as he makes no reference to the legislation before the House and the specifics of that legislation, particularly as it refers to the Northern Territory act.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RW5">Dr NELSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, thank you, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, I am aware of that. When speaking at a conference three years ago, an elderly man from the back of the audience interjected, `This is all very well, but what are you doing about euthanasia? The old people of Australia don't know how they are going to survive without it.' That comment reflects some of the uncertainty that exists in the community in relation to terminology.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Equally, on 28 April last year I was at a function on the Gold Coast for the Royal Australasian College of Physicians when the then Governor-General, Mr Bill Hayden, a proponent of euthanasia, said that, having lived a good life&mdash;and I do not doubt that from what I read in the newspapers at the time&mdash;and visited many nursing homes, he would not like to be like that when he got to the age of many nursing home residents. He felt that he had a right as an individual and as a human being to request the timing and the manner of his own death.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I was recently told by one of my political colleagues that I should be aware of the polls and that I should not be left behind, because 70 to 80 per cent of people responding to polls were in favour of euthanasia. There are a number of points that need to be made in relation to polls. The first is that the reality of the polls is that people are just walking down a supermarket aisle on Saturday morning with <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> two or three children looking for cornflakes when somebody says, `I am from Newspoll. Do you think the law ought to be changed to allow a doctor to give a lethal injection to a person that is suffering from a terminal illness?' Like some other surveys, I say, `What is wrong with the other 20 per cent who don't reply yes?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What most Australians&mdash;in fact, I think all of us&mdash;fear is not death so much as the process by which we will arrive at our death. We fear dying an unnecessarily painful and undignified death. For those who understandably are not frequently having to think about the issues in relation to dying, it is an easier thing to answer yes to such a question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The second point that ought to be made is that just because something is popular does not always make it right. For example, at the moment it would seem that some of the comments attributed to the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) are popular, but I would suggest to the House and to the community that they are not necessarily right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue is like dusk. Those people who are in favour of euthanasia and those who are against it are neither fully right nor wrong. It is very difficult to tell whether it is day or night. But not all things in life can or should be regulated by laws. There are some who say that this matter should be out in the open and not behind closed doors, as they perceive it to be. But the law is a blunt instrument. It does not have the finesse to deal with all of those circumstances in which we inevitably find ourselves as human beings, whether it be as doctors, nurses, patients or families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The law is about winners and losers. It not about dignity. It does not deal with the issues of fear, uncertainty, respect and expectation at all well. In my experience, the concepts of trust and respect are much more likely to flourish in a relationship which is governed by ethics, morality and common sense than it is by the laws which govern the day-to-day transactions of life. When we put the law in a situation where it has to be involved in some of the most difficult and intimate decisions that people have to make, then the doctor and the patient find themselves as potential adversaries. From experience, I have <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5943"> found that that is not in the interests of a patient.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> People request euthanasia usually when they are diagnosed as having a disease from which they will not recover. Understandably, they are depressed. Many people who are dying feel guilty about the grief they see their loved ones going through. For example, Mr Dent from the Northern Territory was concerned that his wife had to provide certain levels of personal care to him. Equally, relatives feel that they are unable to cope with the process themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former Chief Minister of the Northern Territory was reported at one stage as saying, in favour of euthanasia legislation, that he had watched his mother die and that no-one should have to go through that. It begs the question: for whom is such legislation intended&mdash;those who are dying or those who, for whatever reason, have difficulty coping with the process?</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RW5">Dr NELSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will get back onto thick ice, Mr Deputy Speaker. The other experience I have had is that people particularly request euthanasia because they are in pain. But, in fact, it is usually because they are not being treated properly. They are being treated by doctors and medical people who do not have access to good palliative care and who are not up to date. Frequently, I have also found that doctors fail much more as human beings than they do as scientists.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not all pain and suffering is of a physical nature. Unfortunately, many doctors fail in the interpersonal relationships which they have&mdash;or perhaps do not have&mdash;with their patients and the families. I think that people also need to be reminded of this fact. I certainly have met people who were told three years ago that they only had three months to live and they were told that by five or six doctors who are proficient experts in a particular field.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> When Mr Hayden said that he had an individual right to request euthanasia&mdash;in his own words `to no longer be a burden to his own family and to society'&mdash;it is very appeal ing to all of us to say, `Yes, that appeals to me. I want that right. Nobody is going to tell me what to do.' But when one human being exercising their rights diminishes those of others then I think we have a responsibility to say, `No, we don't think this ought to happen.' If Mr Hayden and someone in bed 10 says, `I no longer wish to be a burden to my family and to society,' and has euthanasia, then that places others around them in a position where they feel guilty about continuing to live.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Economic Advisory Council, in its report of January last year into the cost of ageing, actually canvassed euthanasia as a prospective solution to this problem. Professor Peter Singer from Victoria said that babies up to 30 days of age could have their lives ended. One has to wonder where legislation to give effect to such things might end up. Equally, it is of concern that as a society, in a nation which has a youth suicide rate that is amongst the highest in the industrialised world, we are sending a message to young people who similarly suffer despair that we think death is a legitimate solution to what are thought of as insurmountable problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have also found over the years, in caring for people who have later died, that it is quite possible for people and their families, when they face the battle of death, to emerge from the whole process having had what you might call a spiritual victory. I suggest to those who, understandably, are concerned with quality of life that life is a struggle&mdash;no more so than when you are dying&mdash;but the value of life lies in how you deal with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a crisis in this country, there is a crisis in society, and it is deeply rooted in the higher moral priority given to people's rights than their responsibilities, and on value rather than values. There is a preoccupation with the here and now, a preoccupation with `me' and `What am I going to get out of life?' on `What is going to happen to me?' rather than concern for other human beings.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the mid&hyphen;1980s I was the Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure. It does not exist now; its job was taken over by the Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration. The expenditure committee mirrored a lot of the work that the Joint Committee of Public Accounts did in those days.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of its inquiries, when I was chair, was into the activities of the Aboriginal Development Commission, the predecessor of the current Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. That inquiry took between 18 months and two years. In that time, the committee travelled widely around Australia, looking at Aboriginal communities, talking to Aboriginal groups, talking to many people who were critical of the ADC, and generally trying to find some answer to what in those days were some of the ongoing problems in that Commonwealth government instrumentality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All members of that committee&mdash;or all except one, I think&mdash;tended to change most of their views towards the end of that inquiry. When we went out to regional Australia and saw the circumstances in which Aboriginal people lived&mdash;the difficulties people had in getting things like education and clean water for their children, getting housing over their heads and getting medical attention&mdash;it became evident that the Aboriginal people had not been served well by the European community that came here just over 200 years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It struck me at that time that government had to find some other way of resolving our position with the Aboriginal people or else, it seemed to me, it would be difficult for us, as Australians, to look ourselves in the eyes. If we are not able to say that we have made a form of peace with the people who were in this country before us, it says something bad about us as a community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> From time to time over the years in Australia, the issue of race bubbles up, then fortu nately goes away. Then, in uncertain times, it tends to come back again. Unfortunately, at present we are seeing a resurgence of criticism&mdash;uninformed criticism&mdash;by people about how we should deal in our relations with the Aboriginal community. One of the things that brought me to the view of the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating&mdash;that reconciliation and land rights were an answer to this question&mdash;was that we have failed in everything else. With the great affinity that Aboriginal people have with the land, that might be the way for us European Australians to come to some reconciliation with the people who cared for this land for 40,000&hyphen;odd years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems that, when we get into a position of nearly agreeing on these things, we find ourselves unable to do it. But there is one thing we all should be able to agree on, and that is that what happened with Aboriginal children in Australia up to 1969 was pretty awful. Entire communities of people of indigenous background have been scarred deeply by this country's past draconian policy of assimilation. The separation of thousands of children from their families for no other reason than that they were Aboriginal has left a scar on the people involved and a scar on Australia as a nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Evidence has been given to the national inquiry into the separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children from their families. It is estimated that in New South Wales one in three Aboriginals now over the age of 25 were removed from their families as children. Nationally, the figure is one in four. These people are still suffering and many of the social issues affecting indigenous Australians today result from their having been treated differently and insensitively in the past. Historian Professor Peter Read estimates that, nationally, 100,000 Aboriginal children were removed from their families under the laws which existed until 1969. Only 30 years ago we were taking Aboriginal children away from their families for no reason other than that they were Aboriginal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Generations of people had their family life destroyed. Aboriginal children were taken away not because they were neglected by their parents or because their removal offered <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5945"> them some hope of a better life but just because they were Aboriginal. Today many of the widespread problems in Aboriginal communities stem from this policy. Family breakup, violence, chronic ill&hyphen;health, alcoholism, substance abuse and lack of parenting skills stem often from the grief, loss and unresolved trauma of many of these people who were taken away from their parents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today there is a crisis of parenting in the Aboriginal community as the majority of these children did not receive adequate consistent parenting themselves, especially during the earlier and most formative years of their life. Apart from the thousands of children who were directly affected at the time, there was a more serious effect on the capacity of the removed children to become parents themselves. Removal of the children, therefore, had become a generation cycle. There is a strong link between institutionalisation of parents when they were young and criminalisation of their children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem, as numerous submissions to the inquiry have noted, is that children when institutionalised do not learn parenting skills themselves. The consequences of these policies are flowing on. In Queensland and Western Australia, the inquiry found that in the juvenile justice institutions almost all the kids involved were the children of the stolen generation. In the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, 43 of the 99 deaths investigated were of people who had been taken away from their families as children. That shows the pain that these people still suffer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is sad that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) seems to have no understanding of the pain and suffering caused by the forced separation of Aboriginal children from their parents. This shows through in a letter that he wrote to the Northern Territory's Chief Minister, Mr Shane Stone, where he expressed reservations about the benefits of a national inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, irrespective of which party it is, has an obligation to come to grips with these problems of the past. We all have a responsibility to Australia to acquit the past actions on behalf of our predecessors. Part of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that acquittal involves allocating resources to heal the damage caused by the removal laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember the previous shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs, the member for Hindmarsh (Ms Gallus), sending out a press release saying Aboriginal groups had approached her office saying that in the 1990s Aboriginal women who have their children placed by welfare agencies lack support to rebuild their lives and regain their children. As a result, the situation does not improve with the burden and grief of losing their children and their lifestyle becomes worse. She went on to say that an inquiry was urgently needed to assist both the Aboriginal people who were suffering from the pre&hyphen;1970s policies and those who were still losing their children because of the poverty and breakdown of Aboriginal families. The government, unfortunately, showed a lot of concern while in opposition but do not seem to now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many experiences that people have had that show that it was a horrible past for many people. But Senator Herron says a lot of the people benefited. `Benefit' is a pretty subjective thing. I do not see how anyone can think that any parent could benefit from losing their child. How would any honourable member feel if someone came along and took their kids away from them just because they were part of that reviled group called politicians and said, `You are unfit to parent your children,' and took them away?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If someone took one of my three boys away from me when they were young, it would have killed them and killed me. But the government goes on and says that they do not see the need for this inquiry. I hope that, when the government considers the motion the Prime Minister will hopefully agree on with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) shortly on the issue of race, we will confront this issue because we are all successors of the past&mdash;and unless we understand what happened then we will be forced to relive it again.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My grievance tonight is with the New South Wales Labor government and its interim forest <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5946"> assessment process announced last month. On 23 September&mdash;after many anxious months for those involved in the forestry debate in New South Wales&mdash;the Carr government announced what it described as `historic reforms which will create new, better paid and safer jobs in a revitalised NSW timber industry'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The New South Wales Minister for Land and Water Conservation, Kim Yeadon, even claimed the package `gives industry the certainty it needs to invest in the future and to create jobs'. In reality, the package announced has simply added to the uncertainty for many in the state's timber industry and left an even bigger cloud over the future of many communities in regional NSW, in particular on the mid north coast.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was supposed to be an `interim' process only. The Carr government were simply required to identify forests for the national reserve system to be created through regional forest agreements as negotiated under the Commonwealth&hyphen;state agreement. Instead, the Carr government made a number of `concrete' decisions, including locking up an extra 200,000 hectares of forests in national parks and wilderness areas, further reductions in crown sawlog quotas, plus a 30 per cent increase in timber royalties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, the Carr government has pre&hyphen;empted the outcomes of the RFA process in a vain effort to make good its election commitments to the Green movement. Bob Carr's political expediency has served only to damage the New South Wales forest industries yet again and undermine the whole RFA process. As the federal Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) stated in a press release on 3 October:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The result of the NSW Government's actions has been to undermine the scientifically rigorous processes that both the Commonwealth and NSW had agreed would form the basis for signing Regional Forest Agreements.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a bit rich for NSW to claim this is an interim decision pending the completion of further detailed assessments, and then lock in a range of long term outcomes.  <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>The NSW package had a number of key elements including, from 1 July 1997, sawlog supplies to fall a further five per cent to 10 per cent&mdash;after a 30 per cent cut this year&mdash;to between 60 per cent and 65 per cent of 1995&hyphen;96 quota levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The package has committed to five&hyphen;year resource security agreements set at 50 per cent of the 1995&hyphen;96 quota levels. There has been the creation of a 90,000&hyphen;hectare national park in Eden, with logging deferred from a further 30,000 hectares pending completion of an RFA. The New South Wales package adds 45,000 hectares to national parks, 153,000 hectares to wilderness areas and 671,000 hectares are deferred from logging, pending the completion of RFAs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been plans to use Commonwealth&hyphen;state restructuring moneys to purchase private forest land to supplement timber supplies. The price of quota sawlogs is to increase by an average of 20 per cent from 1 January 1997. The plan also proposes to establish regional harvest advisory boards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The impact of this package on the industry in New South Wales will be a reduction in the viability of the timber industry. First, it will reduce the quantity and quality of timber supplies by cutting sawlog quotas again and by restricting logging from more and more forests. Second, it will increase the cost of timber by increasing royalties by 20 per cent next January. Together, these two elements of reduced timber supplies and higher timber costs will see a gradual squeezing of many small and medium sized timber operations, some of which are in my electorate. As one timber industry person put it to me recently, it is death by strangulation for small business in this industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Carr government's decision undermines the RFA process. Locking up an extra 200,000 hectares in national parks and wilderness areas before the more detailed and comprehensive environmental and socioeconomic studies have been completed in the RFA process is unfair. Bob Carr is playing god with the future of New South Wales forests. He has prematurely sealed the fate of yet more vast tracts of forest land. He has ignored the proper scientific and consultative process <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5947"> his government jointly agreed to follow with the Commonwealth in setting up RFAs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Carr government's decision will create further industry uncertainty. There are real concerns as to whether the levels of supply to which New South Wales has committed itself can be achieved, given the additional forest reservations and deferrals that have been made. The New South Wales government has admitted that there will be difficulties in matching its sawlog commitments to the timber industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, it wants to set up regional harvest advisory boards. These boards will be faced with the problem of deciding which deferred forest areas will need to be logged in order to meet commitments. While the proposal appears admirable, the make-up of these regional committees with pro-green and pro&hyphen;logging interests could ensure no decisions are reached. In other words, Bob Carr has become Pontius Pilate and washed his hands of any responsibility on meeting sawlog commitments by handing such decisions to these local boards&mdash;guaranteeing further chaos in the timber industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the New South Wales government wants to purchase private forest land to replace existing state forest log supplies. Not only is this a waste of taxpayers' money, it sends the wrong signals to the timber industry, causing yet more uncertainty and problems. The Carr government's decision also excludes other forest users. Forest users, including other sections of the New South Wales timber industry, beekeepers and graziers, have been excluded from the process so far. They have all been affected by the Carr decision, yet were never consulted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We might ask: what is next? In the wake of last month's announcement, the Commonwealth and New South Wales governments will have to sit down and renegotiate the DFA agreements before proceeding further towards establishing regional forest agreements. While the New South Wales Labor government has sought to play politics with our forests, the Commonwealth remains committed to a balanced future for our forests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This process will include fast&hyphen;tracking the RFA process.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conduct of comprehensive <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> regional assessments leading to negotiation of RFAs is to be accelerated following an additional $48 million in this year's budget. This will ensure finalisation of all RFAs for export woodchip producing areas by mid&hyphen;1998 and all remaining RFAs by mid&hyphen;1999. The RFAs will provide a world&hyphen;class reserve system and the basis for an internationally competitive, value adding and sustainable forest industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth has implemented a new woodchip export licensing regime, which sees the retention of the present woodchip export licence ceiling of 5.25 million tonnes plus an extra one million tonnes from sawmill residues and silvicultural thinnings. The Commonwealth requires a three-year licence, which replaces the annual licence regime, and it has banned woodchip exports from areas not covered by RFAs by the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The wood and paper industry strategy will be implemented. This strategy aims to promote the development of the wood and paper industry by expanding the plantation resource base, accelerating research and development of value added products, increasing international competitiveness, and developing an internationally recognised certification scheme for sustainably produced forest products. The Commonwealth will continue the forest industry structural adjustment package, which aims to ameliorate the impacts on native forest industry business and workers adversely affected by DFA and RFA outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, the Commonwealth has taken a sensible approach to the management of what should be a sustainable industry in Australia&mdash;unlike the New South Wales government,  where speculation remains rife as to the extent of damage and job losses that will arise out of the New South Wales government's interim forest assessment announcement last month. The real impact remains to be seen. The next stage of the comprehensive regional assessment process towards establishing RFAs in New South Wales will hopefully be less political and more transparent than that which has been achieved thus far by the Carr government alone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5948"> Our forests and the people that rely on them&mdash;conservationists and the timber indus try&mdash;deserve better, sounder decision making from government than that which has been provided by the New South Wales Labor government, which evidently in this process and through the decision that has been undertaken are just playing populist politics, particularly with the Green movement. We all saw the election campaign that was run by Labor in the seat of Clarence where the elected member, Mr Harry Woods, was going to be the guardian of the forest industries. I am afraid Harry Woods did not do too much for the forest industry when the Carr Labor government made these decisions, which are going to have a profound and detrimental impact on the forest industries in New South Wales.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The National Heritage Trust of Australia Bill establishes a Natural Heritage Trust reserve, with some of the proceeds of the partial privatisation of Telstra. The fund will be essential for certain environmental projects. It will integrate the joint interests of environmental protection and sustainable development to protect and rehabilitate Australia's natural environment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My electorate of Murray is in the heart of the Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin. Many years ago it was fashionable to look at the environmental problems in that area and to blame individual farmers. Back in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s people used to look at the high watertables, the dead and dying trees and the less than sustainable natural flora and fauna and say that the problem was that farmers were irrigating badly. In the 1980s, the Victorian government took a long hard look at the problem and after an all party inquiry decided to dedicate something like $23 million per annum to address the problems of sustainable development in areas like the Murray electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sustainable development does not come cheaply. Individuals cannot by themselves turn around problems which have as much to do with the geology of ancient parts of Australia as they have to do with the fact that we cleared a lot of trees and irrigated the land without giving much consideration to drainage. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5949">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 1980s we started to understand catchment planning. If a farmer down basin, say in Echuca or Cobram, wants to do something about the high watertable that is killing his apricot or orange trees he has to look at what is happening often many hundreds of kilometres away in the rocky intake areas&mdash;the areas where the water in the first instance intercepts the ground water system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why should a farmer or other public interests start planting trees in the central highlands of Victoria when the benefit will be achieved down basin many hundreds of kilometres away? I am trying to illustrate that cross&hyphen;basin management requires an integrated effort. It requires public stakeholders&mdash;such as recreational users, the people who live in towns and those who benefit from the food and fibre grown in those areas&mdash;to stand back and say, `All of us need to raise funds so that we can have proper environmental planning.' In that sense, all must participate in a better and more sustainable future for all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the electorate of Murray many millions of dollars is expended by individuals on whole farm plans, water reuse systems, replanting tree plans, looking after the rocky intake areas, planting trees on the roadside and reafforesting the sides of streams. That work is often done on a voluntary basis. The research effort has to be made. Without the many millions of dollars dedicated by the state government and supplemented, through the Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin Commission, by federal funds we would have gone nowhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to give an example from one part of my electorate which is proof of the work that can be done over many decades leading to a sustainable agricultural system&mdash;that is, Barr Creek. Members who learnt geography in the early 1960s and 1970s will remember the reference to Barr Creek as the single biggest source of salt to the Murray. As recently as last Sunday there was a reference to Barr Creek in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun&hyphen;Herald</EMPHASIS> which continued to suggest that Barr Creek is one of the single biggest sources of salt to the Murray.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point about Barr Creek is that underlying it are high watertables fed from many hundreds of kilometres away. It is a very flat <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> area. At the turn of the century irrigation was introduced in this area. Within a decade or so the high watertables resulted in the land not being as highly productivity as it was with the first irrigation application.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 1930s, men on sustenance pay were sent to dig Barr Creek deeper. The idea was that if there was better drainage in this dairy farming area perhaps the productivity could be improved. The men dug into the creek bed in Barr Creek and quickly intercepted the ground water system, which is more saline than the sea. Barr Creek turned from a stream flowing with basically fresh water into a salt drain&mdash;a drain which intercepted the watertable and resulted in the highly saline ground water heading for the Murray. It was not long before part of Barr Creek was diverted to an evaporative basin&mdash;Lake Tutchewop&mdash;in an attempt to keep the salt flows back from the Murray. Too much fresh water was still entering Barr Creek, however, as run&hyphen;off from farms, so Lake Tutchewop was not an efficient evaporative basin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 1980s, it was evident that the Barr Creek farmers were benefiting from the salt drain flowing through to the Murray. But that was a substantial disadvantage to the Murray River basin and the people downstream. With the support of government, with two full&hyphen;time project officers and with funds to help them put in whole farm plans, reuse water systems and to plant trees on channel banks they set about doing the major works which were of minimum local advantage but of major downstream benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Barr Creek today continues to lead the way in dairy production. There are major dairy exports from that region. The food is processed at the Kraft factory in nearby Leitchville, which has just invested, with its other factory, some $90 million in the area. I use this example to illustrate how a community of some 300 dairy farmers worked hard and invested substantial sums of private capital to improve an area when the largest benefit was downstream. They could not do that alone. They did it with government funds and government support. I am suggesting that the Natural Heritage Trust will supply the level <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5950"> of funds which can translate into on&hyphen;ground works which have a major benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Barr Creek today you will see native trees growing, which has brought back bird life. You will see native reptiles and snakes flourishing. The ecosystems are back to being as diverse as they ever were. I suggest that in my area it is not a case of whether or not we need the National Heritage Trust and its billion dollars to help our environment. It is instead a question of how soon it can happen; the whole issue is how we can manage to survive until those funds start to flow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have too much damage now with our blue&hyphen;green algae blooms, indicators of the results of urban water supplies contaminating our systems. We have too much evidence that we are using our waters beyond the capacity of the Murray River to deliver. There are too many demands on our water supply systems. I am arguing that we should support this bill to the fullest extent. The public of Australia understands that our natural heritage is precious. Without sustainable agriculture and sustainable ecological systems we cannot hold our head up amongst other nations. We cannot continue to be the sustainable food and fibre producers that are important for our economy now and in the future.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">About six per cent of Australian workers directly rely on the environment for their livelihoods. This includes the agriculture, forestry, logging, commercial fishing and mining industries. The figures rise dramatically for those who rely for work indirectly on the environment. The number of people employed indirectly as a result of agriculture alone is estimated to be about 27 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The important agriculture and food processing industries which depend upon the environment for survival produce about one&hyphen;quarter of our export income. Our flourishing tourism industry has our unique environment to thank for the rapid increases in the number of tourists to Australia in recent years. The environment also affects us on a much more personal level through air pollution, poor water quality and rising soil acidity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a unique environment here in Australia which is the envy of almost every other country in the world, yet we really have taken it for granted and let it fall into disrepair. During the past 200 years of European settlement we have cleared an estimated 20 billion trees. Thousands of plant and animal species have become extinct; waterways have become polluted with sewage, nutrients and silt; and our soil has become more infertile through salinity, acidity and loss of ground cover. Weed and vermin problems have escalated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over 50 per cent of Australia's land is now in need of some form of repair. The Land and Water Resources Research and Development Corporation estimates that losses from wind and water erosion, rising salinity, lower soil fertility, the decline of native vegetation and invasion by weeds and water pollution stand at a crippling $1.41 billion a year. These figures can no longer be ignored. Almost 70 per cent of Australian adults are concerned about at least one environmental problem. But being concerned is no longer enough; we must start to take action now or run the serious risk of our unique environment becoming little more than a wasteland. That is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5951"> why the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill is so important. It represents a real commitment by this government to environmental action. Australians recognise and share that commitment, including the residents of McEwen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have more than 50 landcare, land management and environmental conservation groups in my electorate. Many of them have written to me welcoming the government's commitment to the environment. Their response to the initiative has been both positive and supportive. `At last,' they say, `the environment is getting the recognition it deserves. Finally, here is a government which has a clear plan for addressing our complex environmental problems.' For example, the Creightons Creek, Ruffy and Terip Landcare Group in my electorate says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our Landcare group was pleased to learn that the Federal Government will be focussing on remedial and preventative works for land degradation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While research will be needed on some aspects of some land problems, there is enough information and know&hyphen;how available in most areas to tackle problems now. Lack of funds is the major limiting factor.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We look forward to the promised increased support for landcare groups and the refocussing of the National Landcare Program. Would you please keep working on this as we believe that such changes will not happen easily.</PARA>
<PARA>For the past 13 years too many vital environmental dollars have been tied up in administration, bureaucracy and bus tours; and too little on positive action and on&hyphen;ground works. Fortunately, this government recognises that it takes more than mere words and a few cheap headlines to address our environmental problems; it takes the sound strategies and substantial funding which this bill delivers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This view is shared by Ingrid Martin, secretary of the Home Creek/Spring Creek Landcare Group in my electorate, who says that the great dilemma that so many landcare and conservation groups are experiencing across McEwen and around Australia is lack of funds. They have the management plans in place, but in order for their grassroots work to provide widespread and lasting results they desperately need the funding and strategies which the Natural Heritage Trust will deliver.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One group in McEwen which has taken the initiative to develop an effective, long-term strategy is the Upper Goulburn Catchment Group, which encompasses 50,000 hectares from Mount Buller to Mansfield, Alexandra, Molesworth and Yea. The Upper Goulburn catchment project area produces half the certified grass seed grown in Victoria, stone fruits for export to Asia, wine grapes, herbs, farm forestry, prime beef and lamb, fine wool, deer, milk and 75 per cent of fish in the state. It is also the second largest potato growing area in Victoria. The unique landscape of the area and its diverse native animal and bird life also make it popular for ecotourism. Water is the lifeblood of the area. The area contains Lake Eildon, Victoria's most important water storage area and a complex system of waterways.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The group's strategy aims to improve and maintain water quality in the catchment by combating the extensive flash flooding, salinity, erosion and pest, weed and land degradation problems currently being experienced. It aims to achieve these objectives by priority works, which include pasture re-establishment, erosion control, extensive revegetation, creek stabilisation and vermin and weed control. However, to do so, the group needs more than $5 million in funding. It may seem like a lot of money but, if we sit back and do nothing, these problems will simply escalate and all the natural advantage the area holds will be lost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another local group, the Goulburn Broken Catchment and Land Protection Board, has just released its draft catchment strategy. This region comprises 2.4 million hectares of land, which supports a population of 200,000 and major agriculture, food processing, forestry and tourism industries. The processes of land clearing and irrigation have resulted in significant degradation of the catchment's land, water and biodiversity. Salinity is such a major problem in the area that a special dry land salinity management plan has been developed to try to control the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If current practices are not altered, salt affected land will increase from 3,500 hectares to 38,000 hectares in the next 30 to 50 years. Already, more than $500,000 a year is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5952"> lost in agricultural production. As a nation so reliant on our environment for employment and export income, we cannot allow the situation to worsen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Community groups like those I have mentioned in McEwen have already prepared themselves for action. It is now time that we, as their elected representatives, work with them to improve the environment. By establishing the Natural Heritage Trust through this bill, this government is going to provide funds to these groups to undertake on&hyphen;ground works. These groups do not need more awareness raising or studies. They need money and well&hyphen;developed strategies, all of which this bill will provide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any attempts by the opposition, the Democrats and the Greens to frustrate this legislation will lead only to further environmental damage&mdash;more land degradation, greater weed and vermin problems, worsening water quality and increased salinity problems. Is this the legacy that we want to leave our children and grandchildren? I think not. This decline can be stopped right here and now. We have the opportunity with this legislation to provide the level of funding needed to arrest and repair environmental damage. I urge all members to support this bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<ELECTORATE> (Richmond)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(9.41 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill is all about government responsibility, focusing on the long-term environmental future of this country rather than short-term political gain. I congratulate my National Party colleague the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson), who is in the House tonight, along with the Minister for the Environment, Senator Hill, and his predecessor, Senator Rod Kemp, for putting together this legislative package which will bring new meaning to the words `responsible environmental policy'. I am particularly pleased that this bill was introduced by a National Party minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are few people who are more in touch with the environment than our farmers. They are the principal custodians of the land. The vast majority of these people consider themselves active environmentalists, not <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> environmental activists. There is a big difference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On this note, I would like to mention some of the initiatives which the previous coalition government implemented. The Antarctic treaties of 1960 and 1980 were coalition initiatives, as was the Whale Protection Act. We proclaimed the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, the Kakadu and Uluru parks and the Christmas Island National Park. We played a major role in the prevention of sandmining on Fraser Island, as well as many other major achievements. These speak for themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The environment, and the protection of it, should not be the exclusive domain of the Greens, the Democrats or the ALP. What the Australian environment needs is a government which will implement policies which are based on hard&hyphen;core scientific fact, not on short-term gains. One classic case in point is the woodchip issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill looks at the environment as a set of integrated and mutually influential issues. It targets five broad environmental issues: vegetation, rivers, biodiversity, landcare, and the coasts and oceans. None of these areas are more important than the other, but we must recognise that they are all interrelated and interdependent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard&hyphen;Fischer government will inject $700 million through a number of major initiatives, concentrating on the following: the national vegetation initiative, the Murray-Darling 2001 project, the national reserve system, the national land and water resources audit, the coast and clean seas initiative, the endangered species program and the national river care initiative. But the beauty of this trust is that, apart from the unprecedented $700 million going into it, another $300 million will remain in perpetuity for future generations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On this note, I would like to highlight a few of the environmental problems we have on the far north coast of New South Wales. The electorate that I represent encompasses three major water catchment areas&mdash;the Richmond, the Brunswick and the Tweed. These catchments, and many coastal catchments in Australia, have a high incidence of acid sulphate soils. Acid sulphate soils, by definition, means <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5953"> the presence of a mineral in the soil called iron pyrite, which releases sulphuric acid when exposed to oxygen. A very hardworking group in my electorate, the Richmond Tweed Acid Sulphate Soils Local Action Committee, is doing some outstanding work to combat the effects of acid sulphate run&hyphen;off, particularly into the Tweed River.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Past experience highlights the importance of this issue. In 1992, over 2,600 tonnes, it was estimated, of pure sulphuric acid were discharged into the Tweed River. In 1994, over 950,000 tonnes were discharged into the Richmond River. The environmental consequences of such a discharge are enormous, particularly when 60 to 70 per cent of commercial fish species spend part of their life cycle in these estuaries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Don Buckley, a director of Tweed Shire Council, along with Mike Melville, from the University of New South Wales, and Ian White, of the CSIRO, have been advocating and testing water and soil pH and monitoring water tables and acid sulphate run&hyphen;off for the past four years. With the cooperation of local cane farmers, such as Robert Quirk and Robert Hawken, these scientists have found that applying lime to cane field drains can change the pH level from 2.7, which is highly acidic, to 7, which is neutral.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to see a slice of the Natural Heritage Trust spent directly on liming acidic drains. Given that the whole Tweed community benefits from a cleaner, safer and more diverse river, the cost of such work should be borne by the taxpayer, not just the cane farmers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another area that this legislation addresses is farm forestry. Apart from direct environmental benefits, farm forestry can offer a much needed source of additional income for landowners. In Richmond, there is a great potential to use relatively poor country to reap the environmental and economic rewards of revegetation. On this front, I am very pleased to see that over $20 million has been allocated to farm forestry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Farm forestry is definitely the way of the future. While we are importing over $2 billion worth of timber products, adding to our trade deficit, we would be foolish not to develop <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> aspects of this industry. But we also need legislation which will give the security of harvest for those land&hyphen;holders who choose to do it and choose to make that 20&hyphen;year investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another issue which is particularly pertinent to this bill is water quality and river health. Regrettably, a recent EPA report found that the quality of water in the northern New South Wales rivers was not up to scratch. Following this, unfortunately an outbreak of food poisoning sparked the closure of the Tweed River to shellfish collection. This attracted great media attention and seriously impacted on the area's reputation as a prime holiday destination. It also affected and jeopardised the livelihood of many hardworking oyster farmers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have no doubt that the $85 million for the national rivercare initiative, as well as the $100 million for the coast and clean seas initiative, will go a long way to solving the degrading effects of stormwater run&hyphen;off, sewage overloads and sediment build&hyphen;up which are threatening the very life of these rivers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take this chance to congratulate the total catchment management groups in these three valleys for their combined work in addressing these problems. On this subject, I think there is a real need for a major change in attitudes to waste management on the part of the public and on the part of local councils, for it is all too easy to blame river degradation on the farmers who may live in the upper catchment areas or on developers. It is time we started thinking about what we do with our own body waste. The general public must take the lead in the Brunswick, Tweed and Richmond catchments. We must recognise that our own body waste is one of the major sources of river pollution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I would like to mention the efforts of over 45 dunecare, landcare and rivercare groups in the Richmond electorate. The local knowledge of these volunteers is one of the greatest assets we have in attempting to conserve our environment. The Natural Heritage Trust will ensure that these landcare groups will become our front&hyphen;line force in tackling dune degradation, pollution control, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5954"> soil conservation and monitoring natural flora and fauna. All these groups deserve praise, particularly my local group, Fingal Dune Care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another particular interest I have is that the Natural Heritage Trust be used to fund the construction of the Caldera Trail. This perhaps could rival the Milford Track. Members of this House who have climbed Mount Warning, such as the member for Farrer, Tim Fischer, would be familiar with the stunning volcanic rim which surrounds the Richmond electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This area takes in four world heritage parks. In order to fully appreciate this Caldera region, I would like to see a walking trail encompass the whole line, linking up with existing trails and giving bushwalkers the chance to experience the unique biodiversity we have in that special part of Australia. There are a number of complex issues in this, such as track degradation and the construction of access points, but I am sure this trust could play a part in getting the project started, along with the rainforest centre which is being built in Murwillumbah.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another group which deserves praise for its outstanding work is the community based Byron Bay Whale Watch Centre. This is Australia's premier viewing platform for watching whales. It is rather ironic that these magnificent mammals are still a source of income for the local economy, despite the fact that this income is now raised by observing and learning from whales instead of slaughtering them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I would like to bring the House's attention to a very relevant expression: you can't be green if you are in the red. I think this expression sums up this legislation. By creating a trust fund, this government is supplying the means by which we will be able to preserve the best environmental practices to ensure that our natural heritage is preserved for the long term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that governments and individuals, when talking about the environment, need to stretch the definition of `long term' from a few generations to forever. Preserving the environment is about ensuring that our grandchildren can enjoy no less than we have <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> today. If we fail to take into account all the facets of the environment, without a long&hyphen;term view, we will soon find that we are degrading our environment faster than we are attempting to preserve it. It is long&hyphen;term environmental policies that we need, not short&hyphen;term political gains.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe certain sectors of the Green movement are guilty of short&hyphen;sightedness by spending their energies on specific, isolated, populist issues at the expense of critical issues of the 1990s&mdash;clean air, clean water, sustainable forestry and soil conservation. Irrespective of our politics, we all have a responsibility to pass on our environment in a better state than we inherited it. This bill sets in perpetuity these goals. As the final backbench speaker on this important piece of legislation, I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make some concluding remarks. I thank all those who have participated in this debate. I found it very interesting to listen, for example, to the two previous speakers and learn something of their obvious commitment to the real problems of environmental degradation and decay that need such urgent addressing in various individual places around the country. There is no doubt that this opportunity before us now is a historically significant one, a very important one, and one that we ought not miss&mdash;for the sake of this generation and future generations in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Governments, for generations now, have been hearing about the serious deterioration of Australia's natural resources. They have responded bit by bit, a little bit more here, a little bit more there, to the point where in recent years there has been a considerable amount of money and resources dedicated to grappling with the problems of natural resource degradation. But the reality is that we now have to face the fact that is abundantly clear: despite the efforts, the deterioration has continued; it is reaching alarming proportions and even accelerating at alarming proportions in many parts of the country, particularly in some of our most productive agricultural producing areas. That leaves us with the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5955"> simple conclusion that a great deal more needs to be done. Governments have been prepared to go part of the way, but I think the community is now insisting that we go the whole way, and that we really do put in an effective, far reaching, visionary and&mdash;let's face it&mdash;expensive effort in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill provides for just those objectives; that is, it constitutes a massive financial commitment to support the efforts of the community to address the problems we so clearly face. The National Farmers Federation, just for one, obviously acknowledges the extent and the seriousness of the problem, but also the need for very large funding resources. It recognises that the options for finding that degree of funding are very limited and that we have indeed isolated the only obvious and entirely appropriate source of funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The extent of the challenges which need to be addressed are really quite daunting. The visual effects of land and water degradation, salinity and vegetation decline are all too apparent across this country. The statistics which have been presented time and again&mdash;we heard some more of them tonight in some excellent presentations&mdash;reflect the deterioration in almost every aspect of our natural resource base.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Natural Heritage Trust contains five key capital projects, all eligible for very substantial funding under the approach that the government has adopted. For example, there is $163 million for the Murray-Darling 2001 project, $32 million for a comprehensive national land and water resources audit, $80 million for a national reserve system, $100 million for the coasts and clean seas initiative, and $318 million for the national vegetation initiative. That is a total going on for $700 million in expenditure proposals. In addition to the five key capital projects, the Natural Heritage Trust provides the mechanism for a further commitment of over $450 million towards the implementation of other extremely important environmental and sustainable agriculture initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In total, the trust will be the springboard for a commitment of $1.5 billion over the next five years to directly engage the most pressing <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> environmental challenges faced by this nation. At the conclusion of the five-year period an amount of around $300 million will still remain in the trust as a foundation for future programs of worth. I think we all know in our heart of hearts that an ongoing commitment by governments, as well as communities and land managers, land custodians&mdash;farmers perhaps chief amongst them&mdash;will be needed probably indefinitely. So I think it is important that we recognise at the outset that the commitment that will be required is a permanent one. It is a commitment until death us do part, so to speak.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The debate in this House over the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill has been a very interesting one. I believe that in some ways it serves a very useful purpose. It has, if you like, invigorated the national debate and helped build an overwhelming recognition by all members that Australia faces a challenge to its natural resources which simply cannot be overlooked. There are social and economic reasons and, in the end, there are trade and employment implications for the future of our nation that simply cannot be overlooked or ignored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it seems to me that I can really say that there is an opportunity here for the members of this House to engage in being part of what will one day be recalled as a defining moment in Australia's approach to natural resource management. It is the moment when the government, the opposition and the independents have an opportunity to put any political differences aside to provide a valuable legacy for future generations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this regard we as parliamentarians here in this parliament now at this time are in a very privileged position. We are privileged in that we have the opportunity to represent the views of our constituents, the policies of our respective parties and our personal views and beliefs in a forum which charts a positive course for the future of this nation. Here now we have this special opportunity before us; we have the opportunity to put any constraints aside and to make a decision which will benefit Australia's natural heritage and thereby enhance the lives and fortunes of future generations. I am a fifth generation farmer <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5956"> and I do have a real awareness of the importance of protecting and sustaining our natural resources for the benefit of those who come after us. We know so much more know than we knew in days gone by. Experience, bought sometimes at great expense over 200 short years of European style farming in this land, coupled with increased scientific knowledge and increased awareness of the fragile nature of the lands that we produce from so abundantly in this country, combine to give us a much stronger platform for future understanding and use of our natural resources. We need to make sure that we don't waste it, that we don't throw it away, that we now take the opportunity to act on the basis of what we know.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that as parliamentary representatives we should all strive to make a positive difference to the welfare of this nation during our terms of office. This Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill will allow us to make a very real difference. Every day, every week&mdash;as one of the immediate past speakers commented&mdash;that the passage of this and the associated Telstra bill is delayed, our natural resources are declining forever, some unfortunately to an irretrievable level. That is a horrifying truth, but truth it is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now is the time to act; not tomorrow, not next month, not in the next parliament, but now. This nation requires a unified commitment to environmental management. The Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill provides a forum for each elected member to demonstrate their personal willingness to stand up and be counted on an issue that really does matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> One of the privileges in my life has been to have been personally part of the development of the government's environmental and sustainable agricultural policy since its inception. It is also a great privilege to have been able to introduce this bill to the parliament for the full scrutiny of members. It is a privilege now to recommend to this House its unified support for an instrument of legislation which will provide the opportunity for the government as a whole to be able to finally address the serious natural resource challenges that it faces&mdash;challenges that I believe we as com munity representatives have nothing short of an outright moral obligation to embrace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When this bill passes to the Senate, there will undoubtedly be further debate on the merits of addressing the serious environmental challenges of this country. Indeed, I make the observation in my closing remarks that there are individuals and groups in the Senate who espouse environmental principles as their very reason for being. In some ways, this bill will be a public test of their conscience, a test of their true resolve in relation to these matters about which they protest such earnest concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In commending this bill, I call upon each and every representative of both houses to put any political differences aside and support the passage of this long overdue piece of legislation, one which will bring about significant and long lasting benefits for this nation, one which, in its entirety, in terms of the broader implications of its implementation and so forth, in my view, constitutes sound communications policy, sound economic policy and undoubtedly sound environmental policy. On that note, I commend the bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA>I wanted to speak briefly to this amendment because, in many respects, it captures not only our second reading amendment but also the other amendments we have sought to make to this legislation. We support the general objectives outlined in this bill. We made that clear in our speeches during the second reading debate. But we do object very strongly to the linking of these very worthy objectives to the sale of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The clause that we object to in this case has, as one of its objectives, that the main source of money for the reserve will be $1 billion from the partial privatisation of Telstra. I do not need to repeat to this House the very considerable concern that we have on this side about that link. The environment is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sufficiently important to stand on its own merits. There is no other area of government policy that has been held hostage in the way that the environment has to the sale of a public asset. That is why we object to this provision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite clear from the material that has been provided to us not only in the budget papers but also through the Senate estimates committee hearings that the amount of additional funding, when you look at the cuts in the budget of some 13 per cent&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order! Would the member for Fremantle resume her seat for a moment. The level of conversation in the chamber is far too loud. I invite members to either take their seats or leave quietly.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XS4">Dr LAWRENCE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What I was outlining was the fact that this $1 billion from the partial privatisation of Telstra is much diminished when you look at the very considerable reductions that have already taken place in the budget that is before this House and that is being debated in the other place at the moment. There is overall a 13 per cent reduction in existing levels of expenditure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is clearly in breach of the commitments that were given by the government before the election when it was said that the Labor Party's then level of funding would be maintained. There were no quibbles, no qualifications. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) repeated that commitment after the election when he said that our funding would be maintained. Instead, when the budget came down, we found some 13 per cent overall reduction. In some areas of policy there were very substantial cuts in addition to that, ranging up to 21 per cent in the case of the Environment Protection Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The community have been asked to take the government at its word on the use of these funds in the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia reserve. I think at this stage the government's word would have to be seen to be considerably lacking. In addition, if you add together the previous levels of funding by the Labor government and the commitments we made during the election campaign to the funds that the government was committed to, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5959"> minus their budget commitments plus the Telstra amounts, you are talking generously at around $50 million extra a year. That is for the sale of one-third of Telstra, with the very considerable disadvantages that confers throughout the community. It is the loss of a public asset of great magnitude. The government is going to deliver to the environment in excess of what Labor promised to the tune of $50 million a year. Members opposite ask why we object to this legislation. We object to it because it is very clear indeed that this is of no advantage to the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other element of this amendment that I have proposed is that the whole idea that the bill is simply dealing with matters of capital infrastructure is basically designed to hoodwink people. When the government were in opposition they were in the difficult position of saying, `Well, anything that we privatise, anything that we sell off, we will make sure that it only goes to repaying debt or capital expenditure.' So they are put in the position of having to define a lot of these programs that they list in the bill as if they were capital structure when clearly they are recurrent expenditure. That is, they would normally be funded from the recurrent revenues of the nation. We are asked to believe that they have this new quality conferred upon them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was made clear in the deliberations and questions in the Senate estimates committees that a lot more things might be added to the Natural Heritage Trust over time, many of which clearly do not have the character of capital infrastructure. We object on both those points to this clause.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask every member of the House to read Denis McCormack's research paper, which was presented under Victorian police protection to the 20th anniversary conference of the prestigious Asian Studies Association <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of Australia at the Latrobe University, Melbourne, on 10 July 1996. His paper was entitled `The grand plan:  Asianisation of Australia&mdash;race, place and power'. It was incidentally the same day that Mr Ted Drane, the sporting shooter, was firing blanks at Denis and AAFI during his nationally televised Press Club address. The Press Club would learn a lot more from Denis than they did from Ted, which is why the media so fear his research, the obvious influence and political activism of Denis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have said before that Australia needs Denis McCormack in federal parliament. In this paper, which I intend to seek to table tonight, he has arrived. I will now read into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> the abstract of his paper and then seek your good judgment in allowing me to table the paper in the national interest. I hope this documentation will at once enable, inform, empower and inspire you to buck your respective parties and factions, and start representing more accurately in this place what members well know to be the majority of Australian views on immigration and Asianisation. Unless this problem is sorted out soon, the Australia that the majority of Australians have loved is doomed, and other problems become more insoluble. Here is the most concrete of abstracts:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Quoting only mainstream press/academic sources, this paper makes the case that a long&hyphen;range `grand plan' was nurtured by elites for the Asianisation of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Analysis of the process, together with some of its prominent players, has never before been drawn together for chronological exposition. The diggers, the founders of the Labor Movement, the Fathers of Federation, Furphy, Lawson and Patterson, along with countless other true&hyphen;blue Australians, from their day to ours, warned about the future swamping, dispossession and eventual disappearance of all things traditionally Australian should mass Asian immigration ever be sanctioned. Those warnings of yesteryear are today not only officially ignored and suppressed, but are being systematically erased from our common national memory through manipulation of Immigration Policy, Multicultural Policy, Education, Trade, Foreign Affairs, Defence, and Industrial Relations as well as Finance and Economic Management Policy in relation to globalisation, privatisatio</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">n, deregulation, foreign ownership and foreign investment. Australia is being demographically and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5960"> economically recolonised through gradualist bipartisanship against often demonstrated public opinion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although this paper was written in early November `95, before the change to a Liberal/National Coalition Government after the March `96 Federal Election, the author has resisted the temptation to tinker with the text since the incoming Government has made it clear that whilst the faces have changed, the song remains the same. Apart from some useful but minor administrative changes, overall direction in vital policy areas outlined above will remain consistent with the directional changes initiated over the last 30 years&mdash;changes that simply became more obvious under the recent 13 years of Labor Government. Hence the paper's central thesis of the existence of an anti&hyphen;democratic Immigration/Asianisation bipartisan continuum remains intact, even bolstered.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian public is largely uninformed about the scale of the scam or depth of deception documented in this paper, let alone the irreversible long term ramifications implied therein for their collective future. They are encouraged instead to believe that `The Price is Right' for `The Sale of The Century'. `It won't happen overnight, but it will happen'. . . `oh what a feeling'. . . `please consider'.</PARA>

<TIME.STAMP>(10.33 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Moreton Bay is one of Australia's foremost environmentally sensitive areas on the doorstep to south&hyphen;east Queensland. Moreton Bay has some of Australia's most impressive island habitats&mdash;not that I am biased, because they are the centrepiece of my electorate&mdash;but because these islands provide a recreational playground second to none in the world. The bay supports an important fishing and boating community and is enjoyed not only by my constituents along the foreshores of Redland and Wynnum&hyphen;Manly, but also by many more who travel great distances for the pleasures of a bayside lifestyle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To fully appreciate the future viability of this area as a recreational and prosperous business community, the relevant jurisdictions need to manage carefully the interchange between population, flora and fauna, and the resources within the boundaries of the bay. To closely monitor and add to the collective knowledge that needs to be documented, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ongoing, active, hands&hyphen;on research needs to be continued.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A marine laboratory was established at Dunwich in 1949 by the state Department of Harbours and Marine. It was shared by the CSIRO's Fisheries Division and the University of Queensland. The UQ took over the site in 1961 from Harbours and Marine and put in a caretaker. Since then, this facility has been used by many departments and schools, as well as by international groups who pursue active field research in this prime marine habitat. The station has increased its usage to almost continuous usage by students and researchers from many and varied fields of study.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of other significance, this field station helped develop the study of marine science in Queensland. Many of its graduates have gone on to further study and research, and the North Queensland field station of marine studies could be said to have its roots and origins in the activities of students from the Dunwich field station.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over time, the facility has deteriorated to the point that major repairs are no longer possible. Restructuring and redesigning of the facility is required to upgrade it to world&hyphen;class standards. The work carried out from the station into Moreton Bay is vital, and all jurisdictions&mdash;local, state and federal interests&mdash;would be better served with the upgrade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Professor Jack Greenwood, and the Director of Marine Science at UQ, Dr Ian Tibbits, have stressed that research into Moreton Bay has to continue, particularly with the ever increasing growth in urban development along the foreshores. Currently, the station is in need of an upgrade to the tune of $250,000. That would improve the shell of the building to start with. DEET funding has been approved to upgrade the interior. A later stage would see the dormitory and canteen facilities improved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This project is an investment in future generations' use of the bay and its environs. The challenge is overcoming environmental limitations due to so many unknown factors. Federal funding has been forthcoming for aquiculture projects through the CSIRO and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5961"> landcare projects to monitor waterways in the Redland area. The whole bay&mdash;flora and fauna, fishing and built communities&mdash;benefit from a commitment to research right in the middle of the bay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The assistance to Moreton Bay of the application of the clean seas initiative from the partial sale of Telstra will see these things carried out. Without those proceeds, these initiatives to oversight the long&hyphen;term future of Moreton Bay will not happen. The hope of local councils, for university programs, research and development and forward thinking environmental solutions to challenges facing our coastal area will not be lost without the injection of major capital funding for vital environmental monitoring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the future of Moreton Bay, and all those other bays around coastal areas where ocean outfall and the pressure of increasing population are problems, the partial sale of Telstra has to go ahead. I put it to the House that, for the future of our bay environment, the clean seas program must see the light of day.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<TIME.STAMP>(10.37 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, the matter that I wish to raise tonight goes to the very heart of the notion of propriety and good government. I wish to draw attention to the striking similarity between some of the conflicts affecting the awarding of the advertising and PR contracts for the national gun control campaign, and the irregularities involved in the awarding of the casino licence by the Kennett government in Victoria.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both the casino licence tender and the gun control contracts have been contaminated on a number of occasions. Premier Kennett said of the process for the casino tender:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have always said during the tendering process that we would not be involved in discussions with them (Crown) simply because the only appropriate place for the discussion is with the casino authority.</PARA>
<PARA>He also said that he instructed his ministers not to meet or discuss casino issues with Crown. Later he admitted that he had met with Lloyd Williams of Crown to discuss casino matters.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) needs to clarify whether DDB Needham Adelaide visited his office the day after they were placed on the short list and whether they discussed the advertising contract. Any discussions would have compromised the integrity of the tendering process. His responses today provided no answers about the role played by his office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister's senior political adviser, Mr Grahame Morris, intervened to have DDB Needham Adelaide included in the pitch list of five firms. He further intervened to have DDB Needham included on the short list, and we know this as fact. How can he claim impartiality and an open mind on the ministerial committee when he has already taken these extraordinary measures on DDB Needham's behalf?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Conflicts of interest undermine the fairness of tendering processes. They also undermine the appearance of impartiality. The process for the awarding of the casino licence to Crown was dogged with a number of examples of conflicts of it. Ron Walker, as chairman of Melbourne Major Events Corporation, and Lloyd Williams knew that Melbourne had won the right to stage the Australian Grand Prix when they were bidding for the casino licence. None of the other tenderers were privy to this information, which placed them at a severe disadvantage in terms of forecasting future revenue and hence formulating the value of their bids.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In April 1994, Lloyd Williams purchased land from Dinner Plain Pty Ltd for $150,000. Professor McIntyre, Chair of the Planning Panel for the Casino Authority, is a director and shareholder in Dinner Plain Pty Ltd, and also designed Mr Williams' ski lodge. Michael Barlow, another member of the planning panel, was a director of an architectural firm, A.T. Cox, and acted for Hudson Conway in the redevelopment of Tooronga Village.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has stated that Crown won the licence on the basis of design, rather than for financial reasons. The planning committee was crucial to Crown's success. The public should have been aware of Professor McIntyre's and Michael Barlow's conflicts of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5962"> interest. The national gun control advertising process also suffered from conflicts of interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members of the ministerial committee on government communication have longstanding connections with those who have benefited from these contracts. Senator Minchin and Grahame Morris have both worked closely with DDB Needham Adelaide on Liberal Party campaigns. Toby Ralph, Ted Horton and John King, all of DDB Needham Adelaide, are well known to members of the ministerial committee. The member for Kooyong, Mr Georgiou&mdash;the only backbench member ever of the ministerial committee&mdash;has also worked with the DDB Needham family on Liberal Party campaigns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Kennett government approved the expansion of the Crown Casino from 360 hotel rooms to 1,000 and from 200 gaming tables to 350. These changes occurred after the tender was awarded to Crown. DDB Needham Adelaide, since being awarded their contract, have substantially rewritten their advertising strategy and the budget for the campaign has been expanded from $1 million to $2.88 million. The whole campaign is running behind schedule.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The conduct of the Kennett government in awarding the casino licence shattered the faith of investors in the fairness of the Victorian government's tendering process. Jim Gallagher, of ITT Sheraton, declared that they would not bid for any state government contracts as a consequence of their treatment during the Victorian casino process. Similarly, John Bevins Advertising and Foote Cone and Belding Sydney, two of the unsuccessful bidders, have both said that the experience had convinced them not to pitch for government business again. Sham tendering processes that reward government mates hurt the interests of the Victorian and federal governments because reputable firms will refuse to tender.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise here tonight to condemn what I see as one of the most insidious factors holding our economy back from its rightful course to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> recovery&mdash;the seeming price grab in diesel fuel prices by the multinational oil companies that hold our nation to ransom because of deregulation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently, fuel prices in Cairns rose another 1c per litre&mdash;the third price hike in as many weeks&mdash;hitting an all&hyphen;time high of 76.9c, more than 9c dearer than this time last year, or an increase of over 13 per cent in a 12&hyphen;month period, and 3c dearer than unleaded petrol. This is absolutely shameless opportunism by these multinationals and it is well past the time that this government stepped in and brought these international price pirates into line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a feeble attempt to explain what can only be seen as price manipulation, the last reason the oil companies gave to fuel distributors as to why diesel prices were rising in Far North Queensland and across Australia generally was the lame excuse that an excessively cold Northern Hemisphere winter was forcing prices up. That was nearly 12 months ago. Well, the Northern Hemisphere has come out of that winter, gone through spring and summer, and is now into autumn again, and yet diesel prices not only have not come down but have continued to increase.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These fuel companies are holding Australian small business to ransom at a time when the rest of the community is looking towards an improvement in the nation's financial state, by ripping off not only our small business people but every Australian, particularly those in regional areas like my seat of Leichhardt, through excessive prices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The massive excessive profits that oil companies have been making since deregulation first raised its ugly head under the Hawke government in 1983 have been pointed out to the recent petrol pricing inquiry, and since the dismantling of regulating price controls following that the only winners have been the oil companies, and the massive losers have been Australian consumers, motorists and especially those in businesses whose activities have a major fuel component.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The average price of crude oil purchased by Australia in 1982&hyphen;83 was $35.21 per barrel. At this time last year, Gippsland crude could be bought for $16.50 per barrel, but where <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5963"> were the discounts to the consumer that should have been passed on?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now have the crazy situation where, on the international spot oil market, for some reason or another you can buy a barrel of petrol&mdash;yes, I mean refined petrol&mdash;cheaper than you can buy a barrel of crude. If you call that rational economics, then I am glad I do not run my own business that way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead of the Australian Consumer and Competition Commission looking at letting supermarkets sell petrol, this country should be looking at introducing the strongest possible anti&hyphen;competition sanctions against the oil companies, as these people have now proven that they cannot be trusted with deregulation and should be shunned by the rest of those of us in the Australian business community who are trying to make a `fair go' of a very unlevel playing field.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<ELECTORATE> (Namadgi)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(10.45 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I take the opportunity to talk about the sort of commitment that parents and volunteers make within many an electorate around this country but particularly in my electorate of Namadgi. When I say that, I am talking especially about the participation rate in winter sports within my community of Namadgi.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am fortunate to be involved in a number of clubs, particularly junior ones in the area. Without the volunteer work of the parents and other people who attach themselves to these clubs, I am sure we would not see the success rate that we do. My electorate has one of the highest participation rates in sporting activity that you would see in the country for the age group that I am talking about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tonight I want to particularly refer to my association&mdash;although I have many associations with many clubs&mdash;with the Tuggeranong Junior Bulldogs Club, of which I happen to be patron. This club represents a very large number of junior Aussie rules footballers in the electorate and has a participation rate that demands of the organisers, all of whom are volunteers, a huge commitment. The result of the commitment from those people can be seen in the success of the club and in the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> delight that the young people have in their participation in their sport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one particular young man in that club that I would like to give a special mention to tonight. His name is Steve Hall. He has been in the Tuggeranong Junior Bulldogs junior sides since the under&hyphen;8s. His early years with the club included selection in a number of ACT development squads and the captaincy of his own club side.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Back in March of 1995, Steve was unfortunately diagnosed with lymphatic cancer. This in fact happened just four days before he was to enjoy his first experience with the ACT in the under&hyphen;15s squad. Throughout 1995 he underwent intensive chemotherapy and radiotherapy. He was too sick to play at all last season, undergoing several long periods in hospital with serious infection as a result of that treatment. Steve worked very hard on his fitness over last summer and set his sights this year on playing for the Bulldogs under-17s and training with the ACT under&hyphen;16 national schoolboys squad, both of which goals he achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The two things that are noteworthy here are that, first of all, he could not have done this without his own determination, his own love of the game and his own commitment to the other young people with whom he plays the game. Secondly, his father especially and his family really supported Steve to the hilt and gave him every encouragement to continue through that difficult time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was fortunate enough as patron of the club to be invited last month to the annual presentation night. One of the most joyous things that I could have done that evening was present Steve with a Youth Football Achievement Award, which was given to him at the club by the club for his example of commitment, let alone skill, displayed in the sport. It is obvious that Steve has a great affection for the game, but it is also obvious that he is very good at it. He receives a lot of admiration from his fellow young people, and it is a delight to see the reaction of the under&hyphen;8s, the under&hyphen;9s and the under&hyphen;10s who pay attention to the kids who are senior to them who have come through similar ranks.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5964">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have no doubt, having met Steve and having met his family briefly and having talked to people within that club, that this young man can probably achieve anything he wishes to in his lifetime. His achievement, along with the performances of the former Tuggeranong ACTAFL players Aaron Hamill and Justin Blumfield, who have now got to AFL level, provides tremendous encouragement for the other young sporting people, but particularly sporting footballers, in the Tuggeranong valley. At that presentation night, when a trophy and a shield went out to a couple of under&hyphen;8s, they saw the name of Aaron Hamill, who had done his junior football through the same club and is now playing first&hyphen;grade AFL. The look on their faces when they saw what they could achieve from their Tuggeranong urban area and the sort of reaction that those young players have to someone like Steve Hall, I can only say, augurs very well for the future of sport development in our electorate. In conclusion, I congratulate Steve and his family on the hardship that they have come through with flying colours. With the club, I very joyously wish them all the success for the future.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was a particularly moving story delivered by a very warm and caring member. I appreciated having the opportunity to listen to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to talk about agricultural shows and what flows from them. In my electorate of Dickson there are two agricultural shows and, bordering on my electorate, there is a further agricultural show. In my opinion, these are part of a  great culture in this country. What they foster is a number of particular things that bring the community together: they bring the country together and they bring the city together. As far as Brisbane is concerned, the ultimate show, the Royal National Association Show in August, brings again that marriage of the country and the city.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More particularly, as I have noticed in the Pine Rivers show and in the Samford show, it brings out the great Australian sport of woodchopping. I am someone who has followed the woodchops for a long time and I <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> really appreciate the woodchops. I see at the table the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles), who lives in Tasmania, the state of the greatest woodchopper in the world, David Foster, whom he would know. We see David Foster at the royal national show every year and, believe you me, when Foster swings an axe, everyone stands and watches very closely and the wood does not last too long.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I am leading to is this. We have the Olympics coming up in the year 2000. What better way to show the world one of the best demonstration sports than to bring to the world and to the kaleidoscope of atmosphere of the Olympics the great Australian sport of woodchopping?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As members will know and as most of the Australian people will know, there are many aspects of woodchopping. You can have the underhand woodchop, the standing block and of course the tree. One of the greatest spectacles I used to find at the show in Brisbane&mdash;at the Ekka, as they call it&mdash;was the tree event, where the axeman has to cut notches in the tree, climb the tree, chop one side, come back down again, go to the other side of the tree and do the same thing until the block is knocked over. With that event you can also have team relays. The various states line up at the national shows for the relay competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge the organisers of the Olympics to look very seriously at having woodchopping as a demonstration sport to show the world that this is an exciting and uniquely Australian sport. This would also illustrate that you can enjoy sport in an exciting atmosphere and in a real Australian way&mdash;that is, with the noise, colour and movement involved with the chopping of wood.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Agricultural shows are a nursery for these people. It is wonderful to see how the axemen go through the competitions at the shows in the capital cities and exhibit the sport. I beg the Olympic organising committee to look seriously at incorporating woodchopping as an Olympic demonstration sport. I know that a number of sports are being considered. I do not think a decision has been made on which sports to include. I ask them to seriously <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5965"> consider woodchopping because it is one of the finest spectator sports that you can imagine and nobody could doubt that it, more than most other sports, is uniquely Australian.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<TIME.STAMP>(10.54 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Recently I had the privilege of receiving an invitation to attend a function in the grounds of Parliament House. I have to confess that it was certainly one of the more pleasant events that I have attended since coming to this great House. The event was the Praise Corroboree and it was celebrated by the coming together of hundreds of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders as well as non&hyphen;ATSI people in fellowship, with a focus on prayer and healing our land. It was a particularly uplifting experience to see culturally diverse groups come together for a common good. I commend Pastor Peter Walker, President of the Praise Corroboree Association, and the other fine Australians who made this wonderful experience a reality.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was particularly exciting for me to see Tim Edwards and the group of kids from Emmanuel College in Cairns not only attend but also give the lead performance in the evening's concert. They performed magnificently and were a credit to their families and teachers. I must say that I was very proud of these wonderful kids and I have no doubt that each and every one of them has a very bright future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what was very disappointing about the whole event was the lack of interest by the media. Here we have a large group of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people standing up and spreading goodwill and good news, with one of their prime objectives being greater unity between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and fellow Australians. The media obviously did not consider it a significant enough event to report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it amazing that the media will fall over itself to report any negatives within Aboriginal society, be they past treatment, Third World living conditions, corruption and financial abuses, land rights disputes, black deaths in custody and, at present, the relocated children inquiry and the Hanson debate. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Yet when we have an event whereby Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people stand above all the negativity and show the rest of the world that they are responsible, caring, proud Australian citizens, they are virtually ignored. It is a sad indictment of our times when it would appear that only conflict, anger, condemnation, hate and greed sell newspapers or achieve good TV or radio ratings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I, and I am sure many others in this place, would dearly love to see more of the good news stories and the other side of the Aboriginal debate more actively promoted in the media. I call on the media, in the interests of fairness, to give a little bit more time to covering events such as the Praise Corroboree and give recognition to the many fine Australians&mdash;Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and non&hyphen;ATSI people&mdash;who are actively working towards a noble and unified Australia of which all of its people can be justly proud.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr MILES</EMPHASIS> (Braddon&mdash;Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (10.57 p.m.)&mdash;I wish to add my comments to those made by the member for Leichhardt (Mr Entsch). The issue he raised is very important. About 1,000 Aboriginal people were in Canberra for the Praise Corroboree and they came from virtually all over Australia. They travelled thousands of kilometres to get here. If we had two or three Aboriginal people belting on the front doors of Parliament House the media would have been swarming all over them. On this occasion, these people came down as an act of reconciliation and to talk to members of parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many people within Security in Parliament House were concerned about how things would go. While the event was on many people involved with security in Parliament House did not even know these people were here. Their behaviour was exemplary. The organisers took a lot of trouble to ensure that, due to recent events, these people from all over Australia behaved themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Leichhardt has raised a real concern that when Aboriginal people and other Australians get together, share in a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5966"> common cause and a common purpose, very little recognition is given and no mention is made of it in the newspapers. This is a great tragedy. It is one of the reasons there is division in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Peter Walker, an ATSIC commissioner, and others were part of the Praise Corroboree and I want to congratulate them on a marvellous job. It was an excellent idea. I understand that in future they want to repeat this. I hope it becomes bigger and better. The Praise Corroboree here a couple of weeks ago was fabulous. Everybody involved in it should be congratulated. It is a basis for deep, lasting and genuine reconciliation in this country. I add my comments to those of the member for Leichhardt.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Yes, Australia is free of many serious virus and mycoplasma (phytoplasma) diseases of rice and also free of the leafhopper vectors which transmit these diseases to rice. These diseases are Orange leaf MLO, Yellow dwarf MLO, Dwarf, Tungro and its similar diseases Waika and Bunchy stunt; Transitory yellowing, Stripe and Black&hyphen;streaked dwarf, and Rice Gall dwarf phytoreovirus. The South east Asian vectors (Zigzag leafhopper (Recilia dorsalis) and Green leafhoppers (Nephotettix spp.)) and the vectors of these diseases in China and Japan (Laodelphax striatellus, Unkanodes sapporonus, Unkanodes albifascia and Terthron albovittatus) are absent from Australia. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australia is free of the South American disease, Hoja Blanca and its planthopper vector, Sogatodes oryzicola. Giallume is exotic to Australia but a few of its aphid vectors are present in Australia while others (Sitobion avenae) are not. Rice grassy stunt tenuivirus, Wilted stunt virus, and Rice ragged stunt oryzavirus, diseases exotic to Australia, are vectored by the Brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens) which is present in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is also free of serious insect pests of rice namely White&hyphen;backed planthopper (Sogatella furcifera), Malayan black bug (Scotinophara coarctata), Yellow stem borer (Scirpophaga incertulas) and Pink borer (Sesamia inferans), Rice ear bug (Leptocorisa oratoria), Rice leaf folder (Cnaphalocrocis medinalis), other rice stem borers (Rupela albinella and Maliarpha separatella), Gold fringed borer (Chilo auricilia), Spotted stalk borer (Chilo partellus) and Early shoot borer (Chilo infuscatellus), Stinkbug (Oebalus pugnax), and Asian rice gall midge (Orseolia oryzae).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The aquatic snails Pomacia dolioides, Pomacia glauca, Pila globosa and Pila polita which attack seedling rice plants overseas are not present in Australia. Aquatic snails may also act as intermediate hosts for fluke parasites which are absent from Australia. Australia is free of several terrestrial snails and slugs which can also contaminate rice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The mite, Oligonychus oryzae is not known to be present in Australia but can reduce yields up to 25% in India. Rice rust mite (Abacarus oryzae), Cereal rust mite (Abacarus hystrix), Steneotarsonemus spinki and Steneotarsonemus madecassus act as minor virus vectors of rice and grasses overseas but are absent from Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Khapra beetle, Trogoderma granarium, a serious pest of stored rice and other grains is absent from Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Yes. The pesticide use on rice in Australia is considerably less than that in Asia. This results from the fact that the main rice&hyphen;growing area in Australia (the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area) is in a temperate area of the country free of the tropical pests of rice (eg stem borers, planthoppers) and is isolated from other rice growing areas. New South Wales also has no recorded virus or phytoplasma diseases of rice. Insecticides (Chlorpyrifos, replacing Maldison) is used only as a preventative for bloodworm control (Chironomus tepperi, a midge) during the 4 weeks when plants are small. No insecticide is used after this stage except for control of armyworm but this practice is rarely used and is actively discouraged by the rice industry to avoid spraying close to harvest. The rice industry has also replaced its reliance on insecticide use on stored grain with physical control methods. Herbicides are still required for weed control in rice but their use is less than that used overseas. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5971"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"> (3) AQIS was first advised in November 1991 by the Australian Museum, Sydney of the presence of Pomacaea canaliculatain Australia following the identification of specimens received over two years previously from Western Australia. The identity of the snail had posed some difficulty (it was known as `mystery snail' in the aquarium industry) and may be the same species as that recorded in Thailand as Pila ampullacea. This snail was said to have been traded for some (probably as long as ten) years in the Australian aquarium trade and to be actively bred at least two localities for shipment Australia&hyphen;wide. It was on sale in aquarium shops in Brisbane in 1993. As AQIS has no record of imports of this snail it is assumed to have been brought to Australia illegally or accidentally with fish. It is a native of Argentina and was introduced to Taiwan as food in 1980 from whence it has been carried to Japan (1981), the Philippines (1982) and is now widespread in Asia (Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia), Hawaii and Papua New Guinea. AQIS's view is that there is presently no evidence that the snail is established in the wild in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) AQIS understands that following the location of suspect snails on sale in a pet shop in Griffith in March 1994, which were subsequently identified as Golden apple snail by overseas experts, the NSW Department of Agriculture in Griffith, with the cooperation of the pet industry and the Australian Museum, suspended sales of this snail in NSW and began testing the snail as to its tendency to eat rice plants. The pet industry had maintained it only feeds on algae on the aquarium walls but subsequent testing by the NSW Department of Agriculture confirmed that it ate rice plants. Proclamation No 70727 under the Plant Diseases Act was passed by NSW on 10 November 1995, declaring Golden apple snail and snails of the family Ampullariidae pests in New South Wales. The second part of this legislation, which is not yet in place, will ban the snail from the rice quarantine areas. Coincidentally, the rice quarantine area is being extended and this legislation is due to go before the NSW Parliament shortly. It will require owners and occupiers of land within the quarantine area to destroy snail and snail eggs of the family Ampullariidae.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) There are no snail control chemicals registered for use against the Golden apple snail in NSW. There are no molluscicides registered for use in NSW apart from copper sulfate which is also used for algal control. About 1% of farms may be affected by 1 cm&hyphen;sized local aquatic snails whose populations build up in response to rainfall. If the snail numbers pose a risk to crop establishment, fields are aerially treated with granular copper sulfate as needed following the aerial sowing of the pregerminated rice into the flooded fields. Because Golden apple snail is a much larger snail, copper sulfate's effectiveness against it is unproven. Although copper tends to drop out of solution <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> quickly into the mud, the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) and the Australian and New Zealand Environmental Council (ANZEC) have established guidelines on drainage water management which must be met by growers using this treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) The NSW Department of Agriculture is aware of controls that are being applied in the Philippines against Golden apple snail. These chemicals (eg niclosamide) are not registered for use in NSW against aquatic snails. Growers are aware of the use of copper sulfate in NSW against snails but would be unaware of the control problems that Golden apple snail would cause if it were to become established in the wild. The methods used to control Golden apple snail in other States (both in the aquarium trade or release into the wild) differ from activities occurring in NSW. Victorian authorities have not found Golden Apple Snail in that State and Victoria has no specific quarantine measures for this pest. Following the passage of the NSW legislation extending the quarantine area, a publicity campaign aimed at alerting rice growers to recognise Golden apple snail would most likely follow.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The overwhelming response from Customs Officers involved with this issue is that the recent amendments to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations have achieved the goals of implementing the Australasian Police Ministers' Council resolutions and of providing a legislative framework which is much simpler to interpret.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Any regulation which covers as wide a range of goods and involves as complex a series of tests and requirements as the import controls on firearms will almost inevitably provide some scope for interpretation. Administrative guidelines have been issued to ensure that Customs interpret the new regulation in a consistent and uniform manner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) There may well be differences between the regulations and the provisions of the Western Australia Firearms Act. The purpose of the amendments was to implement the resolutions of the special Australasian Police Ministers' Council meeting by implementing more stringent controls on the importation of automatic and semi automatic firearms in the existing controls. The resolutions requires all States and Territories to introduce minimum standards regarding licensing and possession of firearms. However, there was never any intention that the Commonwealth legislation should mirror that of Western Australia or any other State or Territory.</PARA>
