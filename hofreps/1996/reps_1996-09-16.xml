<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3E4">Mrs SULLIVAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the Procedure Committee's first report of the 38th Parliament. It relates to an inquiry that the committee was asked to undertake at the end of the last parliament but did not have time to commence before the election intervened.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In November of last year the committee was asked by the then Leader of the House to look at the operation of standing order 143 which provides for questions without notice to be asked of private members. Under this standing <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> order, questions can be asked of members in charge of an item of private members business, committee chairs and parliamentary representatives on statutory bodies, on matters relating to those items.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This provision has seldom been used in the past. In 95 years, only 18 questions have been asked of private members under this provision. Rulings over the years have fairly consistently confined the questions and their answers to procedural or factual matter rather than matters of substantive debate. For example, questions on private members bills and motions have usually been restricted to matters of timing, procedure and, occasionally, to brief explanations of a particular clause of a bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On two occasions last year and one this year, answers by Leaders of the Opposition to questions asked of them about private members' bills which they had introduced, canvassed more substantive issues (such as policy formulation). The 1995 questions prompted the then Leader of the House to ask the Procedure Committee to look at the provision. The new committee in 1996 resolved to pursue his request. It sought the views of the current Leader of the House (Mr Reith) and Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee considered a number of possible changes to try to ensure that questions to private members are not overused or abused. It concluded however that standing order 143 upholds an important principle&mdash;that private members must be responsible for the business they bring before the House and should be able to be questioned about it. In view of the infrequent use of the provision and&mdash;for the most part&mdash;restrictions traditionally placed on the nature and content of the questions and answers, the committee recommends the retention of the standing order in its present form. This accords with the preference of both the Leader of the House and the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean), as stated in their replies to the Procedure Committee's letter to them last session.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Since question time has traditionally been concerned with holding ministers accountable for their actions in the processes of government, the committee is of the view that limi tations on the nature of questions and answers to private members which had applied prior to 1995 and 1996, should be enforced. With the present opportunities available for debating private members business, there should not be a need to use the question time forum to raise substantive issues relating to private members business. I commend the report to the House. I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I present the committee's report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Australian aid program</EMPHASIS> , a report on proceedings of a seminar of 31 July 1996, Canberra, together with minutes of proceedings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ordered that the report be printed.</PARA>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5T4">Mr BRERETON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Debate on the level and direction of our nation's overseas aid is one of the enduring themes of public policy. The motivation for giving aid intertwines timeless ideals of charity and duty to one's fellow human beings, commitments to justice and the elimination of suffering, and pragmatic concerns to create a more secure world with stable and prosperous trading partners. The vital necessity for aid rests on the persistence of poverty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As honourable members are aware, the United Nations has declared this year as the International Year for the Eradication of Poverty. No member of this parliament would question the necessity for intensifying the international effort to eliminate poverty and social injustice. Between 800 million and 1.3 billion people live in absolute poverty today, about one billion people have no access to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4272"> basic health care services, 1.3 billion have no access to safe water, and two billion have no access to basic sanitation services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Eliminating poverty is certainly neither simple nor easy. Aid is as complicated, as varied and as uncertain as the development process itself. It encompasses the multiple variables of economic and social change, fundamentally important human rights along with the sensitivities of international relations and national sovereignty. The decision of the joint committee to convene the seminar on Australia's overseas aid program held on 31 July this year was prompted by the changes that have occurred since the last comprehensive review of Australia's overseas aid program, the 1984 Jackson report, and the present government's establishment of its new review, chaired by Mr Paul Simons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The seminar also took place against a context of looming budget cuts. These cuts, as announced on 20 August, slashed $114.4 million, or 10 per cent, from the aid program to reduce the ratio of our aid to GNP to an all-time low of 0.29 per cent, a level far below the bipartisan UN endorsed goal of 0.7 per cent of GNP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It remains to be seen what the full implications of these budgets cuts will be on the effectiveness of the aid program and our broader international interests. Suffice to say that our nation's standing in the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region has certainly been damaged by the unilateral termination of agreed projects which were to have been funded by the development import finance facility. We also have to await the outcome of the Simons review, which will no doubt be the subject of lively debate in this parliament and elsewhere. The committee appreciated Mr Simons's presence at the seminar and hopes that he will find the report of these proceedings worth while and that the committee will have an opportunity to meet with him and to discuss his conclusions in due course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Time prevents me from canvassing all the issues raised in the seminar. I would, however, take the opportunity to draw attention to recommendation 10 of the report of the proceedings which, as in the committee's earlier report on human rights in Burma, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> affirms the importance of Australia's human rights objectives as an integral, indeed essential, element of the aid program and our nation's broader engagement overseas, including the activities of Australian companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The essentially negative remarks of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Andrew Thomson) on this issue during this seminar were disappointing, although not surprising. They were, of course, entirely consistent with what appears to be the government's essentially laissez-faire approach to human rights and labour rights, in particular. As the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) put it in China last month, it appears to be the case that `business is business'. I do not intend to make a partisan point today, but I do say that respect for human rights in the Asia&hyphen;Pacific is a foreign policy issue which will not go away no matter how much the government or anyone else may want it to do so. It cannot be quietly swept under the carpet and the government can expect strong criticism of any further attempts to do so, be it in relation to Tibet, Burma, Indonesia or anywhere else in our region and beyond.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The committee welcomed all of the participants at the seminar. The involvement of many members of the business community was especially welcome, as it seemed to the committee that there is scope for the development of a proactive dialogue between government, business and non-government organisations in the contributions that each can make to the other's performance. The exchanges clearly were lively and, despite the short time available, managed to raise a good number of seminal issues. I hope this report will stimulate debate in the parliament. I commend it to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is appropriate that, albeit briefly, we discuss this report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade this morning, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Australian aid program</EMPHASIS> . It is a first in this parliament. I think it is the first report to the parliament of a similar sort of seminar in the last two or three parliaments. So it is a very important one. Having been involved in that seminar, I think it gave <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4273"> a good interplay between the bureaucracy, members of the parliament, the NGOs, business, as the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton) has pointed out, academia and, most importantly, as a precursor to the Simons review, which is to be the first major review of aid since the Jackson report some 12 years ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to make the point right at the outset that the raison d'etre for continuing aid is the persistence of poverty, which is one of the points made very early in the report as a result of this seminar. I take this opportunity to compliment the chairman of the committee, the right honourable member for new England (Mr Sinclair), on his initiative. It was a very large initiative of his. I congratulate him on that. I am pleased to see that we have Margaret Swieringa in the House. Margaret was heavily involved in the preparation of this report. We all owe her a debt of gratitude for producing the report in very short order. She and Joanne Towner were members of the secretariat. I thank them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the issues that were raised at the seminar it is worth while in the very short time available to us to read into the record the sorts of issues that were raised. The nature of the need for development assistance was raised. Was poverty increasing or decreasing in the world today? To what extent was there a polarisation between the rich and the poor? The overall level of the aid budget, mentioned by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith, both nationally and internationally was raised, as was the decline in ADA in the face of rising numbers of poor and the significance of other flows, particularly private investment flows. Was Australia's contribution sufficient? Were its aims still directed at poverty alleviation or had they become corrupted? How was aid best directed to meet its objectives? What role did government NGOs and private business have to play in the provision of aid? Finally, the ever increasing demand for disaster relief and its effect on development assistance was raised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is some conjecture and debate about the degree of the ADA/GDP ratio raised by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith. It is not the appropriate time to get partisan <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> on that issue today but I point out to everybody that there has been an erosion of that percentage from 0.5 per cent of GDP since the Jackson report down to what we have in the 1996-97 budget levels, of 0.29 per cent. I have to say to the honourable member opposite that, whilst he may regard the contribution of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Thomson), to that seminar as being negative, I do not. I think that it was a pragmatic contribution. What was decided on 25 August was consistent with the budgetary climate in which we found ourselves. So I would have to agree to disagree with the honourable member opposite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the bilateral and multilateral contribution in the 1996&hyphen;97 budget levels, it is worth recording that about 59 per cent of the 1996&hyphen;97 budget will go in the bilateral direction, which is an emphasis of our government, whilst 30 per cent will be focused into multilateral agencies. In the bilateral area it is appropriate to reinforce some of the percentages: 43 per cent goes to the PNG and South Pacific regions and about the same goes to east and southern Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an important report. It shows the differences which have to be taken into consideration: humanitarian, commercial, foreign policy and security. Like the honourable member opposite, we all look forward to the results of the Simons inquiry.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The seminar on the Australian aid program held in Canberra on 31 July was valuable and enlightening. The Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade later recommended:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a member of the DAC the Government reaffirm its commitment to achieving the ODA/GNP target of 0.7 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>The acronyms should be explained. DAC is the Development Assistance Committee&mdash;in effect, the 20 donor nations. ODA is the abbreviation for Global Official Development Assistance, although, as you would point out instantly, Mr Acting Speaker, GODA would have been more complete. Gross national product, GNP, is used rather than gross <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4274"> domestic product, GDP. GNP equals GDP plus earnings from foreign investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 0.7 per cent target was set by the United Nations many years ago and has been honoured more in the breach than in the observance, to coin a phrase. Although public opinion surveys indicate 60 per cent support for the concept of overseas aid, the honourable member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) notwithstanding, Australia has never reached the target. In 1995 the ODA/GNP ratio fell from 0.3 per cent to 0.29 per cent. In the 1996 budget there was a further cut of $114.4 million or 10 per cent down on the previous year. The bulk of the cut, $93.4 million, came from the abolition of the development import finance facility, or DIFF, scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, of the DAC members, only four nations exceed the 0.7 per cent target. Of the four, three are from Scandinavia and the fourth is the Netherlands: Denmark, 0.97 per cent; Norway, 0.87 per cent; Sweden, 0.85 per cent; and the Netherlands, 0.8 per cent. Then comes France on 0.55 per cent, followed by Canada on 0.39 per cent, Belgium on 0.38 per cent, and then Australia and Switzerland are level&hyphen;pegging. Coming next is Germany on 0.31 per cent, the United Kingdom on 0.29 per cent and Japan on 0.28 per cent. All are ahead of the DAC weighted average. Then it goes down, and the lowest nation on the list, I regret to say, is the United States where the figure is 0.1 per cent. Of course, in absolute dollar terms, that would be a very significant amount, but the percentage is disappointingly low.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Table 2.3 points out that since 1968 there has been a growing discrepancy between the per capita GNP in Australia and Australia's per capita spending on overseas aid. It can be seen that 1968 was the last year when the two lines on the graph overlapped. Since then the gap has been growing wider and wider.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to point out that, with the aid program, it is not as if the Australian government simply hands out cash. The aid is very much targeted and, of course, it leads to the export of Australian expertise and products. So, in a sense, the great bulk of the money is spent domestically and then the value is exported. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirty per cent of the aid goes towards total social infrastructure and services, 10.5 per cent towards economic infrastructure and services, 4.9 per cent only towards assistance in production, and then there are a whole complex of other sectors, including emergency assistance, which together add up to 100 per cent. So the total ODA from Australia is of the order of $1&half; billion&mdash;a very substantial amount in absolute figures. Nevertheless, the needs in the area generally continue to rise and increasingly, if we think of the kind of world that we want to live in, we need to&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also would like to add my congratulations to the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, which produced this report. It is an excellent report. For people who want to get an understanding of what the overseas aid program is all about, a reading of this report not only focuses on that but also canvasses a number of the issues and tensions that exist in the broad debate on the aid budget. There is no doubt that the aid budget is controversial and I take the point that the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) has made that many people probably share, as he referred to indirectly, the view of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) that we should cut the aid program completely. I certainly do not share that view and I endorse the benchmark of 0.7 per cent of GDP that is set by the United Nations. I think it is very desirable that there be bipartisan support for that target.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point is made in the report that Australia is a wealthy country, despite the present economic circumstances in which we find ourselves. It was unfortunate&mdash;the member for Groom (Mr Taylor) made the point&mdash;that the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith (Mr Brereton) became very political in criticising the current budget. We can rationalise that, we can explain that those cuts had to be made across the board, and I think that that is unfortunate because I am strongly committed to foreign aid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the point that the member for Groom made ought not be lost on the opposition; that is, this has been trending down for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4275"> a long time to the point that it has now reached. I think it would be desirable, and I hope there would be partisan support, to see it move back up again as soon as our economic circumstances allow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a lot of things in this report that I think are important. The value of the aid program to Australia, section 2, explains very clearly for people who do not understand why we do get involved in aid. I made the point that we are wealthy despite our circumstances, but the fact is that we get involved in aid for a variety of reasons both idealistic and pragmatic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the first instance, the report said that aid is a moral and humanitarian imperative and Australia is a wealthy country despite economic difficulties, but it goes on to point out that in many of the countries where our aid is directed poverty breeds disease, civil unrest and terrorism which in turn precludes economic development and it is in Australia's interest to assist in the creation of a more secure environment in the region. Furthermore, rising standards of living in neighbouring countries improve markets for our exports. Further, if you want a stronger rationale, the report makes the point that 90 per cent of the aid budget is spent in Australia on a variety of goods and services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a very defensible and arguable rationale for aid that we need to sell to the community. It takes real leadership, in effect, in the community to sell that particular story. It is not easy to go out. It is easy in a sense to stand up in this place and say, `We are wealthy. The countries we are helping are extremely poor and in some cases Australia has a GDP 200 times the GDPs of these countries we are helping.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe we have a responsibility for a whole lot of pragmatic reasons on the one hand and humanitarian reasons on the other for helping these people. As I say, the 1996 budget led to a further reduction in aid for a whole lot of reasons. I am one who is prepared to stand up as a government member and say that that is unfortunate. I would like to see that reversed as our circumstances improve, which no doubt they will in the reasonably short term.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other interesting feature I found in reading this report was the crystallisation of the debate on economic growth versus aid per se and whether aid needs to be directed purely towards those sorts of economic ends or whether there needed to be just a need for aid. I thought the discussion in this report was very balanced. It was very helpful to me as a member to crystallise the elements of that debate. For anyone reading it outside of here, I think it would be very helpful in understanding those issues as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other recommendation which I think was very worth while was recommendation No. 6, which flowed on from that discussion, that the government give priority in the aid program to areas of greatest poverty and places which could not attract private flows of capital. In many respects, our aid program can enhance those flows of capital and projects can lead to that, but there are many other areas where poverty is just so endemic that nothing short of pure humanitarian aid is going to be the answer. I am one in this House who will want to stand up and support that sort of aid. I congratulate the committee for this report. I think it is very good work.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to present the report of the Standing Committee on Communications, Transport and Microeconomic Reform on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Keeping rural Australia posted</EMPHASIS> . The inquiry was first referred in the previous parliament and subsequently re&hyphen;referred in this parliament. Dropped from the previous terms of reference was the reference into Australia Post's capacity to maintain or increase community service obligations if its reserve letter rate was reduced, but an additional item was included in the new terms of reference covering the establishment of a charter of responsibilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People in the bush rely on Australia Post. To seek the views of the people in rural and remote Australia the committee in the 37th Parliament held a series of public meetings in Horsham, Mildura, Broken Hill, Armidale, Grafton, Kingaroy, Mount Isa, Tennant Creek, Yuendumu, Alice Springs, Leigh Creek, Broome, Nullagine, Geraldton, Albany and Lenora. In addition, the committee met with representatives from key interest groups including the School of the Air, the Isolated Children's Parents Association and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations. Five days of public hearings were held and the committee observed operations at a number of rural post offices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee has made 20 recommendations in its report. In my time today I cannot cover all those important recommendations in detail, but I would like to make some comments on a few. The focus of the committee's inquiry is Australia Post's community service obligations. The committee supports the need for a standard letter rate in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the critical issues the committee examined was how community service obligations are paid for. Some of the evidence to the inquiry suggested that budgetary payments should be used instead of the current system of cross-subsidies. The committee rejects this <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> proposal. If cross&hyphen;subsidies were removed, it would be possible that people in rural and remote areas could have their services downgraded in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee notes that Australia Post might be able to operate at a reduced level of protection and continue to cross&hyphen;subsidise the cost of community service obligations, but the committee warns against reducing the level of protection beyond the point at which Australia Post's ability to provide services to people, including those in rural and remote areas, are put at risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee has some concerns about the viability of some licensed post offices and community postal agencies and has made recommendations on the issue of viability and possible additional services to improve their viability. The committee believes that the needs of the people are important and has made recommendations regarding the 80,000 delivery points which do not receive a to-the-property delivery, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, students studying by distance education and people requiring a regular supply of medicine. The report includes recommendations on performance measures relating to Australia Post, including extending powers of the Auditor-General to comment on the appropriateness of performance targets set by Australia Post.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the new terms of reference, the committee was asked to look at the establishment of a charter of responsibilities for Australia Post. The committee concludes that a wider investigation is needed into a charter of responsibilities&mdash;the focus of this inquiry is Australia Post's rural and remote delivery services&mdash;but a charter of responsibilities would apply to all postal users, who should be given an opportunity to have their say at that level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The conduct of the inquiry would not have been possible without the help of the community and my colleagues, and I thank them for their contributions. I note in particular the work done by the Hon. Peter Morris, the chairman of the previous committee in the 37th Parliament; the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur), the deputy chairman of the previous committee; Mr Harry Woods, who is no longer in this place <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4277"> but who was also a key involvee in the previous inquiry&mdash;they gave so much of their time visiting rural and remote Australia to attend the inquiry's public meetings&mdash;and certainly the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) for his contribution. In addition, I thank Mr Stephen Boyd, who was the inquiry secretary, and all those others in the secretariat&mdash;Malcolm Aldons and more recently Meg Crooks&mdash;for their assistance in going through the draft report stages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should acknowledge again the involvement of all members of the committee, both in the 37th Parliament and in the 38th Parliament. It has been an enjoyable inquiry to work on, albeit I was involved in only the 38th Parliament. I am sure subsequent speakers will make comments on the activities of the committee in the 37th Parliament. I commend the report to the House. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to commend the Chairman of the new Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Microeconomic Reform, the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), on his rapid processing of this report. He and the new committee picked things up very quickly and I think that is a great credit to the committee process of this parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to thank everyone who was associated with the presentation of the committee report, particularly the former House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure of the 37th Parliament. I especially thank the committee secretary, Malcolm Aldons; the inquiry secretary, Mr Stephen Boyd; and Mrs June Murphy of the committee office, who did most of the organisational work and preparation duties that are involved in these kinds of activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I especially want to thank my former deputy chairman, the member for Corangamite and now Government Whip (Mr McArthur), for his contribution and his great cooperation. We worked as a very good team. I would like to include also the former member for Page, Harry Woods, the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), and the member for Hinkler (Mr Neville). They did almost all <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the country meetings and inspections. It was a very good team effort on the part of the committee and the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The submissions came to a total of some 249. Unusual in inquiries of this nature, a large number of the submissions&mdash;at one stage it was running to almost half of the submissions&mdash;supported the task being performed by Australia Post. They were not complaining about Australia Post; we had a difficulty at one stage trying to find somebody who had a problem with Australia Post. They were very complimentary of the standard of service. We are talking about country Australians, so that gives a flavour of the nature of the task the committee addressed. I would like to commend Australia Post also for their readiness to provide information. There was no difficulty or problem in the speediness with which they responded to what we wanted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some 20 recommendations in all in the report, but there are a few key issues that come out. One is the cost of community service obligations&mdash;there was also the definition of community service obligations; this issue is going to come back to us later&mdash;and a second is how they  should be paid for, whether it is in the budget or whether it is cross-subsidy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also involved in all of this is the ability of statutory authorities or public sector enterprises to perform their duties, to operate as business enterprises. I told the House back in May 1988 that communications and transport enterprises need more than ever before flexibility to respond rapidly to changes in the market and to take up opportunities as they present themselves. Australia Post is an excellent example of that in practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much credit must go to the managing director of Australia Post, who came in in 1990, Rae Taylor AM. To make a comparison, the dividends from Australia Post in 1988-89-90 were $1 million and $120 million in 1994-95. Would that the private sector could perform like that on some occasions. That transformation is very much due to everybody involved&mdash;the managing director, his staff, and the employees in the transformation to team work that came from them.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4278">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Effectively, community service obligations are, in practical terms one can say, without going into the details, the right of an Australian to post a standard letter from anywhere in Australia to anywhere in Australia for 45c. Obviously in some places it costs less than 45c. On other occasions it costs many times greater than 45c. When we are talking about a community service obligation we mean the right of a reasonable access to a mail delivery service and the right to be able to post a standard letter from anywhere to anywhere for 45c.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The debate rages about how to pay for it&mdash;it is a key issue&mdash;either from the budget or from cross-subsidisation within Australia Post. I can do no better than the evidence that came from the Deputy Secretary of the Department of Finance at our hearing of 26 October 1995. Mr Hutchinson was asked for a view by the member for Corangamite about putting these community service obligations on budget. This is most unusual for the Department of Finance, but Mr Hutchinson responded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not the Department of Finance's position that the costs of Australia Post CSOs should be met by the budget. We come to that view, as you might expect, somewhat reluctantly because of the transparency and accountability advantages that come with budget funding but&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr McARTHUR</EMPHASIS> &mdash;You take the money, you take a lot of revenue. Why would you not just offset that with the CSO and the budget?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr Hutchinson</EMPHASIS> &mdash;Indeed, there would be some advantages in doing that. But because of the inextricability of the services that deliver CSOs, with the services that are commercial, and because the incentives on Australia Post with cross-subsidy are to improve services in a way that not only reduces the costs of commercial services but also reduces the cost of CSOs, we think that public interest in delivering whatever level of CSO output the government and Australia Post between them decide is desirable at the lowest cost, is best served by internalising the funding of the CSOs . . .</PARA>
<PARA>And so it goes on. Mr Acting Speaker, I thank you for your indulgence and I thank fellow committee members. I commend the recommendations of the report to the House. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to support the report of the House of Representatives Standing Com <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> mittee on Communications, Transport and Microeconomic Reform. I thank the former chairman, the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris), for his kind remarks and reciprocate his remarks relating to the good cooperation on that committee. I commend Mr Stephen Boyd, the committee's secretary, for an excellent report and a very good, professional assessment of the attitudes that were portrayed during the hearings and in the final report. I also thank Malcolm Aldons and June Murphy for their assistance on what was a very big and enduring inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those of us who took a strong interest in this inquiry were impressed with Australia's Post's attitude to the inquiry. I put on record the good performance of Australia Post since 1989: the standard letter rate has been maintained at 45c from 1992 to 1997, which is an outstanding achievement in itself; there has been a 6.2 per cent productivity improvement in a highly labour intensive industry; 93 per cent of letters are delivered on time, according to their own schedule; the profit before tax in the last year was $331 million; and there has been a 16.5 per cent return on assets and a $120 million dividend return to government. As the member for Shortland quite rightly says, we have seen a big change from Australia Post pre-1989.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia Post ranks fourth in the international table of costing, with New Zealand at 42c, Canada at 44c, USA at 44c and Australia at 45c, compared with Germany at 99c and Japan at $1.31. Given an international league table, Australia Post compete very well and they also return a good rate of return to their shareholder.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other members have indicated the extensive visits that the committee took to all parts of Australia. It was interesting to talk to local people. I support the remarks from the many submissions and verbal support saying that Australia Post had done a good job. There was very little genuine criticism of Australia Post's performance both in the urban and rural and remote parts of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moving to the commitment that Australia Post has a sound commercial practice, that is obviously a little in conflict with the CSO commitment. If we look at the number of post <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4279"> offices around Australia&mdash;we looked at a great number&mdash;and the comparison, we see that there are 449 corporate post offices, 20,822 licensed post offices, of which there was a lot of debate about their role and their ongoing changing position, 582 post offices, 101 business centres and 363 community mail centres. That amounts to a total of 4,317 outlets that Australia Post is providing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cost of providing services to rural and remote Australia is based on this urban based rate of $93. Surprisingly enough, in country and bush areas we found that people were pleased to have the service, even though they may have used it only once or twice a week. They had a feeling that it was certainly a lot more costly to deliver a letter in Charleville than it would be to deliver it in Ascot Vale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moving to comparisons with other countries, New Zealand has been privatised. It has a deed of understanding. We note that Canada has had no more closures. In our view, Australia Post has been very sensitive about closing post offices, extending the operations of some of them and generally meeting community needs. We discussed at some length the community polling of changing the ability of post offices delivering to on property compared with individuals taking their post from boxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Looking at the community service obligation, the main debate is how you calculate it&mdash;whether you have the fully distributed cost method or the stand&hyphen;alone methodology. The fully distributed cost estimates the CSO to be $62 million, whereas the stand&hyphen;alone is $115 million, which again gives a clear indication of the problem. I wish to quote Australia Post's comment at the hearing relating to the key elements of leaving the CSO as a cross&hyphen;subsidy. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do not underestimate the importance of having a culture in our business which has a customer focus, providing service to those customers, a self&hyphen;funding business not reliant on government hand outs.</PARA>
<PARA>I also support the similar comment made by the Deputy Secretary of the Department of Finance, Mr Hutchinson:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the moment, the incentives on all parties are to minimise the costs of CSOs whilst still delivering the desirable outputs.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that clearly identifies the thrust of the committee's report: that we are of a view that there should not be on&hyphen;line budget subsidies, but there should be a cross&hyphen;subsidy by Australia Post itself to those rural and remote users. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the two minutes that are available to me, let me firstly congratulate Australia Post on the tremendous improvement in its performance since the changes were put in place in 1989. As the minister responsible at that time, it is enormously gratifying to me to see what a tremendous improvement in performance there has been in Australia Post over the subsequent years with all the changes referred to by previous speakers. It reflects great credit on Australia Post's board, its management and, of course, its staff.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to the scope for opening Australia Post to further competition, this report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Communications, Transport and Microeconomic Reform does indicate the need for considerable caution in taking further steps. We note the fact that the changes made in 1995&mdash;reducing the reserve services from 10 times to four times the standard letter rate and the weight reduction being halved&mdash;have been coped with very well by Australia Post. That means that that organisation has been able to cope with further competition in a very convincing way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Australia Post said, and we accept, as you get closer to the bone, the impact of further protection cuts are likely to become greater. Therefore, there is a need for considerable caution, particularly if you want to ensure that Australia Post is going to be able to continue to provide its community service obligations and finance them, as we strongly recommend, by way of cross&hyphen;subsidies rather than from the budget. If they are going to be cross&hyphen;subsidised, there needs to be a monopoly area&mdash;a reserve service area&mdash;so that some customers can be charged more than the market rate to  subsidise others. I strongly recommend that the review that takes place <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4280"> into Australia Post's reserve services later this year takes strong note of the committee's recommendations in this area.</PARA>

<PARA>Monday, 19 August was a dark day for Australia's democracy. It will go down in history as a day of shame for the union move <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> ment and Jennie George and a day of shame for the Australian Labor Party, especially for the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley). The protest was a premeditated, un&hyphen;Australian act organised by the ACTU and supported by the Australian Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say at the outset that the Leader of the Opposition will probably try to wash his hands of his involvement in this incident, but let me remind the House of his comments on the day of the protest. He said that the government hated workers, hated students, hated women and hated Aborigines. Obviously in the mind of the Leader of the Opposition the politics of hate still live on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Knowing the Leader of the Opposition as I do privately and publicly, I know him to be a man of some considerable stature in every sense of the word, and I was surprised that he would use such inflammatory language, especially in front of such a mob. But after checking through the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> in recent times, without delving too hard, I found that on at least 13 occasions he has talked in this House about what the coalition hates. So obviously this was premeditated on his behalf because it is language he commonly uses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was intemperate language and, while he will tell us that those comments were made after the riot started, it was a deliberate attempt on his part to incite hatred against the government. It added to the already out of hand riot, and for that he has to stand condemned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that he deliberately used provocative, inflammatory language against the government to influence the crowd to despise the government. His comments, as well as being completely and utterly untrue, were inappropriate for a man who aspires to be Prime Minister of this country. It demeaned him, it demeaned the Labor Party, and it demeaned Australian politics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not hate anyone. I would imagine that most people in this House could stand up and say that they do not hate anyone. To say that we do is puerile. We have a view of the management of government which is different from that of Labor, but to bring hatred into the debate is over the top and not something I would expect from someone of the stature <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4281"> of the Leader of the Opposition, for whom I normally have enormous respect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every member of this place, irrespective of their background, their politics or their philosophy, has a desire to make our society better. There is no hatred in any of us. The Leader of the Opposition owes an apology for his extreme comments. His comments were typical, unfortunately, of many of those protesting on the day, which incited the type of behaviour we unfortunately witnessed. As I said, this was organised by the union movement with the full backing of members opposite, and it was deliberately intended to be violent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those who deny that it was premeditated and not intended to be violent are away with the pixies. Alcohol was served at a breakfast that morning to fuel the emotions of the crowd. Beer was handed out, first to be drunk and then the cans to be used as missiles. That is a recipe for a riot if ever I saw one. The buck stops with those responsible for organising and endorsing the protest, in particular Jennie George, Bill Kelty and the Leader of the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The beer cans that were handed around had a label placed over them which read, `Time to f. . . the system which f. . . d us.' The words, of course, were printed in full. However, I have more respect for this place than to use them like those thugs did. It continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After consumption this can should be crushed and thrown at anyone who represents the system, so please show your support and aim carefully.</PARA>
<PARA>Also on the label was a picture of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) with an axe buried in his head, and it proclaimed, `The best cut of all.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is obscene, juvenile behaviour, authorised by Jennie George, the leader of the ACTU, and, of course, supported by the Australian Labor Party. The violence was deliberate and premeditated. It was un&hyphen;Australian, totally unacceptable and anathema to our democratic process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This action harks back to just prior to the election when Bill Kelty threatened that there would be industrial war if the coalition won. That is typical Labor politics&mdash;ignore the will <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of mainstream Australia. Bill Kelty still has not got over the fact that his remarks in that regard probably delivered an extra couple of percentage points to the coalition parties. Threatening violence as a means to an end seems to be the Labor way. The member for Sydney (Mr Peter Baldwin) well knows those tactics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The thugs involved in the riot came prepared. They had hammers, wheel braces, paint, urine bombs and even syringes full of diluted acid. These weapons are more than harmful; they can be deadly. This vicious premeditated preparation for violence is reprehensible, despicable and totally un&hyphen;Australian.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the premeditation, despite the ugly violence, despite the damage they did to Parliament House, despite the way they crashed the gift shop, and despite injuries the many people protecting this place suffered, the leadership of the ACTU and ALP had to be dragged kicking and screaming to make an apology. No&hyphen;one&mdash;not one person&mdash;in the union movement had the guts to stand up and say that one word, which is still to be heard, which is `sorry'&mdash;sorry to the Australian people, sorry to the Australian Parliament. I have not heard the immediate past president of the ACTU openly condemn Ms George and Mr Kelty for organising this protest. He and all members opposite therefore stand condemned for their silence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The riot was unacceptable. It was inappropriate. It set a terrible example to students who come here to learn about this place, and it deters tourists who visit this place in their droves. It not only degrades those involved in the riot but also degrades our nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had the opportunity of having a student intern from the United States work in my office last year. He telephoned me from New Hampshire the day after the riot, and he said that it was the lead news on all the bulletins in the United States, when normally you hear not a breath of news about our country. So the actions of those protesters brought disrepute to our nation, and they stand condemned for those actions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This place where we stand now is not ours. It is not the union movement's. It does not <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4282"> belong to the Liberal Party, the Labor Party or the National Party. It is owned by each and every Australian. It is their symbol of the nation's freedom and democracy. Yet, on 19 August this year, the union protesters violently stormed this place destroying what they could get their hands on, attacking Parliament House, attacking Federal Police officers and showing utter contempt for property in the ownership of every Australian. They would not do this in their own homes, yet they did it here because this place belongs to Australia and all Australians. Therefore, it is tantamount to the wrecking their own homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This motion would not be complete without commendation for the Parliament House security staff and the Australian Federal Police. Their actions, in the face of the riot, were heroic. They were both physically and verbally abused, attacked with cans and rocks&mdash;and we know there were other weapons on hand&mdash;and forced to hold together the doors at the front entrance while they were being smashed in with a trolley. Through all this they kept at it, courageously defending this place. Over 100 police were injured as a result of the riot, and I place my thanks on the record for their efforts, for putting their bodies on the line and for defending this great democracy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is not just the physical damage the unions caused to this place. There is not just the reputation of our nation which they damaged. There is also a damages bill which is owing, which those responsible must be forced to pay. The House knows that a $91,000 bill has been sent to the ACTU for damages, including stock allegedly stolen from the gift shop. This is the minimum that should be done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that some people have been charged over the riot and, hopefully, everyone responsible will be taken to task over it, but those responsible for the damage&mdash;and the buck has to stop with the ACTU&mdash;must pay for the damage on top of any judicial sentence handed out to any person. This burden should not be placed on the shoulders of the Australian taxpayer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nineteen August was a very black day for our democracy. I should also mention in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> passing that one of those involved in the incitement out the front was the Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Kernot). I normally do not like referring much to the Leader of the Australian Democrats, seeing as she represents such a small proportion of Australian society. As others have said about the Democrats in answer to a question I asked some years ago, there is one thing about them: they cannot be bought, but they can be rented by the hour. That is the way they continue to operate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that an Australian toy manufacturing company could make a fortune if it developed a Cheryl Kernot doll with a shock of blonde hair and, every time you pointed a camera or a microphone towards it, it would start whingeing. This woman has turned whingeing into an art form. She did precisely that when she also was guilty at the front of inciting riots on 19 August. She also should be ashamed of herself. She is irrelevant. The Leader of the Opposition, despite what some of his shadow ministers may think, is not irrelevant. That is why I am so ashamed of his actions on that day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That black day for the democracy of Australia, 19 August, was a sad reflection on the ACTU and the Australian Labor Party, who are ultimately responsible for what occurred. We do not want excuses from those opposite. We do not want more blame. We do not want a defence. We do not want more hatred. We simply want an apology from them. All they have to say to the Australian people and to the Australian parliament is sorry. All we need is a repudiation from them of the actions of the union movement and the intemperate language of the Leader of the Opposition, which, as I have said, I believe incited or led to the incitement of that riot. They can do that, they can start the reconciliation process by saying sorry and by supporting this motion, which I commend to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are four points I want to make in opening and in the time available to respond <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4283"> to this motion. Firstly, this motion is just another part of the continuing, very cynical attempt by the government to extract every ounce of political advantage from the very unfortunate events of 19 August. I have to say, though, the motion is better in its wording than the comments that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) has been making and the rhetoric he has used until now, and I will come back to that in a moment. I welcome that one improvement, although it was not reflected in the speech of the member for Stirling (Mr Eoin Cameron).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, I believe everybody in this House would deplore the actions of that small minority who broke into the House on 19 August. Thirdly, my colleagues and I have recognised, continue to recognise and commend the work of the police and the security staff, most of whom also are good trade unionists, for the manner in which they discharged their duties on that day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fourthly, the motion as moved has deliberately ignored three other key elements of the events of 19 August. Firstly, it deliberately ignores the fact that 30,000 men and women, the largest demonstration ever, came to Canberra to protest peacefully and did protest peacefully, as was the intention of the organisers, and reflected the intention of the organisers in their good behaviour and their responsible discharge of their democratic right to protest before their parliament and to their government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The impact of the good work of those citizens was ruined by the irresponsible behaviour of that minority, but their effort, their concern, the concern that was reflected on that day by those 30,000 law-abiding citizens, should not be forgotten or disparaged by people who seek, as the member for Stirling did, to say the protest itself was un&hyphen;Australian when in fact the protest was a great reflection of a fine Australian tradition of the right to demonstrate. The fact that a small number abused that right does not cut across the proper behaviour and the responsible expression of concern by 30,000 Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second thing the motion conveniently forgets to address is the fact that it was the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> actions of this government that led to 30,000 Australians choosing to come to Canberra and thousands of others demonstrating in Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, Townsville, Cairns and other regional centres. They were concerned about falling job security and about falling security of their wages and working conditions, particularly caused by the workplace relations bill on that day, and other related activities of this government. They were concerned about the conscious decision of this government to tear up the cooperative industrial relations model, which has meant an increase in the level of industrial disputes in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The one thing that is better in this motion than the rhetoric up to now of the government and, in particular, of Mr Reith is the way in which it deals with the question of damages. It is more responsible than the way Mr Reith has spoken. It is more responsible than the actions of the Speaker and the President. The motion says that the courts should consider the issue of damages in dealing with those found by the courts to be responsible for the damage. That is a very appropriate proposal. I wish the government would acknowledge it. It is a great pity that the mover of the motion, in speaking to it, did not reflect similar views.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me consider each of the points I have made in the detail I can in the limited time available to me. Firstly, there is the government's cynical attempt to manipulate this issue. The Minister for Industrial Relations, in particular, has been trying desperately to continue the debate on this matter whilst deflecting attention from the real issue which is affecting millions of Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue affecting the lives and futures of millions of Australians is not who was responsible for the demonstration. That is properly now before the courts and I hope that they take due action&mdash;although we must all be careful about what we say now that various people have been charged. The issue affecting millions of Australians is what is going to happen to their wages and their working conditions, the threat that they are under and the insecurity that they are feeling. The government wishes to divert attention from that by continually coming back to the incident rather than to the cause.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4284">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the responsibility of the Minister for Industrial Relations is to improve industrial relations in this country, not to continue a concerted campaign intended to make&mdash;and with the only possible consequence of making&mdash;it worse. So that is all I have time to say about that cynical attempt, but it is important background against which everything else needs to be judged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that everybody in this House would deplore the actions of that small minority. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) on the day, 19 August, condemned their activity and said that violence has no place in a democracy. There is no question that there are those of us who campaign very hard for the right of people to demonstrate. Sometimes when governments in Western Australia of a conservative persuasion tried to make it illegal, there were those of us who sought very hard to defend that right&mdash;but we have never valued the fact that that right should spill over into violence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, we should recognise the good work of the staff of the Parliament House and the AFP. The cruel irony is, of course&mdash;and it was made very effectively by the local secretary of the AFP Association on that night&mdash;that many of the people doing their duty defending the parliament shared the views of the 30,000 law abiding demonstrators and their concern about the workplace relations bill. Those perpetrating the violence against those officers should have given that some consideration, as well as the fundamental question that everybody has a right to go about their lawful duty without being confronted with violence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the key issue is that the action of that minority overshadowed the serious concern of the majority. The display of that concern on that day is a very important thing for the Australian people to remember and for the government to remember.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> There were 30,000 people here; there were demonstrations in Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, Townsville, Cairns, and other places. There were more than 50,000 people overall concerned about the attack on the role of the Industrial Relations Commission and the reduction in its capacity to protect the inter ests of the weak and the vulnerable&mdash;and not just the particularly weak and the particularly vulnerable, but of ordinary Australian men and women in their workplace concerned about their wages and their working conditions; concerned about the fact that their award system is no longer going to guarantee secure and relevant rates of pay and working conditions but are going to be reduced to a small number of minimum standards; and concerned that they may find themselves over the next 18 months having to negotiate a new agreement merely to preserve their existing benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a very real concern that is affecting millions of Australians in workplaces all around the country, and the parliament should be giving it serious and weighty consideration. Certainly, there are many people speaking to me as I go to workplaces around the country seriously concerned about the reduction in their rights as individuals to organise in their workplace with other workers, to get access to the officials of their union, to get access to the award system and the Industrial Relations Commission to protect their rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are living in a society where insecurity is being heightened by the policies and actions of the government; where workers are finding themselves being faced with increasing pressure for change; where they are apprehensive about their job, apprehensive about what is going to happen to the nature of their job and apprehensive about their wages and working conditions. That is the great issue facing Australian working people today, and it is very important that the parliament does not lose sight of that. When we properly turn our attention to condemning the actions of a minority, we must not lose sight of the rights of the majority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I would just respond to three points that the member for Stirling made in moving his motion. Firstly, there was his insidious attempt to blame the Leader of the Opposition's speech for events which had concluded before the Leader of the Opposition spoke. In fact, he acknowledged that fact in his speech, and then went on to say exactly the opposite in either a mistake or a deliberate attempt to mislead.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4285">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, he said that the protest itself was un&hyphen;Australian&mdash;and I deplore that. It reflects a concern about the legitimate right of Australians to protest. The behaviour of a minority was wrong and deserves to be deplored by everybody in this place. But in responding to that minority, we should not attack the rights of the majority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, I reject the proposal that the protest overall was deliberately intended to be violent. The organisers of that proposal and all involved with it set out, in cooperation with the AFP, to prevent that taking place. We all deplore that they failed. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The afternoon of Monday, 19 August saw what was probably the most sickening event that Parliament House has ever witnessed when a trade union demonstration got out of control. For 2&half; hours some hundreds of half&hyphen;crazed unionists attacked police and parliamentary staff in a most terrifying and disgusting manner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Previous speakers have said that it was the largest rally ever held here. However, I doubt whether there were more than 15,000 there. I well remember in the mid-1980s the farmers rally&mdash;a peaceful rally, I might add&mdash;in which there were 50,000 people here. While it is true that it was a minority that broke away from the main rally and attacked Parliament House, they were not such a small minority. Some newspaper reports said that there were up to 4,000 people involved. I certainly saw several hundreds, and I was there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was the ugliest incident I have ever seen. I stood for over an hour inside Parliament House watching it occur, most of it at the base of the steps in the middle of the marble hall. I was watching these people waving the red union banners of the CFMEU, waving the placards of the AMWU and handing out literature from the MUA, the old wharfies' party, and other unions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well as the people at the door, there were people up on top of Parliament House. I think it epitomised the mentality of this breakaway group that they put a metal hand over the coat of arms of Australia giving the finger, as it was said, bearing the word `maggots' sticking out from that.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the doorway where they were chanting to get in it was a scary experience. There was this primitive guttural chanting all the time. They had torn down earlier the three&hyphen;meter brass stanchion from the doorway and used it as a battering ram to smash through one of the doors. They were hell&hyphen;bent on destruction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The police were absolutely magnificent. I stood there and watched about 20 or 30 police treated in the course of the hour I was there. They were dragged back from the front line to receive medical attention. Some had green dye splattered across their faces and some had had urine and acid thrown at them. It was just a miracle, I guess, that no-one was blinded in at least one eye.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They got down one policewoman early in the piece and with great courage they kicked her as hard as they could, breaking her ribs. They were kicking her everywhere on her body from the head down, including many sensitive parts. It was only the courage of police, who put their own lives at risk and dragged her away, that saved her from far worse serious injury.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They smashed into the people's shop. A sledgehammer was used to knock the door down. It was, obviously, totally premeditated. They had a crowbar and tyre levers. They tipped green dye over everything because it is more damaging than paint. It actually soaks into the timbers. They stole a whole lot of stuff in the shop. I saw a whole pile of empty cases which had contained $199 watches.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They smashed their way up into the ceiling through the Parliament House shop. When I asked why they tried to do that, I was told that, apparently, they were trying to get to the electronic system to turn on the sprinkler system to cause damage throughout the whole of Parliament House, including to the artworks in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This went on for 2&half; hours. Not once did I hear the leadership down the front call for it to be called off. While it is legitimate in this country to demonstrate&mdash;and may that always be the case&mdash;the demonstration of trade unionists here was called, I believe, on false pretences. I think it had more to do with saving some face for the ALP rather than demonstrating for genuine worker benefits. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4286"> They were telling the people that collective bargaining will not be allowed and holiday pay will be abolished and all this sort of nonsense if the workplace agreements bill goes through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They were whipped into a frenzy by Jennie George and Bill Kelty. An earlier speaker spoke of Kim Beazley's hate speech. That is not characteristic of Kim Beazley, a fine individual in many ways. I am sure he regrets the speech that he made. But to hear Bill Kelty afterwards say that this was the most successful rally in the history of this country!&mdash;it was a ridiculous statement, if ever I have heard one. After the rally was over, I went around and gathered up some of the literature that was handed out. I wish I had time to speak of it. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Stirling (Mr Eoin Cameron), who introduced this motion, talked about a terrible example for students. Quite frankly, this contribution of smear, slander and guilt by association is a far worse example for the students of this country. We have a situation where there was an attempt to say that the ACTU deliberately instigated the violence, that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) in criticising this government's policies used intemperate language and thus precipitated violence, and that it was essentially organised from the beginning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not the politics of rational debate. It is not the politics of analysis. It is the politics of McCarthyism. It is the politics of the Zinoviev letter. It is the politics of Vyshinski and the Moscow trials. It is an attempt essentially to denigrate those people who oppose the policies of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth putting this outburst in the context of a comment from their side of politics by the leader of the government in this territory, Kate Carnell, on 20 August this year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The thousands of Canberrans who turned out at today's protest should feel betrayed by the small group of mostly interstate demonstrators who resorted to such violence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nobody disputes the rights of all Australians to protest. The behaviour of some protesters today <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> showed little regard for the way protests are managed by their organisers.</PARA>
<PARA>What she was fundamentally recognising was the reality that this situation was created by an extremely small group of people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to put on the record the comments by many other residents of this territory. Many of them deplored the violence, but at the same time made comments. For instance, G. O'Brien in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They are a disgusting minority who should be arrested, charged and made to pay for the damage. However, I am equally disgusted by Howard and his actions. All he has done is to play on this anarchy, much to his discredit. I am also very angry at the media, which has grossly misrepresented the vast majority who were protesting peacefully and honestly.</PARA>
<PARA>Warwick Doors commented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let us not condone this behaviour but remember that there was a well&hyphen;organised peaceful protest going on at the same time.</PARA>
<PARA>Rob Sharp of Watson, ACT, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I agree wholeheartedly with Peter Reith and John Howard&mdash;there is no place for violence. However, the Coalition lied to us. It lied about almost everything in promising not to break any promises whatever the extent of the protected deficit, John Howard doubled the lie.</PARA>
<PARA>The situation is that these people today who seek to undermine people's rights to assemble are the same people who in the Vietnam War period said to run down people who were opposed to their policies. They are the same people who today are restricting the rights of parliamentary committees to supervise and to analyse their practices. They are the same people who are cutting down the findings towards that body. They are the same people that abolish local government for people in Victoria and essentially have put in managers and dictated contracting out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a situation where, rather than attempt to undermine people's right to free assembly, they should have some recognition of the comments of Beth Gaze and Melinda Jones in a book put out by the Law Book Company entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Law, liberty and Australian democracy</EMPHASIS>.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For some months now in this place I have been raising my concerns about the imminent decision by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) to allow cooked chicken meat to be imported into this country. There are two basic objections here: the first is the massive job losses that would flow from any such decision, and the second is the real threat of the dreaded Newcastle disease being introduced into our nation. In this country the industry is worth some $1.7 billion and employs 16,000 people. In the Hunter Valley it is worth some $70 million. It employs more than 2,000 people directly and many more indirectly.</PARA></TALK.START>

A by&hyphen;election is being held because the former member for Lindsay was too slack to fill in a nomination correctly and because the Liberal Party did not even think she would win, so no&hyphen;one ever bothered checking it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It just gives me time to draw my breath. We always enjoy that. I have seen claims recently in the press and in media releases about so-called windfalls from Telstra profit. It should be clear to this House that Telstra does not pay the whole of its profit to the government. It pays a dividend. The <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> dividend that it will be paying in the 1996-97 year&mdash;and remember it is paid over a number of years; there has already been a prepayment in respect of some it&mdash;will be of the order of about $1.37 billion. The budget is predicated on a dividend payment of the order of $1.3 billion. So the so-called $400 million windfall does not arise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Cheryl Kernot said in a press release embargoed until Sunday, September 16 that there was another $440 million windfall because Telstra had a 76 per cent rise in company tax payments, 10 times larger than the 7.9 per cent allowed in the budget. There is no amount allowed for Telstra's company tax payments in the budget. We have a global figure for company tax collections generally. Telstra may have a higher than expected profit, but other companies will have a lower one. BHP might have a lower one. Other manufacturers might. You have a global figure. That error may well be expected from Senator Kernot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This morning the shadow Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member opposite, came out to parrot the views of Senator Kernot, the real leader in matters like this. He said exactly the same thing&mdash;that there had been a windfall profit which ought to go into the Natural Heritage Trust, exactly what Senator Kernot had said yesterday. If we want the original we will take it from Senator Kernot, thank you very much. We do not need the Labor Party to echo the errors that the Australian Democrats make in this response.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of the financial position that the profligate, wasteful, slothful Labor Party left this country in, if one were to get an extra $70 million in dividend in the 1996-97 year what difference would it make to the underlying line?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am realistic enough to recognise the point made by the Leader of the Opposition that trade with Asia is a very competitive situation. What has been added to the burden is the result of Labor policies, where we have been unable to keep up with the rest of the world in diversifying our export base and remain truly internationally competitive. East Asia's imports of manufactures have shown the most rapid growth but Australia's exports to East Asia are dominated by primary products. Under Labor, there was little incentive for the Australian economy to adjust to the changing nature of demand in East Asia. They made a lot of noise about engagement with Asia. We are getting on with the job of delivering on a full&hyphen;on engagement with Asia.</PARA></TALK.START>

Last week's employment and unemployment figures show just how serious is the legacy bequeathed to Australia by the Labor Party. The tragic failure of Working Nation and its targets show that shonky targets do not create jobs. The fact is that the Labor Party set a whole range of targets in Working Nation and missed them one after the other. They set a target to reduce the number of people unemployed for 18 months or more under the job compact by 47 per cent. They did not get anywhere near that target despite the enormous effort that went into redefining the long-term unemployed as short-term unemployed.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address my question to the Minister for Administrative Services. Has the minister seen the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>  today which claims that ministerial staff jobs are on the increase, at least in the Prime Minister's office, as compared to the previous government? Can the minister comment on the factual situation?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="4299" SPEAKER="Jull, David, MP" NAMEID="MH4" ELECTORATE="Fadden" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Administrative Services" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MH4">Mr JULL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did see Laura Tingle's article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>  today. Probably the most important point that she made was that total ministerial staff numbers are down significantly compared to the previous government. In fact, numbers are down by 19 per cent. There are 295 staff allocated to this government compared to the previous government's approved establishment of 364 positions. That is a saving of 69 positions. Cuts to both government and opposition staff members will deliver savings of $4.075 million per annum in direct salary and related costs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps I could give an example of what has happened under this government. If we look at the defence portfolio over the period from August 1994 to the present we can see that Minister Ray had 10 staff plus one DLO. His assistant, Mr Punch, had seven staff plus one DLO. In August 1994 the intellectual debate had to be lifted somewhat in the defence portfolio and my friend the member for Brisbane was introduced as a parliamentary secretary. He had a staff of two plus one DLO. If we compare this with today's situation, Mr McLachlan, the senior minister, has a total of 10 staff&mdash;that is, eight ministerial and two DLOs&mdash;and Mrs Bishop, the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel has six ministerial staff and one DLO. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well as reductions in staff to individual ministers, the government has also achieved savings by abolishing Labor's National Media Liaison Service, by abolishing Labor's Ministerial Media Group and by abolishing ministerial consultants, with the exception of just one position with the Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cuts to consultants&mdash;I know that the opposition is interested in the whole area of consultants&mdash;represent a saving on establishment of 39 positions compared to the previous government. Ms Tingle also referred to the government's use of departmental liaison officers. Her conclusions in this area are somewhat suspect in as much as the allocated number of departmental liaison officers is the same as under the previous government. Under this government DLOs form a higher proportion of ministerial staffing positions only because total staff members have been reduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, in relation to the Prime Minister's office, I would like to point out that, including DLOs, the Prime Minister currently has 33 staff in his office compared to Mr Keating's 33 staff. There are also three staff in the cabinet policy unit located in the Prime Minister's department.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0J4">Mr RUDDOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The questioner has asked whether or not I have seen comments in newspaper articles about limitations relating to the family reunion portion of the migration program. I have seen the articles. They were based upon an item that was published in a journal called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">People and place</EMPHASIS> . It dealt with <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a large number of issues relating to the management of the migration program. I have to say that the articles seem to be quite well researched because they reflect some of the underlying concerns that I have about the migration program. I would like to remind the House of those concerns.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that, after a number of years in which the preferential number of families has been in the order of 36,000 to 37,000, last year the number rose to almost 50,000. That was a very significant increase, and it came about largely because the number of people entering Australia as either a spouse or de facto partner of an Australian resident or citizen rose by almost 33 per cent&mdash;from 21,000 to 27,790. If you added the number of fiancees, it took it to about 33,000. If you look at that as a total of the migration program that has been announced for this year, it would be almost half of the total migration program based upon people entering Australia on the basis of such relationships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The preferential family category also includes preferential places for parents. The number there rose from 5,000 to almost 9,000&mdash;an increase of 74 per cent&mdash;in one year. The measures that the government announced in the migration program for this year included a number of very important changes to deal with this very significant change that has occurred. It is a change that we believe reflects some underlying problems concerning the basis upon which some people might be entering Australia through the migration program, particularly through the spouse categories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that many of my colleagues have had complaints, as I have, from people who find that after they have sponsored a partner into Australia they leave them almost immediately that they have been granted permanent residency. The former government made changes dealing with applications onshore. They included the introduction of a temporary entry permit only for those who were granted residency status onshore. This saw a reduction between 1991 and 1994 from 9,000 to 4,500 in the number of people applying on that basis. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4301">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you know anything about what has been happening in the migration area, it would be clear that there are very significant problems with that part of the program which need to be addressed. It is going to be important that all of the measures that the government has announced be implemented, because it will be very difficult to administer the program that we have announced unless all of those measures are adopted by the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was unfortunate that last week the opposition saw fit to foreshadow, by the way in which it dealt with a matter in the Senate, that it was going to micro plan the migration program. This will be a very new approach to migration in this country. I was involved in the settling of arrangements with former Minister Ray whereby the migration program would be managed, and it was agreed that the government of the day ought to have been able to determine the migration program without an attempt by the parliament to micro manage the individual sections of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very clear that if the opposition persists with the view that it can micro manage the program and knock off individual parts of the regulations or the statutory changes that we propose, it will be necessary for the government to use the capping powers that are available under the act in relation to spouses and dependent parents. Let it be understood that using those capping powers is a much more draconian and less desirable way of planning the immigration program than acceding to the measures that we have announced and seek to put in place.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

All ministers on the Agriculture and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand&mdash;ARMCANZ, as it is now known&mdash;have given their approval for a nationally coordinated release of rabbit <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> calicivirus disease.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The conclusion of the BRS&mdash;the Bureau of Resource Sciences&mdash;which has reported to me on the virus, is that it is specific to that great pest in this country: the European rabbit. It is safe to other animals and to humans. The benefits to agriculture and to the environment are potentially enormous in this country. In fact, on Friday at PMSEC&mdash;the Prime Minister's Science and Engineering Council&mdash;we were reminded by one expert, again, of the possibility that it is worth up to $600 million a year to agriculture in Australia. That is a shot in the arm that is desperately needed not just for farmers but for the local economies and the regions in which they live and contribute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is in the hands of the state governments from this point on to proceed with a nationally coordinated release. Some 280 sites have been targeted initially and there will be extensive backup, monitoring and surveillance programs to go with it. The agent RCD itself is now in commercial production and sufficient quantities for the release will be available at the beginning of October. The final hurdle, which is registration by the NRA&mdash;the National Registration Authority&mdash;for ag and vet chemicals, will be cleared in the next couple of days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to note that landowners and land managers have a key role, indeed a pivotal role, in ensuring that we maximise the effectiveness of RCD.

It says this: at the start of the federal Labor government's period of office 13 years ago, Telstra employed some 250 people at Roma in Queensland; at the end of the federal Labor government's period of office early this year, that figure was down to just 50.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Has the Treasurer seen comments that the government's opting&hyphen;out policy in relation to the superannuation guarantee levy for low income earning Australians will be to their detriment, and are these comments correct?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="4304" SPEAKER="Costello, Peter, MP" NAMEID="CT4" ELECTORATE="Higgins" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Treasurer" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government's policy in relation to superannuation is to facilitate choice, and to facilitate that choice in relation to the identity of the fund&mdash;and, indeed, in relation to contributions for those who are low wage earners. In the budget the government announced that the threshold for <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the super guarantee charge would reduce to $450 per month from the current $900 per month. That contribution, the six per cent employer contribution on those wages, is forgone income.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the government made clear is that it would allow employees earning down to $450 per month the option to take that as salary rather than have the six per cent under the super guarantee applied into superannuation funds. That is because for low income earners, people on that kind of level, frequently the demands of the day and the need to have income in their hands to attend to the bills of the day are far more important than putting away small sums of money which will not earn them a decent retirement sum in any event. If somebody were on that level of wages and having the super guarantee deducted, the best they could hope for over the term of their working life would be the development of a fund which would probably affect their pension entitlement but not produce for them a sum which they could retire on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I noticed that this claim was put out by Senator Sherry in the context of a far larger claim&mdash;a claim that he put out that the surcharge for high income earners in relation to superannuation announced by the government was a betrayal. I predict that in relation to this matter, as in relation to high income earners and the Medicare levy, the Labor Party will not have the decency to come out and say that they oppose these measures. They are, however, actively engaging in a campaign to delay and frustrate them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party would not be honest enough with electors in places like Lindsay to say that they are against evening out the tax concession on superannuation. Yet they will try to raise as many technical problems as they can in an effort to delay, frustrate and, if possible, defeat the introduction of that measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last Thursday we were treated to a statement by the Leader of the Opposition, who rose to the dispatch box during question time and said, `We are going to support this proposition.' That is what he said in relation to superannuation&mdash;`We are going to support this proposition.' The very next day Senator <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4305"> Sherry came out and said, `This is a betrayal. We are going to refer it to a Senate select committee and we will seek a report by November'&mdash;in other words, an attempt to delay, frustrate and, if at all possible, defeat this measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have former Labor minister Susan Ryan on behalf of the funds running around Australia trying to raise technical difficulties and trying to instruct this opposition on where to go. We have an opposition which is deliberately trying to obfuscate. We have a Leader of the Opposition who will stand in this House and say he supports the measure, yet he will have his own frontbench actively engaged in delay and frustration. That is because this Leader of the Opposition cannot control his frontbench. He cannot get them to vote for this measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proof is in the pudding. If they really agreed with this measure, why was it not done in 13 years of government? It was not done in 13 years of government because Labor in government were all too willing to ensure that high tax concessions went to high income earners and all too willing in government to make sure high income earners did not take out private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now that they are embarrassed by the way they deserted the people of Lindsay and by the way they deserted the ordinary, decent taxpayer they have come out with this meek and mild, `We support the principle.' But every action they take belies their real position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an opposition that is squirming, ducking, weaving, thinking of every procedural mechanism it can to try to defeat this government's measure. This is the government that had the courage to stand up and take the right decisions and this is the government that will lead economic recovery for Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is unfortunate that I have to speak today to this motion moved by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton). One would have thought that, 22 years after the invasion of Cyprus by the Turkish army, the solution to the problem would have been found by now. But 22 years on, we still see 37 per cent of the northern part of the island occupied by that foreign force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More specifically, this motion has been prompted by the murder of two young Cypriots last month. On 11 August we witnessed the graphic and distressing sight of Anastasios Isaak being clubbed to death in the buffer zone. It was a brutal killing&mdash;one which I am sure shocked all those who saw it on television and all those who saw photos of it in the newspapers. Three days later, his cousin Solomos Solomou was shot while climbing a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> flagpole in the buffer zone. The UN report on these killings has described the use of force as `unwarranted and inexcusable'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth noting before this parliament that the Australian Federal Police were, once again, present in the buffer zone on those days. Indeed, they have been there, doing a great job representing this country, since 1963. One of the Australian Federal Police present was standing next to a British soldier who was one of those shot when the Turkish forces shot indiscriminately into the crowd on 14 August.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think, however, we need to look beyond just the individual issues, because it is very clear from the comments by the Turkish forces and by some of the Turkish Cypriot forces in the post August 14 environment that there was a political motivation to these killings. It was designed to show that Cyprus is an intercommunal dispute, that Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots simply cannot get on. UN reports have highlighted that a right&hyphen;wing terrorist organisation, the Grey Wolves, was paid to come from Turkey into Cyprus to cause trouble. I think that organisation should be condemned, as should all international terrorist organisations. The reality is that we have seen not an intercommunal dispute but two citizens murdered in their own country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">United Nations resolutions have been ignored for 22 years. How long must Cyprus wait for justice? I say it is time for peace. It is time for all foreign troops to leave Cyprus. There are currently 35,000 Turkish troops in the northern part of the island which they occupy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is time that the relatives of the 1,619 missing persons from 1974 were told what happened to those people. It is time that Cypriot citizens were allowed freedom of movement in their own country. It is time that they were allowed to return to their homes. It is time that ghost cities, such as Famagusta, were returned to their old splendour, to the great cities that they once were.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the proposal for demilitarisation is a particularly attractive one and one which should attract the support of all those who would like to see a peaceful settlement. We <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4314"> need to ensure that there is security for both Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots as part of any solution. I am pleased that this motion before the House today refers to United Nations resolution 939 of 1994, because that would be a solution based upon a sovereign, independent and unified Cyprus comprised of a bi&hyphen;communal and bi&hyphen;zonal federal republic. Most importantly, it would be a sovereign state. But the international community must step up the pressure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Cypriot government must look at other international questions with some despair. This parliament supported the UN action against Iraq when it invaded Kuwait. We have also recently seen the United States intervene to implement no&hyphen;fly zones&mdash;not in their country, but in Iraq against Iraqi planes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The world has quite rightly condemned ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia. But ethnic cleansing occurred in Cyprus in 1974 when 150,000 Greek Cypriots were expelled. At the time, however, the United States supported Turkey and the Greek junta due to its perception of the need to have a friend to the south of the then Soviet Union. That excuse cannot be given any more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what is the future? I think there needs to be real negotiation between the leadership of the Greek and the Turkish Cypriots. I believe that Cyprus's application to become a member of the European Union is a very positive move. It would enable Cyprus to enter the European Community as a full partner, not limiting its function to talks about trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we in Australia have an obligation&mdash;not just because we have Federal Police in Cyprus and not just because we have a number of people of both Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot origin living in Australia but, most importantly, and in spite of some of the recent criticisms, because Australia survives as a multi&hyphen;ethnic culture in a way which lets all citizens benefit from that diversity and from that respect of different cultures. If an electorate such as mine of Grayndler in Sydney can have Greek Cypriots, Turkish Cypriots and more than 100 ethnic groups cooperating and living together, then it should not be too much to suggest that a united Cyprus, in which Greek Cypriots and Turkish <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Cypriots work together in order to benefit the whole nation, should occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What it needs is goodwill, and what concerns me is the fact that the Ankara government appears to have shown little goodwill in negotiating on the basis of good faith. Until that occurs, it is hard to see a solution coming to this issue without international pressure. I commend the motion to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to support the motion moved by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton). I think it is a good motion, with some reservations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The motion follows hard on the heels of the one supported by the parliament in November last year, which was also an important motion. The fact that this motion does follow so hard on the heels of November's motion within the parliament actually enhances its significance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This motion demonstrates a refusal to be overcome by a sense of futility when contemplating recent events&mdash;the tragic litany of the violation of Cyprus. The Turkish invasion of the island. The killing and the disappearance of almost 7,000 Greek Cypriots. The unlawful secession of the illegal northern regime. The 200,000 Greek Cypriots dispossessed of their homes and property. The 35,000-strong Turkish army of occupation. The emigration of tens of thousands of Turkish Cypriots, the very people whose position within Cyprus was purported to be secured by the invasion. The influx of tens of thousands of colonists from the Turkish mainland. The accelerating arms race on an island that is already a military tinderbox, an island which constitutes one of the most heavily militarised regions in the world. The endless procession of United Nations Security Council resolutions over the years, passed but not implemented. Were we to become desensitised to the facts about continuing violations and injustices, we would be contributing to their perpetuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last month's violence, the worst since 1974's invasion, involved the brutal, deplorable killings by the Turkish forces of two young Greek Cypriot men&mdash;one clubbed to death while entangled in barbed wire, the other shot to death while clambering up a flag <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4315"> pole. They cannot be glossed over just because they are the latest chapter in almost a quarter of a century of repression, repression that has been going on since 1974.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The motion does underscore the fact that the Australian parliament has an ongoing commitment to a just solution in Cyprus and the Australian parliament will respond to new developments by affirming and reinforcing the bipartisan policy that has been held by successive Australian governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The motion is, I believe, also valuable because it is rather more robust than the one debated last November. It explicitly and deliberately recognises that there has been a Turkish invasion of the island and that Turkey occupies Cyprus. It is worth while recollecting that when I noted the omission of such references in the November motion the honourable members for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay), Melbourne (Mr Tanner) and Charlton (Mr Robert Brown)&mdash;whose commitment to a just solution in Cyprus is unquestioned&mdash;decided to take umbrage and tried to assert that avoiding any mention of Turkey somehow increased the efficacy of the motion. Indeed, the member for Charlton went so far as to say that by raising this matter I had introduced what he called an `inappropriate note of partisanship'. There was some agitation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased that this motion does name Turkey, and its doing so makes the motion neither inappropriate nor partisan. I believe that the substance of this motion is enhanced because it engages not in misplaced attempts at diplomatic politeness but in something substantive. After all, the House of Representatives is not a diplomatic garden party. We are not negotiating a communique and we can be plain spoken about the things that are clear to all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The fact is that the Cyprus issue, for all the lack of progress in achieving a resolution after 22 years and for all the frustrated efforts at reaching an effective compromise, is one of the few international issues&mdash;in my view, at least&mdash;on which there is a fundamental and overriding international consensus. That consensus revolves around the undeniable fact that it is Turkey that continues to be intransi gent, that continues to make no moves towards compromise and that continues to station an army 35,000 strong within Cyprus which is an army of occupation. I believe that this needs to be said unequivocally in the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia does have a very real interest in the resolution of the Cyprus issue. This interest is based both on our longstanding international concern with just resolution of international disputes and on the recognition that there are significant numbers of Australians of Cypriot origin and both Turkish and Greek descent who have got an interest in such a resolution. It is also partly influenced by the fact that we do recognise that, were the conflict over Cyprus to spill over, the potential for basic instability between Greece and Turkey would be immense. There have been great strains in that relationship which have been manifest since the beginning of this year in particular. Were the pressures and stresses of the conflict in Cyprus to spill over into a much larger relationship, the prospects for conflict would be enormous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has always supported the resolutions of the United Nations and there has always been a bipartisan consensus on this. We have an interest which, as the motion does outline, rests on a withdrawal of Turkish troops, on the sovereignty, territorial integrity and unity of the Republic of Cyprus and on a significant number of other measures, including demilitarisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, these issues have all been addressed by ourselves and by the United Nations. It is my belief that the government of the Republic of Cyprus has taken an appropriate, moderate and conciliatory line on these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key barrier to a fundamental resolution does rest with the Turkish government and I do think it is time that that government reviewed its position. Apart from anything else, the latest round of conflict in Cyprus shows that there is a hardening of positions within Cyprus itself which have never manifested themselves to this degree before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fundamentally, I believe that the motion is a very effective one, but I would be less than frank if I were not to say that the final point <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4316"> of the motion does strike me as being rather elevated in its expectations. To expect, as the motion's final point does, that Australia can take the lead amongst the international community in resolving the Cyprus issue does exaggerate our power. Our contribution to a just resolution of the Cyprus issue depends on realising the limits of our capacity in this area. Otherwise, we will create expectations that we cannot meet and dissipate what influence we have. We should act in multilateral fora and in directly influencing both parties to achieve the just solution that is required after 22 years.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The interesting thing is that this motion on Cyprus follows on from the earlier motion, as the member for Kooyong (Mr Georgiou) has said. The bottom line question is: how many more people have got to die before something is done to try to resolve the 22&hyphen;year dilemma facing not only the people of Cyprus but also those who are associated with it? That includes, of course, those countries that supply peacekeeping police officers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Kooyong mentioned that the ultimate paragraph in the motion may be somewhat highfalutin because it overstates Australia's potential to influence the rest of the world. My view is that Australia could take a more strident stand on this matter. I certainly think it could take a more strident stand than Foreign Minister Downer did at the time of the most recent violence. Certainly I think that the view is shared by a number of federal parliamentarians, including Liberal and Country Liberal members, that the Australian government could in fact upgrade its response from merely concern to taking what most would consider to be the right stand, and that is to call for immediate action not only to stop the violence but also to bring an end to what is an unacceptable situation&mdash;22 years of occupation by Turkish troops of a significant proportion of the sovereign territory of the Republic of Cyprus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> This motion relates specifically to the recent violence on Cyprus where the Turkish occupying forces have killed two young Greek Cypriots and wounded two soldiers of the British troops in the UN peacekeeping for ces&mdash;the subject, obviously, of considerable concern to any peace&hyphen;loving people anywhere in the world. Unfortunately, the tension has been increased by statements such as that of the Turkish Foreign Minister, Mrs Ciller, who said on the weekend of 17 and 18 August that anyone who lays a finger on the Turkish Cypriot flag `will get his hand broken'. That is the sort of inflammatory statement we could do without under these circumstances. It behoves responsible government&mdash;and that includes all governments involved in this affair&mdash;to ensure that debate over this matter is rational and not conducive to more violence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This motion relates to one of the most violent days the island has seen since the Turkish invasion in 1974. Many Cypriots lament the fact that after 22 years still this occupation is being allowed to continue. You only have to look at more recent events in the Balkan region to understand how a continuing tension such as is evident in Cyprus can cause an ignition of feelings so powerful that we could well see things escalate into more substantial conflict than the unfortunate and murderous events that occurred on 11 August and 14 August in Cyprus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is absolutely clear that this chamber should condemn wholeheartedly the barbarity of the disproportionate response by the Turkish forces to the protests made by Greek Cypriots, particularly in relation to the beating of unarmed protesters. It is clear from reading and from other material that there was some attempt to incite a more violent response&mdash;in other words, an attempt to make the situation appear as though the two peoples on the island cannot live in peace with each other, that there cannot be a settlement of anything other than the present division of the island with a no-man's-land in the middle, which most peace&hyphen;loving and reasonable people around the world would consider to be totally unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The barbarity of the attack is self-evident because it is captured on film. The world's television viewers are able in their living rooms to see this young Greek Cypriot being beaten to death on 11 August. This included blows being administered to him by a uniformed man from the Turkish side.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4317">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This action has been strongly condemned by the United Nations but, I might add, not particularly by the Australian government, which is unfortunate. Violence of this nature has the potential to further deepen the already serious rift between Greece and Turkey. We know they have come close to war in the past over ownership of islands in the Aegean. Serious concerns have been expressed by the United States, which is obviously fearful of the potential for a wider conflict between two of its NATO allies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The lack of restraint by Turkey, in my view, has encouraged a mood of defiance and belligerence amongst some of the young men on Cyprus, amongst the Greek Cypriots, which has the potential to blow up again unless Turkey can be forced by international opinion to moderate its actions. Greece and Turkey both have new people in national leadership roles who are obviously keen to solidify their support at home. An escalation of tension from any recurrence of this type of barbaric behaviour could see both sides withdraw to intransigent positions and place the region in jeopardy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government of the Republic of Cyprus is endeavouring to pursue its application to join the European Community. It has a strong level of economic growth, its standard of living is increasing significantly and it is clearly part and parcel of Europe. But, unfortunately, because of the lack of a resolution, because of a lack of will in arriving at a resolution that will work, we have the situation where one part of the island which is not under occupation enjoys a high standard of living with economic growth and buoyant circumstances and the other part of the island, under occupation, suffers a declining standard of living. If and when reunification occurs there is going to be substantial investment required to bring that part of the island to the same standard of living as the area that is controlled by the government of the Republic of Cyprus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is my view that Australians everywhere would consider that it is the right of every citizen of the world to be able to enjoy the benefits of the standard of living created by their own labour and ingenuity. In this case <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> we have a situation where the ingenuity, the hard work, the economic circumstances, the drive in the economy in the Republic of Cyprus is being thwarted by this continuing occupation&mdash;an occupation that has lasted for 22 years, an occupation which apparently sees no end unless we can literally force, through international clamour, the rest of the world to take a more significant interest in arriving at a solution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned earlier that we have debated this matter in the past and it is clear that the overwhelming view in the House of Representatives is for complete opposition to the continuation of the occupation. In particular, Australia supports the relevant UN Security Council resolution 939 of 1994, which calls for a solution to be based upon a sovereign, independent and unified Cyprus comprising a communal and bizonal federal republic free of foreign interference. Those sentiments are of the highest order. We naturally would wish to reiterate those sentiments as they comprise part of the motion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, may I make the following observation. I am aware that President Clerides wrote to the Turkish Cypriot leader, Mr Denktas, on 11 September calling for a meeting to discuss the crucial issue of the divided island's full demilitarisation. Unfortunately, the demilitarisation proposal has been turned down by both the Turkish government and the Turkish Cypriot leader. However, after last month's violence and increased tension, the proposal made in this particular instance by President Clerides will, hopefully, play a vital role towards peace in Cyprus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that our interests and our role in the Cyprus crisis are genuine and sincere. We have had Australian police officers, both from the Australian Federal Police and from state police forces, serve with distinction in Cyprus towards the object of peace and towards providing an opportunity for Cypriots to conduct their affairs in relatively peaceful circumstances. However, we must also at the same time be absolutely clear that we thoroughly condemn the barbarity of the Turkish actions on 11 and 14 August, and we must stridently oppose the continuation of this occupation by Turkish troops of the sovereign <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4318"> territory of the government of the Republic of Cyprus.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in support of this motion and acknowledge the bipartisan support it has received and the ongoing interest members on both sides of this House have shown in the developments in Cyprus. Successive Australian governments have provided police officers from both federal and state forces since 1964 to aid United Nations forces to supervise a 180 kilometre long buffer zone between the Turkish army and Greek Cypriot forces. The current contingent is 20 police&mdash;18 men and two women&mdash;from the Australian Federal Police on a six&hyphen; or 12&hyphen;month tour.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is now some 22 years since Turkish troops invaded Cyprus and first occupied 37 per cent of the island. Today there are still 40,000 Turkish troops occupying the northern end of the island. This action has since divided the Cypriot community and raised questions over human rights violations and the preservation of basic freedoms for the people in Cyprus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst many international efforts, including United Nations resolutions, have been made intending to progress towards a peaceful resolution to the so&hyphen;called Cyprus problem, tensions remain. This was so tragically illustrated by the violent deaths of two unarmed Greek Cypriots in recent, supposedly peaceful demonstrations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian government's position on Cyprus is clear and has been consistently in support of the United Nations resolutions on Cyprus. Resolution 541 of the United Nations Security Council, adopted in 1983, deplores the declaration of the Turkish Cypriot authorities of the purported secession of part of the Republic of Cyprus. It considers the declaration as legally invalid and calls for its withdrawal. It calls upon all states to respect the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and non&hyphen;alignment of the Republic of Cyprus. It also calls upon all states not to recognise any Cypriot state other than that of the Republic of Cyprus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Resolution 550 condemns all secessionist actions, including the purported exchange of ambassadors between Turkey and the Turkish <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Cypriot leadership, and declares them illegal and invalid. It also calls for their immediate withdrawal. In 1991 the United Nations Security Council, in resolution 716, reaffirmed its position on the Cyprus question that the fundamental principles of a Cyprus settlement are the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and non-alignment of the Republic of Cyprus and that there be an exclusion of union in whole or in part with any other country and any form of partition or secession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Upon an invitation from the Cypriot government, I travelled to Nicosia in the week before last with the members for Grayndler (Mr Albanese) and Watson (Mr Leo McLeay). In briefings with President Clerides of the Republic of Cyprus we were encouraged by hearing of the ongoing interest of the United States in working towards a solution to the Cyprus problem. This commitment in principle was confirmed in meetings between Presidents Clinton and Clerides in Washington in June of this year. The European Union has also given undertakings to commence accession negotiations with Cyprus following the conclusion of the current intergovernmental conference. There is optimism in Cyprus that accession would increase security and prosperity and would help bring the two communities of the island closer together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that the problems experienced in Cyprus are complex, but my recent visit has given me a clearer understanding of the issues, even though I felt I had a grasp of them prior to the visit. While in Cyprus we had meetings with President Clerides, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Michaelides, members of the parliament and officials representing all political parties in Cyprus. We also met with the families of some of the missing persons and attended the first session of the 14th meeting of the Central Committees of the World Federation of Overseas Cypriots and the International Coordinating Committee of Justice for Cyprus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from the meetings with official parties, an originally unplanned visit to the headquarters of the Australian Federal Police based at the disused Nicosia international airport and commanded by Barry Carpenter&mdash; <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4319">who is on his fourth tour of duty in Cyprus&mdash;also left the delegation with valuable impressions and first&hyphen;hand information about the recent acts of violence in Cyprus. One of the members of the Australian Federal Police contingent was next to a United Kingdom colleague at the time he was shot when there was indiscriminate shooting into the crowd following the murder of Solomos Solomou.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite recent tensions and the fact that they are unarmed and without riot protection, the members of the Australian Federal Police remain in good spirits and enhance Australia's reputation in Cyprus. An impromptu drive through the old part of Nicosia close to the buffer zone also left an indelible impression: barbed wire fencing, the space of the non&hyphen;combat zone and the inflammatory sight of a huge Turkish flag painted on the rocky face of the distant hills are constant reminders to the residents of Nicosia of the divisions facing their island. Even the most neutral commentators said that the painting of the Turkish flag could be judged only as the most provocative of actions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am particularly indebted to Evi, who was our guide while in Cyprus, and to Dr Paul Toumazos, President of the Cyprus community of South Australia, who was in Cyprus at the time of our visit. I was particularly moved by them recounting stories of their childhood and family experiences prior to 1974. Both Evi and Paul were brought together by our visit but had long ago shared friends in common in the now ghost city of Famagusta.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dr Toumazos came to Australia as a refugee from Cyprus at the age of 20 and is now a valued member of the Adelaide community. He commented during the visit that he had never experienced discrimination in his time in Australia. This is just one small example of Australia's success in pursuing a policy of multiculturalism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With Paul and Evi the delegation visited the demarcation line at Derynia. While travelling to this site we passed by some land which Paul started to say `was' but then corrected himself to say `is our farm'. Experiences like this and later having both Evi and Paul point out where they used to live&mdash;they had to do this through binoculars&mdash;and having felt the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> barbed wire fences, the need for international action was made all the more apparent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At Derynia we observed the flagpole where Solomos Solomou had been so unnecessarily and tragically shot. Reflecting on the incidents of 11 and 14 August, it is worth remembering that Solomos Solomou's actions in trying to take down the Turkish flag occurred following the funeral of his cousin Anastasios Isaak, who had been beaten to death during a demonstration three days earlier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the videos and photos I have seen of the shooting of Solomos Solomou, it was obvious that there were large numbers of United Nations peacekeepers present who, if allowed to, could have controlled the situation without bloodshed. The UN peacekeeping force report on the incident described the use of force by Turkish or Turkish Cypriot military personnel as `totally unwarranted'. President Clerides sees the solution for Cyprus as a demilitarisation of the island and therefore more power to the peacekeeping forces there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was frequently told during meetings that the argument is not with Turkish Cypriots but with the Turkish forces that have artificially partitioned their communities. Concern has also been expressed to me about the many thousands of Turkish Cypriots who have now left the occupied territories of Cyprus and migrated to other parts of the world and who have been replaced by Turkish settlers, changing the ethnic make-up of that part of the island. This will have important implications for any future peace negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two reasons why Australia should remain concerned with developments in Cyprus. Firstly, Australia remains relatively free from the civil strife and injustice witnessed in Cyprus. As an active international citizen it is only natural that we use our influence wherever possible to support actions aimed at a peaceful resolution to the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the large number of Greek and Cypriot migrants who have adopted Australia as their home and have been such good citizens of our country remain committed to Australia, doing all that it can to highlight the ongoing problems of Cyprus in international forums and to consider possible solutions. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4320"> Many members of the Cypriot communities here in Australia have relatives and properties affected by the partitioning of the island. Members would be interested to know that Australia's Cypriot community is the second largest outside of Cyprus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's political system and its cultural values reflect very strongly the enduring legacy that Greece has left to the entire Western world, especially the influence of Greek culture with its emphasis on learning, thought and democratic heritage. It is right that Australia remains concerned for the future of Cyprus. I commend this motion to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like the previous speaker, the honourable member for Adelaide (Ms Worth), has mentioned, I visited Cyprus a few weeks ago with her in the company of the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese). A number of our colleagues, including the member for Northern Territory (Mr Dondas), who will speak after me, had visited the island just prior to that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose for an Australian going from the largest island in the world to Cyprus, which is one of the medium sized islands of the world, you are immediately hit by the fact that here in this country Greek Cypriots, Turkish Cypriots, Greeks and Turks can all live together with each other and in Cyprus Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots are unfortunately being forced to live out a nightmare in their own land. In 1974, the Turkish government, which unfortunately is one of the guarantor powers of the independence of the island of Cyprus, invaded Cyprus and occupied 37 per cent of the northern part of the island.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After those 22 years of partition, we have seen the southern part of Cyprus boom economically and we have seen the northern part of the island stagnate. In the south we have seen the people become determined to take control of the whole of their homeland again. I thought an interesting parallel would be if someone drew a line across the top third of our country and said that I could not visit the member for Northern Territory in Darwin and he could not visit me in Sydney. How would <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> we as Australians think if that were done to us? Nick might think it was a good idea and sometimes I might think it was a good idea if he did not come and see me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are a lucky people in this country in that we have always had that right to go wherever we like in our own country. In Cyprus people have been deprived of that for 22 years. The people who used to live in the city of Famagusta can now go and stand just near the Derynia Gate and look across at a ghost city. The Turks exceeded their own abilities and moved forward too quickly and decided to keep part of that city empty as a bargaining chip with the south, and for 22 years that part of the city has not had anyone living in it. People of Greek Cypriot origin who lived in that part of Famagusta, one of the most ancient cities in the world, are able to stand on a hill and look at their houses but not go near them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People from the city of Kyrenia, many of whom live in my electorate, know what their homeland was like but can go to Cyprus and visit nearly anywhere except their home city. For those people from Kyrenia to not be able to go back to that beautiful city just because they are Greek Cypriots is a terrible thing for them to have to cope with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the worst things both the member for Adelaide and I experienced while we were in Cyprus was the meeting we had with the representatives of the missing persons. Twenty-two years after the invasion, there are still families that do not know what has happened to their brothers and sisters, their uncles and aunts and their sons and daughters who were seized by the Turkish troops&mdash;1,619 are unaccounted for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seemed to us a simple thing, if the Turkish government knew that these people were dead, to just tell the relatives. The worst thing for these families is that they do not know. We talked to one man who had not seen his brother since that day 22 years ago. We talked to a Cypriot orthodox priest who had not seen his son since that day 22 years ago. You got the distinct feeling that in some way those people might have been happier if they had known their relations were dead because they could have at least prayed for them and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4321"> gone through the ceremonies for them. But they do not know and they worry about how they are and whether they are healthy&mdash;that sort of thing. It would be a great act of kindness and generosity on the part of the Turkish government to at least recognise that so the relatives could know whether some of these people were dead or alive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think one of the problems with the Cyprus issue is that you have such hard positions taken on the Turkish side. The example mentioned by the member for Moore (Mr Filing) was of the previous Turkish Prime Minister, now their foreign minister, saying that you should cut off the hand of anyone who touches a Turkish or Turkish Cypriot flag&mdash;at a time when there is considerable tension on the island after one young man has been killed and another young man has been shot in the meantime. These sorts of hard&hyphen;line positions do not allow people to come to a conclusion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Surely after all this time we should be looking for a solution. It is nearly 10 years since the Berlin wall came down and that city is now a beautiful city that all of us can go to and walk through. But you still have the green line, with barbed wire and brick walls, separating the ancient city of Nicosia. You can stand there and look across it, but if you are a Turkish Cypriot or a Greek Cypriot you cannot cross it. That is in the latter part of the 20th century in a country that is a candidate member for the European Union and which is under occupation by a NATO power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not some sort of bizarre little neck of the woods of the world that no-one has known about. This is on Europe's doorstep and the country that is the occupying power is the United States' most slavish ally in that part of the world. They are doing it with the acquiescence of the United States. There are 35,000 troops on the island and 400 tanks&mdash;all equipped with NATO military, all of it transported to the island in 1974 in NATO troop carriers, all of it maintained there out of the NATO budget&mdash;occupying a country that is about to become a member of the European Union.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At this time, when we have democracy sweeping the world, when we have people <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> being able to have self-determination, when we are seeing elections of some sort in the former Yugoslavia, everyone wants to forget Cyprus. No-one wants to remember that for 22 years we have had a country under occupation by a NATO ally. After 22 years, it is long enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important for us as Australians because we are a country where, as I said earlier, Greeks and Turks&mdash;Cypriots of all colours, shapes, sizes and religious affiliations&mdash;can get on with each other. We are a country that should be setting the example. We are a country that said in November last year in a motion before this House that we believed there should be a solution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were one of the first parliaments&mdash;I think the first parliament in the world after the Cyprus parliament&mdash;to call for the demilitarisation of the island. Demilitarisation is a sensible situation when you remember that the UN Secretary-General said that this island, which wants to become part of Europe shortly, is the most heavily militarised area in the world. The Cyprus government spends money on trying to match some of the Turkish hardware and the president of Cyprus in the Cypriot parliament wants that money to be spent developing the northern part of the island. They say, `Let's demilitarise and let's get the country back together again and let's use that money to raise the level of the north of our country.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think this House should support the motion. I think Australians of all political persuasions should support this motion. I think the most important thing for us as Australian politicians is to understand that the problem in Cyprus is not a communal problem. This is not a problem between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots. This is an international problem that the world at an international level has to understand. There is no greater group of supporters of the Turkish Cypriots in northern Cyprus than the Greek Cypriots in southern Cyprus. The great worry they have is that the Turkish Cypriots are voting with their feet. Since the invasion, 25 per cent of them have left the island. It is a disgrace and it should be resolved.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to support the motion presented by the member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton), it certainly is very important to acknowledge that immediately postwar, in 1946-47, a lot of Cypriot Greeks moved to the Northern Territory. Over many years they have played a very important part in the development of the Northern Territory business infrastructure. It is something the Cypriot Greek community in the Northern Territory can be very proud of.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other members have spoken of and condemned the invasion of Cyprus by Turkey in 1974. One of the major problems, I understand from listening to honourable members and also from a briefing by the Cypriot government whilst I was there as part of the delegation representing those persons of Greek origin from Australian parliaments&mdash;there was a delegation from the Australian federal parliament and also from other state parliaments of Australia&mdash;is that there have been so many changes of government, both in Greece and recently in Cyprus. There has been very little stability and this obviously has some effect in terms of resolution of their problem. The change of government certainly has had an impact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A message from the Mayor of Famagusta in January 1995 certainly sums up my feelings towards these problems. I would like to read it into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> because the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth), who has recently been to Cyprus, has brought up several points that I was going to refer to and I do not want to take up the time of the House by going over the same ground. This message from the Mayor of Famagusta in January 1995 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rarely in recent modern history, has a crime against a small and defenceless country like Cyprus, by an army of the force and strength of that of Turkey, been allowed to pass with such impunity. In flagrant violation of international law, Turkish forces have occupied 37% of the Republic of Cyprus since 1974. 200,000 Greek Cypriots abandoned their ancestral homes, businesses and properties in the face of the aggressive Turkish army. When the ethnic cleansing of the northern, occupied area of Cyprus was completed, 80,000 settlers were brought over from Anatolia and were allocated those same properties. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At this time the systematic destruction of the cultural heritage of Cyprus was begun and continues unchallenged today. The United Nations and the Security Council have been unable or unwilling to enforce their own resolutions on Cyprus. The struggle for a better and more just world, for the establishment of freedom and human rights, so often proclaimed by the major world powers, has remained an unfulfilled promise in Cyprus.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the last twenty years the people of Famagusta have only been able to view their town from behind barbed wire. Fundamental human rights including freedom of movement and residence, have been blatantly denied us, by the uncompromising stance of the Turkish occupation army. Famagusta has had a well&hyphen;documented Greek history and civilisation for 36 centuries. Our roots remain in the town of our birth, symbolised by the untended graves of our forebears.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Double standards are prevalent in Cyprus, where the military strong and powerful follow one set of rules and the weaker and defenceless another. We are being forced to accept the occupation and violation of human rights as the reality of foreign aggression. This surely creates a precedent and will bring back the dark days when the more powerful countries invaded and colonised their weaker neighbours. We believe that the struggle for the liberation of Famagusta and the occupied north of Cyprus, adhering strictly to recognised International Law and the Charter of the United Nations, is a struggle for the highest ideals of liberty, justice and democracy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On behalf of the Municipal Council, which represents 60,000 displaced people of Famagusta, I urgently appeal for the return of Famagusta in its entirety to its residents. With the return of the occupying army and the settlers to their own country without further delay, I believe the people of Cyprus can again live in harmony and peace. Twenty years is too long a time to suffer.</PARA>
<PARA>This message was signed by the elected Mayor of Famagusta, Cyprus, Andreas Ch. Pouyouros.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) described the killing of two young Cypriots during the recent demonstrations there. He inferred that the killing was committed by the forces. I have photographs&mdash;no doubt the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) has the same photographs&mdash;which show this young Greek Cypriot being clubbed to death by civilians as well as the Turkish forces who were in that demilitarised zone. I am led to believe that over a thousand of these Turkish people were bussed into the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4323"> demilitarised zone to attend this rally. As I said, I have this photograph. Other members of the chamber are welcome to look at it.</PARA>

In fact, I cannot even see the flag in this photograph that I have here. He is probably only about one-fifth of the way up. I doubt very much whether he would have got to the top of the flagpole to touch the Turkish flag. He was killed by five shots.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Adelaide did mention the fact that one of our Australian Federal Police who was part of the peacekeeping force there happened to be in the vicinity at the time and he was very lucky not to have been shot himself. In fact, he was only standing metres away from the other person who had been shot dead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Things are really bad there. When one goes over to Greece and speaks to the foreign affairs and defence ministers, we know that the situation between Turkey and Greece is not getting any better. As I understand from the briefing we received, on a day by day basis the Turks were infringing on Greek air space. They were sending up their aircraft to deal with the problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are all aware of the historic problems that have existed between the Greek community and the Turkish community over many centuries. It is a pity that these problems still exist in 1996, especially when one considers the history of the Cyprus question over the last 22 years. We are aware that the Cypriot government has made many applications to Turkey through the United Nations to try to resolve the problem. The Cypriot government has put many proposals to the Turkish government for a resolution of the question. They have put commercial questions to the Turks to try to resolve the problems. They have put political problems to the Turks to try to resolve the problems. They have put <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> humane questions to the Turks to try to resolve the problems. Some 22 years later the problems are getting worse when one considers the recent death of these two young Greek Cypriots.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Adelaide was quite right that the reports by the United Nations on the incident in Cyprus described the force used by the Turkish Cypriot military as `totally unwarranted'. When flying back to Australia a week or so ago I heard that a Turkish Cypriot civilian had been killed by somebody from the Cypriot side. So I am quite aware that obviously there is going to be some further development and reprisal by the Turks from this incident. I am hoping that what I heard was only a rumour and not factual.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do support the member for Watson in what he is saying. The Australian government must take a closer look and appraise the situation that exists between Turkey, Greece and Cyprus. I am hoping that we will be successful in our bid to become a member of the United Nations Security Council later this year&mdash;I know that we have made a bid for it&mdash;so that at least Australia will have another voice in trying to help resolve the problem in the Mediterranean.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the issue of the Turks now starting to seek further sovereignty over certain parts of the Aegean is going to bring further conflict between Greece and Turkey. I do support the motion moved by the member for Kingsford-Smith and hope that the motion is passed this afternoon.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I wish to draw the attention of the House to the considerable consternation so far as unemployment and the prospects for growing unemployment in Australia are concerned. Members of the House would be aware of the August 1996 unemployment figures which were out recently.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I quote from the flash forecast by Bankers Trust, dated 12 September&mdash;last week. Under the heading `Market Implications', Bankers Trust says, `Our quick conclusion is that the labour market is still just muddling along.' In the course of the detailed comment on that day, they say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The unemployment rate for males rose from 8.5% to 9.1%, its highest level since last October. The female unemployment rate was steady at 8.4%. Almost all of the rise in  unemployment in the month was accounted for by males. Who'd be a bloke?</PARA>
<PARA>That was the question. I see the parliamentary secretary and the shadow minister taking an interest in that question. In their comment, Bankers Trust say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the moment, it seems best to stick to our long&hyphen;held belief that the labour market is simply stagnating&mdash;getting neither better nor worse.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, we can expect to see figures at least of this proportion in the future. In a more considered piece the following day, Bankers Trust, in their Daily Economic and Financial News, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimate of total employment rose by 37,900 in August, its fifth consecutive increase. This is the first time that employment has risen for five months in a row since October 1994&mdash;February 1995.</PARA>
<PARA>It then goes on to repeat the comments about unemployment and finishes with the conclu <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4325"> sion that: `the pickup in jobs will still leave unemployment close to flat'. That is directly as a result of there not being enough growth in Australia's economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the course of the previous parliament I was fortunate to be a member of the then government's caucus employment task force which was one of the caucus committees involved in the study of employment and long-term unemployment.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="TANNER" NAMEID="YU5">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;An excellent committee.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5V5">Mr STEPHEN SMITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;An excellent committee, I agree with the member for Melbourne. He is actually perking up now&mdash;I draw that to the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Mr Abbott). That caucus committee's work led in part to the Working Nation white paper. I read to the House some of the introductory comments of the Working Nation white paper because it embedded into policy the notion that, if you want to do something about unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment, economic growth is an essential ingredient, but of itself it is not enough. The white paper said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Economic growth is the best way of generating new and worthwhile jobs to meet the needs of an expanding workforce and to make inroads into unemployment. Jobs created by economic growth need no subsidies and contribute to a higher standard of living for all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Economic growth and employment growth thus go together. Sustained growth requires the continuation of low inflation, and the maintenance of our improved competitiveness through higher investment . . . and improved productivity. The more robust economic growth which results will maximise the generation of employment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What is not always well recognised is how inefficient unemployment is. Reducing unemployment is therefore an essential part of getting the economy onto a high and sustainable growth path . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The white paper goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is equally clear that unemployment, particularly long term unemployment, is inherently unfair. People who are denied employment for long periods are denied the income, social contact and creative outlets that work provides&mdash;they are denied an essential element of what it means to be an Australian.  <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While economic growth is the key, waiting for growth alone will not suffice. To bring unemployment down more rapidly, the Government will intervene directly to assist long term unemployed people, and those at risk of becoming long term unemployed. This, in turn, will increase the rate of economic growth that can be sustained.</PARA>
<PARA>So the policy notion, the intellectual notion, of `growth plus' was thus embedded into public policy. It was embedded into public policy until this government in the recent budget took it away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was very concerned to see in budget paper No. 1 the government's forecasts so far as growth in the economy is concerned. At 2&hyphen;23 of budget paper No. 1, it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GDP growth is expected to slow a little to 3&half; per cent in 1996-97.</PARA>
<PARA>That means there will be no pick up so far as the unemployed are concerned. At 2.24, under budget forecasts and forecasting assumptions, we also see reference to one of the great employment generators of recent years, a significantly improved export performance. It is forecast in the budget papers that the net export contribution to net growth in GDP will actually fall from a positive one per cent in 1995&hyphen;96 to a negative three&hyphen;quarters of a per cent in 1996-97. The budget paper goes on at pages 2&hyphen;27 and 2&hyphen;28, under the heading `employment and unemployment', to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the labour force expected to grow solidly through 1996-97, the unemployment rate is expected to decline only gradually to around 8&frac14; per cent in the June quarter 1997, compared with 8.6 per cent in the June quarter 1996.</PARA>
<PARA>Quite clearly, they are optimistic forecasts because earlier in the budget papers, at 2&hyphen;4, you see the assertion that, even though we are dealing with those relatively small figures of 3&half; per cent, the budget paper describes growth predictions as strong. If you cannot get four per cent growth, you will not do anything about unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that this government is not interested in growth in the economy, and certainly not interested in taking special steps to help the long-term unemployed, is reflected by comments made by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) recently, as reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 6 September under the headline: <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4326"> `Long-term jobless may rise with reforms: Vanstone'. The political editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, Michael Gordon, reports:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government's radical redesign of labour market assistance might not reduce the number of long&hyphen;term unemployed, the Employment Minister, Senator Vanstone, conceded yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">While declaring that the new system would have a higher success rate than the former government's Working Nation, Senator Vanstone said it was "theoretically possible" that long-term unemployment would rise.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, a concession that it certainly would. So we have no growth in the economy and, by way of removing over $1.8 billion worth of labour market programs, the removal of any capacity on the part of Australian society to take special steps, extra steps, to help in particular the long-term unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the government's policies and the government's budget do not address unemployment. They do not address unemployment because there will be no growth in the economy. You need four per cent growth to make any dent in unemployment. That is one of the reasons why the government refuses to set any official targets for unemployment, even though an unofficial target was eked out of Minister Vanstone on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> recently. The government concedes it is not going to get better than 3&half; per cent growth. In addition, it is taking away positive steps which might add to economic growth or add to the assistance that we give to long-term unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the areas where policy will certainly take away from economic growth is in industry, trade and export enhancement measures. If members have a look at the budget response by the MTIA dated 29 August under the heading `Risks and challenges', they will see the MTIA honing in very ferociously on this point saying: `4 plus growth must be our goal' and then goes on to make the point that very many trade and industry enhancement measures have been abolished or significantly reduced by the government in the budget. So far as industry policy is concerned, they of course go to any incentives to Australian business to develop Australian ideas here by way of the 150 per cent R&amp;D tax concession being reduced to 125 per cent. So far as <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> export enhancement measures are concerned, the cornerstone is the effective gutting of the export market development grants scheme, EMDG.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was interested to see last night, on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Face to Face</EMPHASIS> program on the Seven Network, the Acting Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Mr Fischer, being interviewed. There, on one of the rare occasions on which he has spoken about trade or exports, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are changes, there are industries which are expanding rapidly, there are export industries, the high tech ferries being exported to the world expanding absolutely rapidly . . . </PARA>
<PARA>What he did not tell the interviewer on that program and what he will not tell the House is that Australia's high-tech shipbuilding industry is now almost exclusively an exporting industry. We have seen in recent weeks members of that high-tech industry coming out and criticising the government for its abolition of the shipbuilding bounty. So, on the one hand, we have the trade minister lauding the efforts of Australian industry and, on the other hand, we have the minister for industry, Mr Moore&mdash;where Moore means less&mdash;abolishing this very successful bounty. None of this creates jobs or helps the longterm unemployed. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As all members in this House know, in every city there are a million stories&mdash;and, sooner or later, most of them end up on the desk of the local member of parliament. Often, the saddest cases involve the ramifications of the Child Support Agency. The end of any marriage is usually tragic; unfortunately some marriages, when they end, involve not so much horrible endings as horrors without end. All too often the courts and other government agencies become battlegrounds in which two people fight out their all too understandable, but usually counterproductive, battles.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support the concept of the Child Support Agency. Every parent has a responsibility for his or her children, regardless of where those children live, with whom those children live <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4327"> or where the parents live. Parental responsibility does not end when a marriage ends. Nevertheless, the Child Support Agency perhaps epitomises the problems which arise when a system of rules attempts to deal with the infinite complexity of human circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth noting that the Ombudsman has more complaints about this particular agency than any other government agency. In 1993 in just two days, when the family law committee. opened a two-day hotline to deal with Child Support Agency difficulties, 150,000 calls were received. In fact, only 700 of those calls got through because of the inability of the hotline to handle the absolute deluge of people seeking to tell their story. But of those 700 people who did get through, nearly all of them had one fundamental message&mdash;and that was `thanks for listening to our plight'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the family law committee in 1994 dealt with the operation of the Child Support Agency, it received more than 6,000 submissions&mdash;which, again, is a record for any parliamentary inquiry. I suppose there are two basic problems with the Child Support Agency. The first is the administrative difficulties within the operations of the CSA itself, and the second is the level of income left with non-custodial parents. Again, I am not blaming the CSA for these problems but simply highlighting the difficulties when any set of rules, any set of formulae, tries to deal with the infinite complexity of human relations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to quote the member for Chifley (Mr Price), who was the chairman of that family law committee and who is to be congratulated for his good work on this matter. He said, describing the CSA:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The agency's case load has grown from 23,000 to 275,218 in May 1994. It is increasing at the rate of about 7,000 per month. The ombudsman has been consistently critical since the 1989&hyphen;90 report. The issues of concern included lost documents, delays in registering agreements and court orders, delays in all stages of the process of the recovery of arrears, delays in arranging for auto&hyphen;withholding of wages, delays in recording and acknowledging payments, inadequate telephone service, failure to answer correspondence and return telephone calls, inability to provide full and accurate information, miscalculation of arrears, inaccurate advice concerning arrears, inappropriate recovery action and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> failure to take remedial action after proper notification of mistakes.</PARA>
<PARA>The member for Chifley went on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The CSA needs to dramatically change the way it deals with non&hyphen;custodial parents, especially their first contact. There is an average delay of 142 days between the start date of liability and the day upon which DSS pays the custodial parent the first child support payment. In addition, an average of 65 days of arrears accumulates before the NCPs are first informed of the amount of their liability. If there is an administrative delay the period of arrears is greater.</PARA>
<PARA>As I said, I am not here to criticise the Child Support Agency which is dealing with very difficult situations and often very emotionally fraught situations. But it is, nevertheless, worth pointing out the predicament that people face. I am referring to information prepared with the guidance of the CSA which describes the position of Peter and Jenny who have just separated and the two children who live with Jenny. Peter earns $33,000 a year and Jenny $19,000 a year. Peter pays 27 per cent of his taxable income, minus an amount for personal support based on a pension level, as child support. So Peter loses $6,800 to Jenny. This reduces his disposable income, after tax, to well under $20,000; while Jenny's income, after tax and the family income support payment, goes well over $25,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is entirely correct in principle because a father must always take responsibility for his children. I suppose the difficulty arises if Jenny remarries perhaps to someone with a much higher income, or if Peter wishes to remarry and begin a family. What happens then? Systems of rules are not very good at dealing with these problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my own electorate my office has to deal with the full range of problems with the Child Support Agency. We have situations in my electorate such as a woman who, after eight months of separation, still has not received a cent from her former husband towards the upkeep of her children; another woman has a husband who earns a vast amount of money but is able to hide it for the purpose of avoiding his CSA liability; and men are paying child support payments to ex-wives who drive Porsches, thanks to their new husbands or <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4328"> live&hyphen;in boyfriends, while they themselves are driving old Datsun 180Bs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps, most tragically, we have non-custodial parents who believe that it would be better for them to leave their employment and go on social security rather than to continue working and paying child support payments. It is this group which believes that, because the Child Support Agency scheme does not apply to social security recipients and because, for the purposes of CSA payments, income cuts out at 2&half; times average weekly earnings, the child support scheme ignores both the poor and the rich and targets middle-class men.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not my part to make judgments in this matter&mdash;I would not be inclined to go so far&mdash;but there are some tragic cases. One that my office has been dealing with for some months involves a former husband who works for a large institution and who earns roughly $40,000 a year. His former wife works for the same large institution, has much the same seniority level and much the same earning capacity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ex-husband has been assessed for child support at $800 a month and he calculates&mdash;and I stress that these are his calculations&mdash;that the 50 hours of work a week he does makes him roughly $70 a week better off. He believes, rightly or wrongly, that he is carrying his own cross to his own personal Golgotha. He was able to gather together, just from amongst his own work mates in his own operation, a dozen other people in similar situations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not pretend for a second to know the answers to this difficulty. Obviously, parents must support their children whatever happens to those children and whatever happens to the parents when marriage ends, but at the same time we have to acknowledge the real situation that parents are in. Perhaps, if there is one change to the CSA that should be considered or could be considered, it is the possibility of taking into further account the circumstances of parents, especially those who remarry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to thank in this parliament my own staff for the work that they have done with people in these circumstances. I would <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> like to thank those working with the Child Support Agency, who probably have the most difficult job of anyone working in government. They need the wisdom of Solomon every day. I might note, in conclusion, that Solomon gained his reputation for wisdom in what was in effect a family law matter.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join with constituents in expressing concern about a variety of trends in the government's policy, locally indicated by the closure of the CES office at Granville, the threat to Medicare offices and a wide variety of government infrastructure. In Thursday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS>  Fred Argy, visiting fellow at the ANU, accurately pronounced:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . under the Howard Government the trend to smaller Government is set to accelerate and will no doubt receive applause from financial markets, economic fundamentalists, the OECD, the International Monetary Fund, rating agencies etc . . . much of what is being done in the name of small government has very little to do with economies&mdash;it is driven by faith and ideology.</PARA>
<PARA>He further commented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The short term adjustment costs associated with smaller government are painful and prolonged and the long term gains very unevenly distributed.</PARA>
<PARA>New Zealand real disposable income statistics for lower and middle income families in absolute terms have deteriorated by four per cent to five per cent in the 10 years to 1994. I think we all remember the great flocks of coalition members that were on every second plane over to New Zealand for a month or two to get the latest word on the future of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He went further in that article to talk about labour market programs. We are quite aware that today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> newspaper put a hole in Minister Kemp's allegations that the previous government had been given advice that its five per cent target was not able to be achieved. But he said of labour market programs:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are other options including wage subsidies, training and counselling programmes, investment in worthwhile public infrastructure and industry support programs oriented towards exports and innovation. These require proactive government intervention and can achieve positive results for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4329"> unemployment without asking low-paid workers to bear a disproportionate share of the adjustment bundle.</PARA>
<PARA>That essentially is what the government is attempting to do. We have heard today that it has reiterated association with and even support for the concept that Australia should send thousands of jobs to the Philippines and that there is no real national interest in keeping 22,000 Australians and their families in employment by Telstra, despite massive profits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the fact that this government is having no U-turns and, as the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) would say, there are no ifs and buts, the reality internationally is increasing questioning of the very kind of policies that it is now coming forward with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I noticed a recent article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Guardian Weekly</EMPHASIS> where Wall Street economist Stephen Roach, one of architects, as he is called, one of the gurus, one of the most forceful proponents, of downsizing and the gains to be made in efficiencies commented&mdash;and he is now on his way back from Damascus&mdash;`it is now highly debatable whether plant closings, layoffs and other tactics for improving efficiency would result in long-term improvements for the economy and workers in general'. He also suggested that corporations had put too much emphasis on slash and burn restructuring strategies that have put an extraordinary pressures on the work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is in a way a very significant questioning of the process that this government feels is right for Telstra, right for Australia and right for industry in general. It is the kind of philosophy which has been questioned internationally, despite the fact that we see it fundamentally undermining industry policy, we see it undermining every assistance that it can to Australian exporters and we see it surrendering support for `Australian made' campaigns, which only cost $2 million but which have had a very strong multiplier effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the kind of policy which sees them sacrificing the Orbital engine. It is a product they themselves were promoting a few months ago. The Minister for Administrative Services <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> (Mr Jull) had his photograph out there with the Orbital engine, taking them from the company. Yet we see months later the companies saying, `We have been led down the garden path. We have been betrayed. We have been undermined by the R&amp;D syndication changes.' I say that these things are being questioned. It is worth while noting a very recent article on 28 July in Britain's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Independent</EMPHASIS> newspaper. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reports by three blue-chip international bodies&mdash;the World Bank, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)&mdash;have all roundly condemned rising inequality in Britain, now revealed as the most unequal country in the Western world.</PARA>
<PARA>Not only did we know that these people were trying to fly over New Zealand every second minute but also that the other great architect of international policy, economic policy, employment situations and privatisation was, of course, Margaret Thatcher.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now we do have the long-term impacts of the kind of thrust this government is supporting. There is the concept that it will all trickle down. Gradually there will be gains from these privatisations; there will be gains from the reduction of community service; there will be gains from basically letting the market run things. Now, in 1996, we do have indications of the outcomes of these kinds of policies. In that article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Independent</EMPHASIS>, Geoffrey Lean and Yvette Cooper cited what Thatcher said in the House of Commons in May 1988:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Everyone in the nation has benefited from increased prosperity&mdash;everyone," exalted Mrs Thatcher . . . </PARA>
<PARA>They say this in 1996:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not so. Statistics show that the poor's share of Britain's national income shrank in the 1980s, for the first time since the Second World War. Worse, their poverty deepened. The poorest tenth saw their real income plunge by almost 20 per cent between 1979 and 1993, while the richest tenth increased their takings by 61 per cent . . . By the Government's own figures, the number of people living in poverty almost trebled over this period, from 5 million to 14 million, a quarter of the population. More than 4 million of the poor are children, again three times as many as when the Conservatives took office. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4330"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A 1991 survey showed that one in five parents and one in 10 children had gone without food in the previous month because they did not have money to buy it.</PARA>
<PARA>I think we remember the questioning of the growth of inequity in this country. There were constant arguments in this parliament about whether there had been growth in regard to higher income earners vis-a-vis the general population. I think what can be said indisputably is that, even if we concede a marginal growth and even if we concede that change, we look at this pattern in Britain and in the United States and see that there are far greater concerns. The charade that has been put forward in this country is that despite significant changes in the social wage in this country, which have helped those on lower incomes, there is a far worse pattern in the kind of road they are now directing Australia down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In another article `Wages, Work and Welfare Under Siege'&mdash;which is from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New Perspectives Quarterly</EMPHASIS>, Spring 1996&mdash;Robert Reich, the Secretary of Labour in the United States, talked about the kinds of policies that those opposite wish to pursue with their fraternal associates in the United States. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As if blind, the Congress is now considering just the opposite course: Billions of dollars of cuts in student loans, work-study programs, job training and other means by which people from working-class and poor homes still have a chance to get ahead. When we most need paths from the old economy to the new in order to help overcome the widening income gap which threatens the future prosperity and stability of this nation, this is nonsensical. Slashing education and training to cut the taxes of those who have already crossed safely to the other side is a grotesquely misguided transaction that will only accelerate the secession of the successful from American life.</PARA>
<PARA>Robert Reich, the US Secretary of Labour, noted the pattern in the United States. When you hear about the kinds of policies that have been pursued in the United States&mdash;the kinds of cutbacks in training, education, universities and labour market programs&mdash;it is certainly reminiscent of what this government has inaugurated in its short period in power. He further commented:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1980, California spent two percent of its budget on prisons and over 12 percent on higher education. Now the state's proposed budget will devote almost 10 percent to prisons and 9.5 percent to higher education. By the year 2002&mdash;just six years away&mdash;the state Department of Corrections will gobble up 18 percent of the state's budget; higher education will nibble on one percent.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the sad reality of where the country is going. It is the sad reality of what is going to occur when this government spends its entire time trying to cut back on labour market programs and trying to hide unemployment through a dole diary, which employers have told them very emphatically they are not going to cooperate with. The employers have told this government that they will not fill out this dole diary. There is only one conclusion to reach from the inauguration of this suggestion; that is, that it will be utilised to kick people off unemployment benefits for short durations under the guise that they did not go to employers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was reference in question time today to another undermining of the social fabric of this country in regard to very stringent cutbacks in occupational health and safety. One only has to look at the reality in this country&mdash;the pervasive connection between the growth of subcontracting and independent employers, injury rate insurance coverage and the question of where injuries are concentrated. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HE4">Mr ANDREW</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The federal parliamentary Labor Party, yes. In fact, it is coincidental that I rise to participate in the grievance debate to pursue one of the areas of privatisation that has been a resounding success in my electorate&mdash;so much of a success that I have electors all over the electorate seeking similar sorts of privatisation and self-management initiatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In all of the controversy that has raged over the Telstra sale, much of the focus has been on the need for the partial sale of Telstra in order to fund what is to be known as the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia. Part of the resources from the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia are designed to be used for the clean-up of the Murray-Darling Basin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I may mention this as an aside, I happen to think the partial sale of Telstra is very important not only for the establishment of the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia but also because that sort of resource would allow the coalition to take approximately $7 billion and reduce the previous government's overseas debt by almost 10 per cent. Of course, reducing our borrowings by that amount would make the whole capacity to service that debt so much easier. From my point of view, the partial sale is important not only because of what it does to our debt but also because it frees up money and allows us to establish a Natural Heritage Trust which will be used for the rehabilitation of the Murray-Darling Basin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The majority of South Australian irrigators&mdash;all of whom clearly depend on the Murray&hyphen;Darling system for their survival&mdash;are in my electorate. Too few people realise that South Australia's allocation of water out of the River Murray is a very small five per cent. I will repeat that: of the River Murray flows, the allocation for South Australia is five per cent. The allocation for Victoria is 34 per cent; New South Wales, 57 per cent; Queensland, two per cent; and the ACT, one per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make that point because South Australia, with a relatively small portion of that flow, has been desperate to use that water efficiently. In fact South Australian irrigators, along with the state government and the federal <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government, are currently involved in a rehabilitation of the irrigation scheme in South Australia. That is making an enormous difference to the efficient delivery of irrigation water across that state and could well be the benchmark for further irrigation development and irrigation efficiencies in New South Wales and Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In South Australia, of the five per cent of water in the Murray flow allocated to the state for diversion, private irrigators take 317 gigalitres, government irrigators take 220 gigalitres, and urban water users&mdash;those who are resident in Whyalla, Port Augusta and the city of Adelaide&mdash;take 263 gigalitres. This means that approximately a third of the allocation goes to private irrigators, a third to government irrigators and a third to urban water users. In addition to that, of the total flow coming into Australia, 239 gigalitres goes to river maintenance&mdash;that is, to some sort of environmental flow to maintain the quality of the water&mdash;and 800 gigalitres is lost in evaporation as a result of the sunny climate characteristic of South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point I want make in the opportunity I have in the parliament this afternoon is that South Australian irrigators have done a great deal over the last five years, and they will continue with this, to ensure that their use of this relatively small portion of total River Murray flow is very efficient. Throughout my electorate a number of Community Action for the Rural Environment committees have been established. These CARE committees have focused on the way in which irrigation water is being used, have encouraged growers to install neutron probes and tensiometers and have ensured that growers are using only as much water as their crop demands. This application of sufficient water to be used by the crop has ensured that drainage inflows back into the River Murray have been minimised. Salt lodes returned to the river have been minimised as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This accurate use of water through neutron probes is possible only when you have the capacity to deliver water to growers as that water is needed. Under the old system, the water was delivered in open channels and by flood irrigation. The intention of the grower <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4332"> was to saturate the soil profile beyond its water holding capacity, producing enormous drainage inflows, and then leave it until just before it dried out before saturating it again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With modern irrigation&mdash;that is, with water delivered in pipelines and the capacity for each grower to access the water every week or 10 days&mdash;it has been possible to simply give the plant the amount of water that it requires, just as a suburban garden or lawn grower may choose to top up his or her lawn only every three days or once a week. As a result of this change from open channels to pipelines, there has been a dramatic fall in the amount of water being used per hectare for irrigation in South Australia and a dramatic rise in the tonnage of produce being grown of each of the crops. I make this point because the outcomes have been particularly exciting where this rehabilitation has occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rehabilitation has been possible because of the combined efforts of the state government, with 40 per cent of the cost of the rehabilitation; the Commonwealth government, under the Murray-Darling Basin Commission, with 40 per cent of the cost; and the growers, with 20 per cent of the cost. This sharing arrangement has meant that the inefficient irrigation systems that characterised the distribution of water in government irrigation schemes in the past have all but disappeared and been replaced by a much more efficient irrigation system. This has meant a dramatic saving in water and the possibility for additional acreages to be allocated to irrigation in South Australia. The outcomes have all been good and incredibly encouraging.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point that needs to be stressed in this grievance debate is that there remains one area in the South Australian irrigation area where rehabilitation is not occurring&mdash;that is, the Loxton irrigation area. The difficulty faced by irrigators in Loxton is that the Loxton irrigation area is the only irrigation area in the nation, as far as I know, that was established under the war service land settlement scheme as a settlement area for returned service men and women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth is the governing body that owns the Loxton irrigation war service <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> land settlement scheme. It is now imperative that this government accept the challenge that was not undertaken by the previous government&mdash;that is, the challenge of rehabilitating the Loxton irrigation area, not to ensure that South Australia becomes more prosperous but to ensure that River Murray water is more efficiently used in the Loxton area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rehabilitation of Loxton would probably cost in the vicinity of $20 million. The debate right now between the South Australian government, which clearly stands to win because this rehabilitation would be occurring in South Australia, the Commonwealth government, which owns the scheme, and the growers is how the cost of that rehabilitation should be apportioned and whether or not the 40:40:20 formula that applied to the South Australian government irrigation schemes could be fairly applied in Loxton.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The importance of rehabilitating the Loxton irrigation area cannot be overstated. It allows irrigators in Loxton to have exactly the same access to modern techniques as will exist in all other irrigation systems in South Australia. It allows a dramatic saving in the quantity of water used and it also allows a dramatic increase, as you will appreciate, in the productivity of all the crops being grown.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My irrigators have little to apologise for, given that it has been calculated that a wine grape crop will return $1,000 for every megalitre of water used, while a cotton crop will only return $300 and a rice crop a bare $90 for every megalitre of water used. The importance of allowing irrigation expansion in South Australia and of saving water in South Australia cannot be overstated. I encourage the Commonwealth to accept its share of the responsibility for the rehabilitation of the Loxton irrigation area and to negotiate with the state government the sort of package that will allow that rehabilitation to be accelerated and to be installed as soon as possible.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

Joe Riordan AO. During question time on Thursday, 26 June 1996, in response to a question by the member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey), Mr Sharp seriously questioned the competency of Mr Riordan in his role as chair of the Sydney Airport Community Consultative Committee and also questioned the role of that committee. In referring to an overseas study tour of other noise affected cities, the member for Hume said that the result of the trip was `a 66&hyphen;page report by Mr Riordan which made no recommendations relating to the management of Sydney airport'.

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="R36">Mr ALBANESE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Withdrawn. The fact is that it is unfortunate&mdash;as the government has pointed out&mdash;that I am raising this now. The fact is that if the minister was indeed the sort of person who deserved to be a minister in this House, then he would have responded to Mr Riordan's letters to him. He has refused to do that. Mr Riordan wrote to the minister and invited him `to withdraw your statement at the earliest opportunity by way of making a personal explanation to the parliament or by a full and unqualified withdrawal in a  public statement. Otherwise I invite you to repeat your statement within seven days hereof in an environment which does not attract parliamentary privilege'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am of the view that he should do one or the other: he should back the allegation up by making a statement outside the House and should be prepared not to hide behind parliamentary privilege. Of course, not only has the minister failed to repeat the allegation outside; <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> he has also failed even to respond to Mr Riordan's letter. I am  afraid this is pretty consistent with the response which my constituents get over issues such as the insulation and acquisition program in Sydney when they write to the minister&mdash;no response. Talk about government fatigue. He has only been in office for six months and it seems that he is worn out already.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister did not respond so Mr Riordan, then took the next step of writing to the Speaker. The Speaker responded in writing saying that it was open to Mr Riordan to ask another member to inform the House of a rebuttal. I might note on that point that we should pity someone outside who does not know a member of this House who can raise things on their behalf. But I am very honoured to respond to this point. If I can leave this place with a record half as impressive as Mr Riordan's and go on to achieve what he has achieved, then I will be very proud indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On this issue the minister said that Mr Riordan's report made no recommendations relating to the management of Sydney airport. That is just not true. As a result of Mr Riordan's study tour, a 20&hyphen;point recommendation for noise amelioration at Sydney was submitted to SACCC. This 20&hyphen;point proposal was adopted with overwhelming support. These 20 points were the result of studies of operational measures at other airports and, in most cases, they concerned procedures that our authorities said would not be viable. I will give a couple of examples. The first was at Los Angeles, where airport operations are overwhelmingly over water. This procedure has been restricted in Australia and we were given a long list of reasons, by our authorities, why we must have takeoffs to the north at KSA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second example&mdash;one of the most important recommendations for residents of my electorate&mdash;was to land all jets arriving from the north 1,000 metres further down the main north&hyphen;south runway. This would decrease noise over Leichhardt, Marrickville and Sydenham by over a decibel. That might not sound much, but remember that decibel readings are logarithmic. This means a one <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4334"> decibel decrease equals nearly half the noise. The Australian authorities said it could not be done, but Mr Riordan saw the procedures necessary for such landings in practice at Washington airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that the minister for transport tried to establish that no recommendations from this study tour ever existed. On Friday, 26 August the new committee established by this minister, the Sydney Airport Community Forum&mdash;known in my electorate, of course, as the North Shore Hockey Club, given that it is made up of more people from the north side than the south side of the harbour&mdash;considered the 20&hyphen;point recommendation. It is very interesting because, of those 20 points, only four of them&mdash;four out of Joe Riordan's 20 recommendations to SACCC&mdash;were knocked back by the committee, which is overwhelmingly stacked with the minister for transport's appointments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These included very important measures such as banning the use of reverse thrust between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m.; landings further down the main runway, as mentioned previously; extending the time for nose&hyphen;to&hyphen;nose operations; and landscaping to reduce ground noise that affects residents in Sydenham, St Peters and Tempe. SACCC also made a number of other important decisions. We recommended open space and community facilities for Sydenham in the acquisition zone, and that was taken up by the government. We recommended the expansion of the acquisition and insulation zone to natural boundaries. This was adopted and then put in place by the Labor government. SACCC held a number of open meetings so that all members of the community could have an input. Joe Riordan showed the importance of not having an MP as chair so that someone was independent rather than simply answering to the transport minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Down the track I would like to see whether the costs of the SACF compare with the costs of SACCC because so far from the Sydney Airport Community Forum we have seen no changes to airport operations. Today a press release was put out by the transport minister saying that there will be take-offs to the north on runway 34R. That proposal went before <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Sydney Airport Community Forum and failed to get support on the basis that there is no representation on the forum at the local, state or federal level in regard to the Botany area covered by this airport operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to the minister's press release today there will be no EIS. It announces: `We do not need an EIS into take-offs to the north on the new runway'&mdash;despite the fact that the EIS into the third runway at Kingsford&hyphen;Smith explicitly ruled out those take&hyphen;offs&mdash;`so we will just get rid of those EISs, we will have no community consultation, and we will have an entrenching of the parallel runway operations at Kingsford&hyphen;Smith airport'. This is all about increasing the capacity of the airport and the fact that the government is prevaricating over the need to have a second Sydney airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know that the attack by the Minister for Transport on Mr Riordan was pretty shallow and, I would say, pretty grubby. It was a stunt by someone who had not bothered to look at Mr Riordan's record. It was a stunt by someone who had not bothered to find out what recommendations SACCC had made. It was a stunt by someone who, on his own record of failure of the Sydney Airport Community Forum to consult with residents who were affected by these changes announced today, is a disgrace. He did not even know that Mr Riordan was a former member of this House. His words in response to the question were: `The chairman was Mr Riordan, a former state member of parliament.' It took an interjection by the former Minister for Transport, Laurie Brereton, to set him straight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is one thing to question a person's reputation, but you should have some understanding of who that person is and some basis of fact before you do it. To engage in the sort of dorothy dix answer we saw some three months ago is a disgrace. To simply refuse to respond in the three months since then backs up that disgrace. The current minister needs to get on top of his portfolio. He needs to acknowledge that the Department of Transport, Air Services Australia, the FAC, Qantas and Ansett have their own agenda. It is not an agenda that is necessarily concerned with the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4335"> residents surrounding Sydney airport, or any other airport in Australia for that matter. Until he does that, it is not a replacement for good policy development and implementation to engage in scurrilous attacks on people who deserve respect and who performed as a minister a fair bit better than the current Minister for Transport and Regional Development.

<ELECTORATE> (Shortland)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(5.14 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My grievance this afternoon is the harm and hurt being caused to my constituents by the Howard government. The attacks are two&hyphen;pronged. First, we have an attack on the people looking for work and their families. Last Friday at noon the Belmont CES was closed by this ruthless government. This was despite protests from the people who use the service, from people generally in the region and from myself. I have here signatures from 474 petitioners requesting the House to require the government to ensure that the Belmont CES remains open but, unfortunately, the way the House orders operate at the present time, Mr Acting Clerk, and because of the rigidity of existing arrangements in the House, these petitions can be presented but once per week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I bring that before you, Mr Deputy Speaker, because those rules are too rigid. They do not give people an opportunity to have their voices heard in this place. These petitions will come forward in the normal presentation. They will not be read before the House until next Monday. The people who have signed them include people from Belmont North, Belmont South, Belmont, Valentine, Eleebana, Floraville, Marks Point, Pelican, Blacksmiths, Swansea, Swansea Heads, Caves Beach, Nords Wharf, Cams Wharf, Catherine Hill Bay and other adjoining areas. As I said, they cannot be presented until next week under the rigid rules that apply in this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The closure of Belmont CES is part of a broad assault on people looking for work, and on their families, by the Howard government and by Senator Vanstone, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. That assault includes the closure of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Belmont CES, which forces people in need to find transport further into Charlestown. It is not only transport; it is time. When one is out of work, looking for work, has a family to support and there is limited public transport available, it is all the more difficult. What is happening here is that the people who can least afford to bear further hardship are those who are having hardship imposed upon them by this government. They are being punished for not being able to find jobs that are not there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second thing is the slashing of the Eastlakes Skillshare service, the service that has been so successful in assisting in training those most in need and helping place them in jobs. Skillshare centres deal with the people who need more help and have greater difficulty, the people who are not going to be picked up by some high&hyphen;flying, private employment service. They will grab those people who are easy to place, but the people who need more training and need to have their skills updated, who are at the upper end of the age scale or at the lower end of the training scale, are the people that skillshares pick up. They are the people being hurt most by this government's measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The abolition of most employment projects and training programs has greatly reduced employment and training opportunities for those needing work. For example, Lake Macquarie City Council in my electorate has greatly improved a range of public facilities under the former Labor government's Working Nation program. The foreshores of Lake Macquarie, cycle paths, community park projects&mdash;all have benefited greatly under the employment projects of the Working Nation program. The abolition of the Working Nation programs means that the $3.7 million the Lake Macquarie City Council has received in grants since November 1994 will be no more. The abolition of the program means the Lake Macquarie City Council will be some $2 million per year worse off in funding for training programs and to help carry out public works that are needed and can be done efficiently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More importantly, more than 100 people will not have access to work or training <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4336"> programs. Mr Deputy Speaker Andrew, in your electorate you have areas like I have in my electorate and you know what I am talking about&mdash;you have experienced it. You know the kind of community projects that need to be carried out and the kind of community works that do not rate No. 1 in all the cost benefit studies but are desirable works which would provide opportunities for people who need training and help. It is country and provincial Australia that has greater need for funding of these programs than any of the metropolitan areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is abundantly clear that this callous Howard government is trying to punish people who are looking for and need to find work. They are saying to them, `No matter how hard we, the Howard government, expect the unemployment rate to increase, we are going to make it tougher for your family by closing the CES office, by forcing you to travel further and to take more time, by cutting out the chance to improve your skills, by abolishing the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, by reducing the staff of that combined agency that may replace DEETYA, by slashing skillshare funding and by pursuing economic policies that will produce slower economic growth.' This government is reverting to the old habits of the Fraser&hyphen;Howard government of punishing the unemployed for being unemployed, rather than driving the economy to create more jobs and to produce a faster growth rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second area of attack on my constituents is the pending closure of the Belmont Medicare office. This office only relocated to new premises at the Belmont city centre some 10 weeks ago. Obviously, tens of thousands of dollars have been spent in that relocation. That office services a wide area around Belmont. It is a cash payments office, it has a dedicated staff, it does a very good job; and for no reason whatsoever, just out of the blue, comes a message from the department that the office is to be closed. The people who use that office are going to be greatly inconvenienced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> We are told in various ways that the government has in mind some process where by pharmacies can collect applications through a computer terminal in their pharmacy. As I am told by a pharmacist, people will be able to go into the pharmacy and key in their own details, have them sent through to Medicare and then the necessary cash payment or rebate will be made by EFTPOS to a bank or building society account for the constituent. How on earth can that possibly function? It can't. Are we are saying to aged people, `Go in and learn, at retirement age, how to operate a keyboard. Do it in a pharmacy. No&hyphen;one will watch. You will get it all right and it will go to your bank account that you do not use because you are having trouble with it already as they close down'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have talked to some of my pharmacists and when they try to explain it to me they are nonplussed. They are gravely concerned because they have a good service, everybody knows how it functions, it works efficiently and people are happy with that. They have certainty, they know what they are about and they are not worried about it. It will be replaced by who knows what, for no apparent reason other than ideology. It is really ideology that drives this. This is the same Prime Minister Howard who said when he was Treasurer Howard, with Prime Minister Fraser, `We will maintain Medibank.' They maintained it by making nine changes in seven years and at the end of the seven years the public threw them out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The public want the certainty of a Medibank, now Medicare, type service. They want to know that if they are ill they are going to get the kind of service that is necessary to care for them, that the standard of medical care they get will not be according to the condition of their pocket but according to the condition of their health.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have here another 328 signatures from petitioners, which will also have to go through the same process of having to wait until next Monday to be presented to the House. This makes it some 509 signatures now. These are coming forward&mdash;not engendered or encouraged by the local member&mdash;spontaneously out of the community through some of the pharmacies and doctors and others, the professionals who use the service, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4337"> who see the grave danger and the great difficulty for people when you abolish or break down the Medicare service that is part of people's lives and part of their security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what the ideologues opposite do not understand. Medicare is about providing to people who are ill or may become ill the security of knowing that they can get the medical care that is demanded by their condition of health. That is why they pay for the levy through their taxes. The process is automatic, and if they have to make a cash payment because of the doctor's arrangements they can go straight to Medicare and make a claim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to bring these matters before this parliament to emphasise yet again to the government: please don't harm my constituents because of your ideology. The people who are unemployed are not the ones who create unemployment. They are the victims of economic policies that generate unemployment. Similarly, the people who use Medicare services, who make the claims, are people who are ill. They are not the people who drive the health insurance industry in this country. We as a parliament ought to be supporting the people who use the services and trying to give them greater security and greater assistance. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<TIME.STAMP>(5.24 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to speak this evening on the state of the cattle industry in Australia and the grievous state that many of our primary producers find themselves in. Prices in the cattle industry have continued to fall since March this year and are now 40 per cent below those that existed in December 1995. Prices are worse now in real terms than in the great herd liquidation times of the 1982-83 drought. In fact they are now worse in real terms than in the beef depression of 1975, when primary producers shot their cattle because they simply weren't worth the freight to transport them to the abattoirs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reasons for this grievous state of the industry are many. There has been a major liquidation of the United States herd. There has been a surge in US supplies because of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> corn prices being at a record level and dry conditions. United States exports have surged, causing a drop in our beef prices. Japanese imports of US beef have in fact grown by a tremendous amount&mdash;80 per cent, or an additional 53,500 tonnes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the first four months of this year the following figures were recorded for the major countries that purchase our beef. Japan has dropped from 51 per cent to 45 per cent. Korea has dropped from 31 per cent to 27 per cent. In the last three years, the amount of beef that Taiwan has taken has dropped from 70 per cent to 50 per cent. The Korean government recently suspended imports from 3 April. The difficulty with mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalitis, in the United Kingdom has also had a severe impact on our exports of beef to the European Union.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The appreciating value of the Australian dollar, which has now reached US79c to US80c, has stripped a total of eight per cent from our export returns. In fact, beef producers' returns are the lowest now that they have been in the last 80 years. Farm cash incomes dropped by 43 per cent in 1994-95. In 1995&hyphen;96 they dropped by a further 69 per cent. Beef producers' positive cash flow has also declined. In 1993-94, 81 per cent of beef producers had a positive cash flow. In 1995&hyphen;96, a mere 58 per cent of beef producers will have a positive cash flow. Add to that the abattoir closures that we are seeing. Since April, three of the Australian Meat Holdings abattoirs have closed. We have seen Oakey, South Burnett and Blayney close, with many threatened closures in New South Wales as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most serious threats that the Australian beef industry faces will be in May of next year when Argentina will declare itself foot and mouth disease free. Fortunately, most of the Argentinian beef herd goes into domestic production and into the domestic market. However, if they were to choose to supply meat to the international market, which undoubtedly they will do, they could easily swamp the international market and Australia's traditional markets. The United States have already indicated that they may well <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4338"> look favourably on suppliers of beef from Argentina.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We see a tremendous industry tragedy unfolding in the cattle industry in Australia. I would say that much of this tragedy can be attributed to those on the other side of the House. I would like to share with you now some of the meat processing costs in Australia which we have been left with after 13 years of Labor government in this country. Do you know that in Australia the meat processing costs are three times higher than those in similar United States plants&mdash;not 10 per cent or 20 per cent but 300 per cent?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we compare ourselves to our small cousin across the Tasman, New Zealand, we are looking at twice the processing costs in Australia&mdash;again, not 10 per cent or 20 per cent but 200 per cent. Packaging costs are up to 40 per cent higher in Australia than in Europe or the United States. The port of Melbourne is only 40 per cent as efficient as Antwerp, the top rated port in the world. Let us look a little closer to home&mdash;to Auckland, again across the Tasman. We are only two-thirds as efficient as the port of Auckland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite frankly, the tragedy that is unfolding in the cattle industry in Australia can be laid in large part at the feet of those on the other side of the House. There are many examples of what our incumbent government is doing to alleviate the difficulties in the cattle industry. The government's budget policy has been welcomed throughout the cattle industry as a reasonable document which will do a great deal to boost incentive and employment in the industry. Industrial relations legislation will hopefully overcome many of the difficulties that we find in our meat processing plants and our packaging and transport industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) is also looking at more effective methods close to home to achieve changes in our meat industry. He is looking at effective institutional arrangements for the industry. He is looking to reform AQIS in order to reduce the costs of its export inspection programs. For several years those on the other side of the House allowed meat inspectors to reside in towns where there were no <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> longer abattoirs. It is little wonder that the industry is burdened by excessive costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning now to arrangements within the industry itself, the minister has brought into being a task force and steering committee to look at operations and particularly the structure of the Australian beef industry. We now have a historic opportunity to allow the beef industry to control its own destiny, to restructure, to be internationally competitive and to return a living price to those who depend on the industry in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have spent the last two months consulting with cattle people right throughout my electorate in a serious of crisis meetings. We have had input from producer meetings as far flung as Emerald, Charters Towers and Roma. Cattlemen were so concerned about the future of their industry that over 150 of them chose to attend those meetings. There have been discussions with the major lobby organisations within the cattle industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Undoubtedly, producers want control of their product, their marketing and their industry because they have the greatest stake in the industry as measured by assets. In fact, producers have, in terms of their investment in their industry, over $36 billion invested in the cattle industry. They make the greatest contribution through value adding and they make the greatest contribution overwhelmingly in the portion of levies that they pay to support not only the Meat Industry Council and the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation but also the Meat Research Council.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I welcome the minister's new task force to look at the structure of the industry and believe that from this will come a very much revitalised structure for the beef industry in this country. We will be looking, we hope, at producers having more say in their own industry and being able to control their product and their destiny. We should be looking at a more responsive and transparent industry, certainly not the one that we were left by the previous government. The previous minister for primary industries was the one who brought in the Meat Industry Council and has caused a great deal of grief for the meat industry by not allowing producers to have sufficient say in their industry, by not <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4339"> allowing a more dynamic Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation with our marketing arrangements overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The figures that I have given for the decline in Australian beef into its traditional markets speak for themselves. We have a historic opportunity, through our new minister for primary industries, to revitalise our vibrant cattle industry and to give those who live in the industry&mdash;not only those who live on the land but also those who work in the abattoirs and those who live in the towns out in the west of this country and depend on the cattle industry for their small businesses and for their transport businesses&mdash;a chance to find a revitalised cattle industry. I welcome the changes that our minister for primary industries is making and look forward to a very much more competitive industry on the international market and a better livelihood for those throughout the industry.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<TIME.STAMP>(5.34 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Following on from the honourable member for Dawson (Mrs De&hyphen;Anne Kelly), who has just resumed her seat, I too am concerned about regional Australia. The seat of McMillan goes from Pakenham to Traralgon, with its centre being the Latrobe Valley. I am concerned about the way in which Labor walked away from its responsibilities to regional Victoria in its 13 years in government. I am amused that on Sunday of the previous weekend shadow minister McMullan and a Victorian senator travelled to Gippsland on a `Labor listens' campaign. For 13 years they had an opportunity to listen to the people of regional Australia and they walked away from that responsibility. They stopped listening and were dealt the blow that they deserved in regional Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was a beneficiary of the Labor Party in government not listening to the people. We have heard what has happened in those regions. May I say, importantly, that mistruths were told about the unemployment figures in McMillan in the run&hyphen;up to the 1996 election campaign. Labor argued that the unemployment figure in McMillan was around 8.2 per cent. We knew that it was 14.6 per cent. What a surprise to find out after we were <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> elected that those who were supporting Labor's claims now agree that the rate is 14.6 per cent for people who cannot get a job and that another 10 per cent of people would like to work if they could&mdash;the underemployed. So nearly a quarter of the community in the seat of McMillan would like a job. We cannot be expected, as a new government, to address that within months, but what we can be expected to do is to continue to listen and to continue to address ourselves to the needs of country communities such as those in McMillan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The surprise from today's newspaper report of the forum held by McMullan and his offsider was this: `a bigger crowd than was expected arrived at the community forum'. There were 60 people at the forum. There are 80,000 voters in the electorate and some 200,000 people. The Labor Party went to listen and 60 people turned up to a Sunday afternoon forum. I do not know what it cost to rent the hall but it would have been some hundreds of dollars. So they paid dearly for 60 people to turn up. It was such a beautiful day in McMillan on Sunday that they could have turned up at a park somewhere and saved themselves the cost of hiring such a large hall.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MT4">Mr BROADBENT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right, they did run the budget like that. Not only did these people stop listening to regional and rural Victoria, but they actually failed to ever come down and do this type of exercise. I believe that the former member stopped listening and the former Prime Minister stopped listening. They liked to put their hands up when they said they had funded something in the electorate. In fact, they were putting their hands up every week making promises in the run-up to the March election campaign.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his reply to the budget, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) mentioned that Moe had been disadvantaged by one of our policies. In fact, that was not the case. We have delivered to the township of Moe that which was committed in previous budgets. But we were not committed to every fly&hyphen;by&hyphen;night promise that was made by the then Prime <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4340"> Minister's department or by local members. My community has been surprised and relieved that this government has had concern for what is happening down there and has delivered on every piece of funding that was of a budgetary nature and allocated it. What we have not delivered on is airy&hyphen;fairy promises made by candidates or previous members in the run-up to that most important election of 2 March.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember on election day picking up a hitchhiker who was on his way to one of the outer areas of my electorate, Traralgon South. He said, `You're the Liberal, aren't you?' I said, `Yes, I am.' He said, `My mum and dad voted for you.' I wanted to inquire as to why. He said, `My mum and dad want a change. They want a new opportunity. They want opportunities for themselves and their kids, and that's why my mum and dad changed.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was thrilled that that young fellow said that to me because I believed that if his mother and father had changed, there were a whole lot in my electorate of McMillan who were actually going to change their vote. I was buoyed in the middle of that afternoon to know that two people put Australia first and changed their vote from the Labor Party to the Liberal Party and put their faith in John Howard to take us into the next century. What a pleasing thought that was.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did not ask that young fellow his name. His parents were just a couple of genuine people who lived out there. Apparently, one had a job and one didn't. They would have liked a job but they said that Labor has let them down. They let them down to the point where people got sick of the promises. I have an address here all about small business. Had I known that the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser) was going to be at the table, I would have used it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are still recovering from the heartbreak in McMillan from `the recession we had to have' and from the restructure that has taken place that was driven by the Keating government. I now notice that in all their questions at question time the opposition are walking away from privatisation and saying that `privatisation' is now a dirty word. Yet the former government spent its time privatising <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> everything they possibly could as it affects the seat of McMillan.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The budget is a plan for getting Australia out of deficit and debt. The coalition government did not create these problems, but we will fix them. This is a budget made for mainstream Australia. It is a budget that delivers for the Dunkley citizens of today and for the Dunkley and Australian citizens of the future. It is a break from a history of Labor budgets where the horizon rarely stretched beyond the next election. Les Coleman in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  of 19 August said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In four Budgets under Paul Keating's prime ministership, the Federal Government lifted income by 31 per cent, cut infrastructure investment . . . sold $9 billion in assets (Qantas, Commonwealth Bank) and still lifted its debt by $68 billion. Labor "wasted" $107 billion in voters' assets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Each of us can add a raft of longer standing economic issues: scandalous unemployment, chronic weaknesses in the dollar, high real interest rates, inflationary breakouts, dismal economic growth, high and rising foreign ownership . . .</PARA>
<PARA>This was the product of Labor's reckless pursuit of short&hyphen;term political gain and patronage at the expense of the national interest and the future of our citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4343"> Even the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) admitted on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> program of 21 August that `there always had to be a bit of pain'. This is Labor's cursory acknowledg ment that they have to wear the blame for the coalition's difficult though responsible decisions, decisions that simply could not be put off any longer because of the way Labor wasted its 13 years in power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor traded off our standard of living, future prospects, international competitiveness and environment for short&hyphen;term political gains. The nation was going backwards while Labor tried to talk up successes. Yet the opposition leader continues to claim that the Labor government was on the doorstep of bright fortunes for our nation, rectification of the havoc it engineered and improved job prospects for the record number of unemployed people it created. What nonsense! Labor is still talking about its now infamous false dawns. Labor's actions are a regrettable part of the past. But I want to concentrate on the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to borrow an environmental acronym to differentiate Labor's budgets from the first Howard&hyphen;Costello budget. The coalition's first budget is an ESD budget&mdash;economically sustainable democracy. It is delivering on our key election commitments via an affordable budget that does not sacrifice our future. It has sound programs and initiatives that are not made vulnerable by paying for them on bankcard. It has funded, rock&hyphen;solid measures that you can count on from a government that you can count on and decisions that are soundly grounded on good public policy. There is nothing fickle or foolish about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget delivers on key election commitments. Families are given a break. Employment and investment are encouraged. Small business is given the incentive to get up and go again. Self-funded retirees are given a fair go. Young Australians and the unemployed residents of Dunkley are given new hope. Moreover, the budget gives a solid and reliable financial base upon which the coalition government has provided for a stable and secure future for important services and government programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Deservedly, the family tax initiative is the centrepiece of this budget and will be welcomed by more than 2,000,000 low income Australians, including families who care for <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> about 32,000 of Dunkley's children. The family tax initiative produces an extra $7.70 a fortnight for each dependent child under 16 or dependent secondary student under 18, provided that the family's income does not exceed $70,000 a year. This will increase by $3,000 for each extra eligible child.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Single income families with a child under five, including sole&hyphen;parent families, fare even better with an extra $19.20 per fortnight in the pockets of eligible households. This extra cash will be paid to eligible families through either tax or the social security system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is cash for kids, an increase in the disposable income available to Dunkley's families who need it most. It is money that is likely to be spent on everyday consumer needs, which will boost retail spending in the Frankston District Centre, Mornington Village, Karingal Hub and local shopping centre precincts like Seaford, Frankston North, Langwarrin and Mount Eliza. It is little wonder the budget has received the thumbs up from the Frankston Chamber of Commerce.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Across the budget the government is spending $13.6 billion in assistance to families, up 9.2 per cent on the previous year. This support is responsibly targeted. For instance, at the time of the 1991 census only 200 of Langwarrin's 2,300 families with children had incomes above $60,000, roughly equivalent to the cut&hyphen;off levels for assistance announced in the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most important policy areas for the coalition government is the health sector and improving the way in which the public and private sectors combine to meet the health needs of all Australians. We need an effective, efficient and viable mixed private and public hospitals health system. The private health incentives give long&hyphen;overdue recognition to those privately insured citizens who seek to provide for their own health needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the Opposition and his Labor colleagues seem to rejoice in the recently announced premium increases, as if it proves the virtue of their `never give private health insurance an even break' approach to health. The people who battle to pay their premiums <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4344"> know that the increases are a product of Labor's 13&hyphen;year assault on private health&mdash;another Labor legacy with a lag. No matter how you score it, the government's incentives soften the financial impact of Labor's blind side on private health, making premiums more affordable than they would otherwise be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition has been true to its promises on Medicare, bulkbilling and community rating. From 1 July next year, single people earning annual incomes of more than $50,000 and families earning more than $100,000 will have to pay a penalty of one per cent for not privately providing for much of their health care needs. This decision was not easy, but Australians reacted negatively when they discovered that Labor's former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, did not have private health insurance, which means that he would have effectively been bumping off a lower income person when he went into hospital for treatment. The budget will help restore the viability of the health insurance sector and reduce pressure on waiting lists and waiting times in the public system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's national childhood immunisation program will go a long way towards improving Australia's current performance of little over half of our young children being fully immunised. The $2 million program to increase the awareness of the benefits of breastfeeding will be greeted with pleasure by the Frankston branch of the Nursing Mothers Association.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Pensioners and self&hyphen;funded retirees benefit from the budget in a number of ways. The coalition has delivered on a commitment that the previous Labor government had not provided for in the forward estimates. Pensions will continue to be adjusted twice a year in line with changes in the cost of living. This is not politics but sustainable income security for older Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Self-funded retirees will at last receive tax justice over a two&hyphen;year transitional plan to equalise taxation rebate entitlements with age pension recipients. The coalition is committed to an even higher standard of caring nursing homes. In an extension of Labor's 1988 policy for hostels, people seeking to enter a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> nursing home will be asked to make a contribution if they can afford it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dunkley residents will also benefit from the government's introduction of retirement savings accounts. Despite Labor's wild claims about how the coalition's workplace relations changes will supposedly hurt Australians, Labor never mentions that at the end of its 13 years in government 1,650,000 Australians were in casual employment. The coalition's retirement savings account is a capital guaranteed product that the banks can offer casual and part-time employees or people nearing retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Child care and family arrangements are important issues in Dunkley. At the previous census five years ago, about 3,300 of Frankston's 7,000 two&hyphen;parent family households had both spouses in either full-time or part-time employment. The choices parents make are complex. It is our role as a government to expand and facilitate the range of choices that are available. At times, Labor forgot that many households would like one parent to stay at home, particularly in the formative years of their children. The family tax initiative is the most obvious government support in this budget for facilitating this choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Dunkley by the bay, just over 800 places are available in privately run long day care centres: 540 places are in outside school hours care, 403 places are in family day care, 235 places are in community based long day care centres and 28 places, the smallest number, are in occasional care. The government is removing the operational subsidy paid to community based centres of $22.60 per place for children under three years and $15.10 a week for places of older children. At the same time, the government is providing $8.3 million over two years to enable those community based centres to obtain financial and management advice that will enable them to manage their centres through this transitional period to an equal footing with the private providers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4345"> A difficult decision the government was forced to make was ceasing the Commonwealth dental health program from 1 January next year. When Australia's financial circum stances improve, perhaps this is a program that might be considered for reintroduction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition government is increasing funding to schools by $167 million to almost $3.5 billion this year. Capital works funding for government schools is being maintained in real terms. In ending Labor's restrictive anti new schools policy, St Anthony's Coptic Orthodox School in North Frankston will be able to offer further parent choice. The higher education changes announced by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) on 9 August are changes that will sustain and enhance the vitality and viability of the university system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The modest savings in Commonwealth outlays will see a continuation of MCG full house plus crowd numbers able to obtain access to academic, merit based, government funded university places in Victoria&mdash;110,410 places in 1996, 109,730 places for the 1997 academic year. Additionally, a $30 million scholarship scheme will see 1,000 HECS free places introduced each year&mdash;an excellent equity measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposal to permit universities to make available limited full fee paying places over and above their HECS places will facilitate improvements in the use of university infrastructure and the education capacity while creating opportunities for increased private investment. This opportunity is currently available to everybody unless they are an Australian. Given that the quality of their graduates is a key marketing point, it would be self-defeating for universities to admit full fee paying students who cannot cut the mustard when it comes to the academic ability to complete the course or to qualify as a graduate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A student's investment in higher education is the most valuable foundation they can provide themselves in aiming for a higher earning and more employable future. Repayment of the public investment in their education starts at a time when a student begins to enjoy the private benefits of this education. With students still paying as little as a quarter of the cost of their education while the community continues to fund the vast majority of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> university expenditure, the stepped HECS amount will improve the way private and public benefit of higher education is funded. These reforms underwrite the public funding of the higher education sector into the future in a sustainable and affordable way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget supports the introduction of a major program for school to job training. Funding has also been increased for apprenticeship training and incentives for employers, improving the prospects for the people of Dunkley who are not academically minded. Employment policy has been considered in detail by the government, and some changes were clearly necessary. The coalition wants to shift the focus to meeting the needs of the unemployed person to make them job ready. Assistance will be client driven, not program driven.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition government believes that providers of labour market assistance should be primarily rewarded for placing job seekers in real jobs. This is a great opportunity for well&hyphen;performing training providers in Frankston and Mornington to prosper. Of course, they also have the option of becoming placement enterprises themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I would like to talk about small business in our community. In Dunkley, we have over 8,000 small to micro businesses. Almost $260 million in incentive payments for employers of apprentices and trainees will be made available over the next year, including commencement payments for $1,250 for each person in these categories taken on from 1 December this year. Small business will benefit from the important reforms to the capital gains tax regime. The government's task force for small business will report by the end of the year on ways the government's paperwork demands on small business can be cut. These changes help prepare small businesses in Dunkley by the bay to take full advantage of the consumer spending boost, the family tax initiative and the sustained reduction in interest rates the coalition has produced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a budget that is sound, responsible, affordable and targeted. It is the embodiment of ESD&mdash;economically sustainable democracy. The budget delivers on key election <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4346"> commitments to families to give them a break, to encourage employment and investment, to help small business get going again, to provide a fair go for self-funded retirees and to secure affordable quality health care for all. Above all, it renews hope for young Australians and those looking for work. The budget is responsible, but caring. The certainty that the budget provides simply by being affordable will bring security to small business, income support recipients and the beneficiaries and clients of Commonwealth programs and services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor left Australia with many problems. Labor's final dishonest legacy was the $10.3 billion deficit that it left while claiming we were operating in surplus&mdash;the same deficit that has made all federal programs vulnerable under the previous Labor government as political considerations guided what they would be funding in the following years; the same deficit that removes any credibility from those opposite in comparing the coalition budget with what they claim Labor had planned. The outdated forward estimates that Labor relies upon have a $10.3 billion-plus hole in them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For Australia's sake, correcting Labor's reckless overspending had to be added to the jobs that the coalition was elected to do. The most useful and constructive action Labor can now take is to get out of the road and let the Howard government get on with the job that was too much for them. Reining in budget outlays is never easy and often unpopular. It is a responsibility that the government's vision for a more secure and better future for all of us obliges it to fulfil.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today, the concerns of three constituents who have contacted me illustrate the problems with this budget. The first contact came from a 47-year-old man who has been unemployed for two years. He is a construction worker who wants work in Canberra. I could offer him no hope. The level of activity in construction in this territory is in serious decline: buildings which were planned by government have been abandoned, and home building has dropped right away because of the number of public servants who are being retrenched. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> There will be no growth here in the construction industry in the foreseeable future and this man's prospects of getting a job are negligible, unless he moves away&mdash;and, if he moves away, he has to leave his family behind as they are in a house that he already owns.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second constituent to contact me works with mentally ill people and is desperately concerned about the contraction in services being experienced in that area. That is a direct result of cuts in Commonwealth funding but particularly, and principally, to the states and territories&mdash;and one part of this budget is the severe reduction in funding by the Commonwealth to states and territories. This person told me that it is not the financial bottom line which matters but the quality of community life. The quality of community life will be directly and deliberately undermined as a result of this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third constituent to contact me is a teacher. She expressed concern about the passivity of students; the lack of funding for stimulating programs in music and the arts, which she had hoped to provide in schools; and that funding for primary and secondary education was not adequate. Again, the funding by the Commonwealth of the states and territories which is being reduced in this budget will undermine that; it will constrain the provision of those enlivening programs that every parent hopes their child will experience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The concerns of those three constituents illustrate major potential problems with this budget. I want to mention four issues. The first is the economic basis for this budget; the second is the general approach to programs; the third is particular aspects of those which affect my own electorate in the ACT; and the fourth is the underlying assumptions which affect this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, there is the economic rationale for the budget. The government has tried to portray the justification for this budget as being the existence of a fiscal crisis in Australia. The previous speaker, the member for Dunkley (Mr Billson), illustrated that. He talked about a $10 billion deficit.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4347">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That deficit is simply due to a change in economic circumstances which has occurred since the previous government's budget was brought down. It is a fact that the economy is slowing. The new budget, which we are now debating, will contribute to that slowing down because it is a contractionary budget. It is a budget which will reduce the rate of economic growth; it will, therefore, reduce growth of revenue; and it will lead to direct increases in requirements for outlays in support for the unemployed. Therefore, it will directly contribute to the growth of the deficit in the general sense of influencing our level of economic activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact of the matter is that Australia has no fiscal crisis at all. I see that the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), the previous Treasurer, is in the House; he has argued this case very powerfully. We have the lowest national debt as a proportion of GDP of any of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. Therefore, debt reduction is not a priority. Of course, it is always better if you have less debt. But it is not a priority to reduce the debt any further. At a time when we have extraordinarily and extremely damaging high unemployment, clearly our highest priority is to contribute to reducing unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet this budget does nothing about that problem. It has been predicted that unemployment at the end of the financial year will be at about the same level as it was at the beginning of the financial year&mdash;approximately 8&half; per cent. In the meantime, it is likely to rise. We saw in the last figures to come out, those of last week, that unemployment is already rising. Inevitably, that will be the effect of a contractionary budget which involves cutting the number of public servants who are providing programs around Australia and, therefore, an undermining of economic activity in the business sector will be effected also.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, as well as having a very low debt, we have a very low deficit as a proportion of GDP. It is one of the lowest in the OECD area. It is simply not a priority to get that down immediately to nothing. It will come down automatically to zero over the next two or three years as economic growth accelerates, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> if the level of economic growth is allowed to be maintained at the four per cent that it was in the previous financial year under the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But that is not going to be allowed to happen. This government is deliberately slowing the rate of economic growth as a result of this contractionary budget. One would like to see interest rates come down even further to contribute also to that goal. That would seem to be justified in terms of international comparisons because real interest rates in Australia are relatively high when compared with those in other comparable countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there is no fiscal crisis in Australia. It is simply not justified to act as if the principal goal of the budget should be to reduce outlays in order to reduce the deficit in order to reduce debt, because those are 10th&hyphen;rate goals at a time when our highest economic, social and equity priority must be to reduce unemployment. So that is my first and central point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second issue I want to deal with is the cuts themselves&mdash;and they are really devastating. This is the most destructive budget in living memory. I cannot recall in the postwar period a budget that has been as negative and as destructive and has involved so much cutting. It is qualitatively different from anything else that has happened under any government in living memory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People imagine that in some way Labor led the way with this. It is quite true that Labor was careful, cautious and moderate in its expansion and that in some areas it did appropriately reduce outlays. But this is a qualitatively different order of magnitude and direction of change in most areas because in most areas Labor went on increasing outlays in order to meet high priority expectations of demand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me go through some of the most damaging cuts that have been budgeted for. I will go through them in the order in which they appear in the budget papers, not necessarily in any order of priority. The first one which comes to mind&mdash;and I am dealing only with the major ones&mdash;is the reduced funding for the ABC. That will seriously undermine the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4348"> diversity of views, the diversity of information and the diversity of cultural sources in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are major cuts to the ABC. We are not talking about shaving off a little or just simply improving efficiency; we are talking about very substantial cuts which will have a direct result in reducing the quality and extent of broadcasting, including television services, by the ABC in Australia&mdash;something which the great majority of people in Australia do not want to see, by the way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just going on very quickly, the next one is the reduced funding for universities. I cannot seriously imagine how the previous speaker, the member for Dunkley, can say that this is good for students. It will reduce the number of places. It will prevent an increase in pay for lecturers, which has already fallen significantly behind comparable levels to which they used to be related in the past. It will reduce the standards of accommodation and improvements in research.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a very damaging set of decisions relating to universities as a whole and to the expectations of HECS paying by students. Just ask anyone who is connected with universities whether they think it is going to improve their quality and they will quite obviously tell you that it is not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we get to the aid program, which has been severely cut in a way that no other government has ever done in Australia. That is just a reflection of the meanness of this government and its lack of concern for absolute poverty in developing countries&mdash;something that most Australians do have some concern about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we get to the cuts in hospital funding. The opinion polls show that, when people are asked what they want most from government, they say they want improvements in health services, improvements in education, increases in employment and protection of the environment. Here this government is getting stuck into that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1">  The government is abandoning the Commonwealth dental program&mdash;how completely irresponsible and inequitable. The government is also abandoning the expansion of the nat ional landcare program, for heaven's sake. This is a participatory, effective, environmental program involving communities all over Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there are massive cuts in funding for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander programs&mdash;an area where justice requires that these programs be well funded. One would like to see them even better funded because infrastructure in those communities is still pitifully poor. But there is going to be major cuts in those areas. That is disgraceful and again a reflection of the meanness of the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Migrants are going to have to wait two years for social security payments. How are they going to live in the meantime? Maybe some will have families that will be able to support them, but what about those who do not have families? Another mean-spirited change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we have the abandonment of, or the cuts to, a whole series of labour market programs&mdash;all of which contributed to improving the employment prospects of the long-term unemployed. Careful empirical testing has shown that those programs were of real value in improving the employability of the long-term unemployed, yet they have been massively cut at a time when unemployment is very high and rising. How completely irresponsible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The regional development program is to be abolished. I do not know how the National Party allowed that to happen. There are to be major reductions in the national highway system. Anyone who drives on the roads knows that they need major improvements still, and that is always the case. We are not, effectively, large investors in our national infrastructure yet. We should be expanding infrastructure investment. It has fallen to about half of what it was 20 years ago as a proportion of national income. It needs to be expanded, not reduced. That is true also of investment in railways, which is also to be cut.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there are these huge reductions in payments to the states and territories. Since the states and territories are the major deliverers of most direct community services, such <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4349"> as health and education, cuts by the Commonwealth to them will be directly damaging to the wellbeing of the people who use those community services. That involves the great majority of the community in one way or another. That is also extremely damaging.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, we have the expansion of the so-called efficiency dividend, which is simply a downsizing measure. After 10 years of the efficiency dividend&mdash;something which may well have been justified in the early years&mdash;now the only way most agencies can cope with an expanded efficiency dividend is simply to reduce the number of people they employ. Therefore, that will reduce the quality and the accessibility of their services and will also, of course, undermine personnel morale in those organisations. That is a seriously damaging policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am on the Council of the National Library, and I see directly the cost of that expansion of the so-called efficiency dividend. It simply means that the National Library has to reduce its staff by another 30 or so positions from 570 to 540, or something of that order, in ways that cannot be offset simply by improvements in efficiency. It simply means that various cuts have to be made in the kinds of services that are provided around Australia. Those cuts have national implications, but they also have implications for my own electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the next two years in Canberra, 6,000 Public Service positions are to be lost out of a total of about 50,000. That is going to be extremely damaging to those individuals who lose their positions, but it will reduce the quality and accessibility of a whole host of services around the country. Let me just take one example. How is it possible for the Taxation Office to lose 800 positions in Canberra alone and still collect the national revenue as effectively? It simply does not make sense at a time when building up the revenue base in fair and equitable ways is important in order to minimise the deficit, to cut back on the number of people employed there, when each of those people generate substantial amounts of revenue. That seems very misjudged to me.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same sorts of points could be made about every organisation which is going to lose positions. As well as that, of course, it is not difficult to imagine what the loss of 6,000 positions in the public sector is going to do to the private sector in Canberra. It will mean that for the first time in the history of this town there will be a reduction in population. In all probability that will reduce business turnover and it will lead to a reduction in demand for housing. House prices are likely to significantly fall. Unemployment in Canberra is already above the national average, and it will rise further above the national average. This is going to be extremely damaging in a way that has never occurred here before. It is a quite unprecedented set of cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well as that, it is not just the loss of Public Service positions which is going to be damaging. I have already mentioned that building projects have been abandoned. At least three of those have been abandoned and possibly more will be abandoned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cuts to universities and the increases in HECS will undermine the number of students who can afford to go to university, the number of places which are available and the pay of staff. The major reductions in the training and work experience programs will increase unemployment and reduce the capacity of the long-term unemployed to get back into the work force. There has been a whole series of cuts to the ABC, to the arts, to the National Botanic Gardens, to baseline funding for the Australian Sports Commission, to improvements in the National Portrait Gallery&mdash;a whole series of smaller projects, each of which are important in their own right and which together add up to substantial reductions in funding for important programs, which will be damaging to the Canberra economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think this is such a seriously damaging budget that I have written this letter to every one of my constituents. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">John Howard's budget betrays the people of Canberra and the whole of Australian society. This budget slashes funding for services, cuts jobs and imposes new charges on those who can't afford them.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in the chamber tonight to support the budget and to oppose the amendment moved by the shadow Treasurer (Mr Gareth Evans). When one listens to the previous speaker (Mr Langmore), one appreciates why this government inherited a $10.3 billion Beazley black hole. I listened carefully to his wish list of spending&mdash;the way in which he would like money appropriated to lots of areas of government activity&mdash;but the simple fact of the matter is that the honourable member did not explain how we as a nation could afford to continue to spend more than we earn. We as a government were not happy about many of the cuts that we had to make, but we inherited a budget situation of horrendous dimensions and something had to be done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget addresses the failings of the former government and is an example of fiscal responsibility. As national debt and budget deficits continue to threaten the future of Australia, we simply could not stand back and ignore this problem. Although we did not create it, we do have a responsibility to fix it, and that is a responsibility from which we <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have not shirked in the budget delivered by the Treasurer (Mr Costello).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The breathtaking hypocrisy of those opposite is mind boggling. We were told prior to the election that the budget was in surplus. We sought to get access to the government's updated figures. We were told that they were not available. So everyone accepted that the budget was in surplus and we made our election promises prior to the election on the basis that the budget was in surplus, as publicly stated by the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley). However, on the Monday after the election these figures which were not available miraculously became available and we saw the magnitude of Labor's legacy over the last 13 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition will ensure that never again will there be such a deception perpetrated on the Australian electorate. At the commencement of each election campaign our charter of budget honesty will make sure that everyone is aware of the actual budget situation. A document will be signed by the secretaries to the Treasury and the Finance departments certifying the economic situation confronting the country. So when the people of Australia vote at the next election and every succeeding election they will vote with the full knowledge of the budget situation. They will be able to judge the political parties in accordance with the facts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to the last election, the government told us that the budget was in surplus. The government got it wrong to the extent of $10.3 billion. Is it any wonder that politicians and governments are held in such low esteem? We had the Leader of the Opposition, the then Minister for Finance, telling us over and over again that the budget was in surplus. What deceit! We are determined to make sure that the people of Australia are never again deceived in this way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When one listens to the honourable member for Fraser one could ask the question: what does it matter if we have a budget deficit? When I listen to the honourable member for Fraser, I am reminded of comments made by a former Deputy Prime Minister Jim Cairns when the Whitlam government was running out of the money. He said, `Keep the printing <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4351"> presses running.' The same philosophy continues to be adopted by the honourable member for Fraser.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why does it matter if we have a budget deficit? It matters because Australians simply cannot continue to spend more than they earn. When one looks at the results of 13 years of Labor government, we ought to appreciate that for the financial year 1996-97 as Australians collectively we will pay back $9.345 billion in interest on Commonwealth debt. This is primarily as a result of Labor running consecutive budget deficits. To give an idea of how the former government ran up the debt of the Commonwealth like there was no tomorrow, one only has to look at the 300 per cent increase in Commonwealth own debt in the last five years&mdash;from $32.6 billion to $105.9 billion. Those opposite have been suggesting that this is good economic management. It goes to show why they are so irrelevant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over that five-year period, Commonwealth own debt went up by $73.3 billion. That is over the period from the end of June 1991 until the end of June 1996. That is a threefold increase in the level of Commonwealth government own debt during this period. That is just incredible and says it all. Labor members have the hide and the audacity to come into this place and suggest that the Howard government should continue to spend, spend, spend in accordance with their own philosophy when there is not any money to pay for such spending. What the former government did was spend today and, in doing so, mortgage the future of our children and of our country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Threats by the Labor Party and the minor parties in the Senate to block savings of $19 billion over the next four years are a danger to the future of Australian prosperity. An editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of last week called Labor's tactics `a threat of the most serious order', and it was referring to the blocking of only $7.3 billion and not the full $19 billion. The editorial further states that the budget's deficit reduction strategy:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . is essential to sound economic management and that undermining or delaying it would be against the national interest. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>One ought to look at the comments made by Ted Evans. Ted Evans is the Secretary to the Commonwealth Treasury appointed by the former government. He said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  of 3 September:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia would be "courting danger" if it failed to adopt stringent Budget policies but allowed government debt to remain unchecked at its present level . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  further stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Treasury Secretary's remarks firmly rebut the suggestions&mdash;coming especially from the Labor Opposition&mdash;that the Government had pushed its Budget deficit reduction plans too fast, with a commitment to cuts of around $7.15 billion in two years and a surplus in three.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Evans also listed three Howard government budget initiatives which would help support fiscal reform: the adoption of the underlying deficit concept in place of the headline measure; the already announced review of tax expenditures; and the charter of budget honesty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we have a greatly respected bureaucrat appointed by the former Labor government endorsing the Howard government's budget strategy. That says it all. Why can those people not back up their own bureaucrats? The simple fact is that the opposition has got it wrong. Labor, having failed over the last 13 years, is now seeking through the Senate to frustrate the mandate given to us by the Australian people on 2 March. The Labor Party is now saying that they are going to deny the mandate given to us by the Australian people.</PARA>

I think the shadow minister at the table admitted that blue collar Australia deserted the Labor Party on 2 March. We represent the ordinary, average Australian, and the party opposite represents the ACTU, Jennie George and a few interest groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We hear from those opposite that they are doing to our budget what we did to theirs. The difference is that we are seeking to implement our pledges; what we tried to do to the Labor Party when they were in government was to hold them to their promises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My electorate of Fisher in south-east Queensland is an electorate where the response to the budget has been particularly positive. My colleagues in the government parties tell me that I am not alone. The electorate of Fisher is interesting. It is rural, coastal and regional and contains much of south-east Queensland&mdash;indeed much of the Sunshine Coast, the 10th biggest community in Australia. My electorate stretches west to Kingaroy, Nanango and Cooyar and contains over 9,500 square kilometres of highly productive rural and regional Australia. It can accurately be taken that it is an area which will reflect community perception of an important document such as the budget. I am <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4353"> pleased to report very strong backing for the program of the government from the people of my electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget will help Fisher residents and other Australians. After 13 years of Labor government, unemployment in Fisher is around 15 per cent. Youth unemployment stands at about 33 per cent. This is a scandalous figure. This budget will help fix these problems by creating an environment where business can grow and invest. What we need to do in this country is have the situation where every small business is able to put on just one extra person. If that were to happen, unemployment would disappear overnight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that I was particularly impressed by the modern Australian apprenticeship and traineeship program, which has been allocated $207 million over the next four years. Vocational education and training in secondary schools will help ease the difficult process of transition from schools to the work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should be remembered that 75 per cent of Australians make this direct transition without undertaking tertiary studies. When one listens to the opposition's criticisms of our reforms to the tertiary sector, one would think tertiary students make up 100 per cent of young people. What the opposition wants us as a government to do is to disadvantage the 75 per cent of people who do not go to university so as to benefit the 25 per cent who do. I must say that our program in relation to tertiary education is balanced and fair and takes into account the competing interests of all sections of the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have long believed that in Australia we have had an inadequate emphasis on the importance of trade training. Many employers have come to me and said that they have advertised for skilled staff but have had almost no replies. We have had this obsession with tertiary education. Basically, everyone wants their children to go on to tertiary education, and that is understandable. There is a lot more prestige in tertiary education, and trade training has not had quite the same public image. What Australia needs are people who are trained in the technical area. The budget will, I believe, advance the situation so that we will have many more <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people who are able to take their place as tradesmen and tradeswomen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Support for the budget has also come from school teachers, parents and, most importantly, from those who are in the business sector. I wish that those opposite would, at this late stage, agree that we have a mandate. I wish they would say that they will support the positive initiatives of this government. If they really believe that our policies are wrong, they should allow us to implement our policies and then, of course, come the election, the proof will be obvious. Our policies will have worked&mdash;we believe they will&mdash;or they will not have worked, which is the point of view of the opposition. The Australian people would be able to judge us on performance. All we ask is the opportunity to be judged on the basis of our policies. We ask the opposition to give us the opportunity to implement our polices. We just want the opposition to give our policies the opportunity to work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regrettably, those in the opposition have denied the results of the election on 2 March and they simply fail to understand that they are no longer the government. They cannot implement their own program, but they are going out of their way to deny us the opportunity to implement ours. Is it any wonder that some of them, like the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans), continue to suffer from relevance deprivation syndrome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the major announcements in the budget was the reforms to labour market programs. Complaints come to me constantly from people who have been trained in many different courses. They have been trained and they have been given certificates but, at the end of all that training, there are no real long&hyphen;term jobs. The difference between the approach of this government and its predecessor is that we believe a successful outcome is a real long&hyphen;term job rather than a placement in a training program. Formerly, people were recycled from training program to training program. Those who were long&hyphen;term unemployed were no longer considered to be such and in fact were treated as short&hyphen;term unemployed. The program announced by the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4354"> government in the budget is positive. I believe that it is designed to benefit those people who do want to get into work. It will certainly deliver our policies in a very cost&hyphen;effective way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Working Nation failed in a large number of ways. The former government's own investigation into the program showed that it had failed through using the wrong mix of programs, providing the wrong incentives to employers, less effectively assisting the short&hyphen;term unemployed, not sufficiently helping the newly long&hyphen;term unemployed, promising everything from the job compact and delivering little, and getting the structure of case management wrong. We intend to make labour market assistance competitive. Job seekers will have access to a service that is more convenient, accessible and tailored to their individual needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under our policies, unemployed people will have the opportunity to return to real full&hyphen;time work. Our initiatives in the areas of health for older Australians, small business, regional Australia, the environment and the family are also very positive but, regrettably, time precludes my raising all of these. The family tax initiative goes a very substantial way towards doing away with the bias which has existed for so long against the Australian family. The Australian family is the basic unit of our society and, fortunately, at last we now have a government which is prepared to stand up for the Australian family. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to make some comments on the budget this evening, particularly in relation to the areas for which I am responsible as shadow minister: the environment, arts and the status of women. I have listened with interest to several speakers on the government side indicating that they believe the government has a mandate to undertake certain changes, including some very substantial cuts to government services and programs. What struck me during the election campaign was that the then opposition was not, in government, going to make any changes at all to most of these programs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can go through a whole range of initiatives and see that the government said <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that it would maintain funding, it would maintain programs and, if anything, in most cases it would increase funding, particularly in those areas for which I am responsible. The government said that it would maintain programs that have been part of the Labor government's agenda for the last 13 years. If they have a mandate, the government has a mandate to maintain the status quo.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we seen in the budget, however, is a very substantial shift from what the people of Australia were led to believe during the election campaign. There was a systematic deception of the Australian people during the election campaign. The opposition, now government, expected us to believe&mdash;and I think many people did&mdash;that they were not interested in change: they understood that people were sick of change and that they were anxious about their future. What they recommended to them and what they said they would deliver was very little in the way of change. It was the most misleading political campaign that I have ever witnessed, either as a member of parliament or simply as an interested observer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the area for which I am responsible there have been very significant breaches of promise, one after another. If the mandate the government has here is for cutting funds to the environment, then I would have to say that all of the advertisements, all of the policy documents and all of the statements must have been in the electorate's imagination. And yet, when you go back and have a look, they are all there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's actions to date, apart from the budget measures, speak volumes. I want briefly to address some of those. We have been asked to see the sale of Telstra, for example, as our salvation: that if only the opposition parties in the Senate would agree to the sale of Telstra there would be a revolution in environment funding. Nothing could be further from the truth, because what we have seen to date is a reduction in the core funding for the environment before any action has been taken. It was never expected that it would come through in this budget. We have seen very substantial reductions in the amount of money that is available to the environment <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4355"> from consolidated revenue. If ever Telstra is sold, or even if part of it is sold, it will be starting from a lower base, so the so&hyphen;called billion dollars over five years&mdash;which makes it look a bit slimmer&mdash;is not very impressive at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Line that up, too, against the actions of the coalition parties since they have been elected&mdash;the minister in particular. During the election campaign, the Liberals&mdash;the Nationals, I think, to a lesser extent&mdash;convinced themselves that they were going to be greenies in future. They had taken on a few green spots. They had read the polls and they understood that what has happened over the last decade has been a revolution amongst Australians in their conviction that the environment is very important indeed. I think we can now see that their recent poll&hyphen;driven conversion is superficial and misleading. They clearly have no appetite at all for resolving the inevitable tensions which arise between environmental protection and short&hyphen;term economic growth. Intelligent policies in government&mdash;budget&hyphen;driven and otherwise&mdash;need to reconcile environmental and economic needs and are simply not evident in the policies of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So far they have jettisoned environmental protection, as is evident in a number of decisions. Firstly, there is a likely green light for further uranium mining in Kakadu, in a World Heritage listed area&mdash;an icon, a jewel in the crown. They are contemplating significant expansion of uranium mining there and elsewhere. Decisions have already been made to expand woodchip quotas, including an open-ended availability of woodchips from timber taken from private land&mdash;and they tell us at the same time that they are worried about clearing. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They have abandoned the 15 per cent conservation criterion for native forests required in the national forest policy. They have already decided to allow substantial tourist development adjacent to Hinchinbrook Channel with clear impacts on the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage listed area, in direct contradiction of the advice they have been given by scientists and other experts. They attempted briefly to abolish export controls for minerals. Fortunately, we were <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> able to defeat that in the Senate, but it is worth noting that those controls have been used in the past to protect environmentally sensitive areas, for example Fraser Island, from sandmining.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen recent cuts to environmental projects, which I will go into in a moment. We have also seen cuts in this budget to labour market programs with a significant environmental component. A lot of communities are complaining about that&mdash;and quite rightly, too. They have refused to fund recurrent environmental programs from consolidated revenue, preferring to use the never&hyphen;never of Telstra. They have diluted Australia's commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and made a laughing stock of us internationally and they have threatened to hand over many functions and responsibilities to the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For instance, World Heritage listing is now only to proceed with the agreement of the relevant state government. If that had been the case in the past there would be no Daintree, there would be no Fraser Island and a number of other decisions simply would not have been made because state governments, particularly Queensland, have refused in the past to acknowledge the importance of World Heritage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have indicated that they would abandon the federal government's powers, particularly in external affairs, to ensure that national goals are met. Note, for example, the recent proposed chemical storage at Port Lillias in Victoria. This is a RAMSAR listed wetland, internationally listed as significant and containing the habitat of an endangered species of parrot. The minister has refused to invoke either his powers under the endangered species legislation or his responsibility to protect RAMSAR listed sites. He has simply abdicated all responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If that were not enough, we then had the budget, which was supposed to maintain, according to all the promises, the level of funding that had existed when Labor left government. The coalition clearly promised to maintain the environment budget and John Howard himself, the Prime Minister, made an explicit promise not to cut the environment <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4356"> budget at the launch of his environment policy. We probably all remember those cosy images of environment groups standing with the Prime Minister in the forest. He has betrayed them absolutely because this ironclad guarantee delivered by the Prime Minister when Leader of the Opposition was broken not in the second, third or fourth budget but in his very first budget. The environment budget was cut by 13 per cent&mdash;not by one or two per cent, and not the running costs, but by 13 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition had promised to spend an additional $84 million on top of maintaining Labor's budget on environmental programs in the 1996-97 budget. They said they knew that Telstra would not be sold by that point so there would be $84 million extra coming from the consolidated revenue&mdash;to be additional to Labor's budgeted expenditure. That additional funding was simply not provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, there has been a massive decline in the forward estimates. The environment department's forward estimates decline dramatically in the next four years, which would suggest funding responsibility is going to be shifted from the core to the so-called Heritage Trust. In the years 1999-2000 only $96 million is budgeted for environment programs. Labor's forward estimates provide a baseline from which to assess the coalition's environment commitments. As well as the 13 per cent this year we get a steady decline.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These declines would represent a significant broken promise, as the coalition's policy stressed that the Telstra money was to be additional to current budgeted programs and was not intended to replace those currently provided and yet that seems to be precisely what is happening. To use Telstra funds, if ever that sale occurs, to top up the forward estimates would also break the coalition's privatisation election promise that the proceeds from the sale of a public asset would not be used for recurrent expenditure, and yet that is what is happening already.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cuts to the environment portfolio's budget and the enormous drop&hyphen;off in the forward estimates is an explicit broken promise and the government's apparent inclination to use funds from the sale of Telstra to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> compensate for the cuts to the environment budget needs to be condemned. What it amounts to is a massive downgrading of the environment portfolio. It seems that the minister concerned is simply not interested in the environment and he rolls over to National Party resource ministers on every occasion he is given an opportunity to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I could touch on a couple of specific areas, one of the areas which I think has not been given a lot of attention but deserves it is the cuts to the Australian Heritage Commission. There has been a cut of 15 per cent from last year's allocation. As if that were not bad enough, the government has all but gutted the commission's national estate grants programs, which go to community organisations, by 82 per cent. It goes from $5 million to $1 million. This is as we lead up to the Sydney Olympics, when we will be trying to display our built heritage. Yet there will be no funds for community organisations such as the National Trust. The cut will hit community based environment and heritage programs the hardest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have not heard a peep from members opposite about these changes and yet they will have a big impact in their electorates. The forward estimates for the Heritage Commission indicate further cuts over the next four years. We have not seen the end of it yet. The government's cuts to the national estate grants program will have a devastating effect on the identification and conservation of Australia's natural culture and indigenous heritage. It will not be taken up by the state governments, who have had their funds cut too.                    </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen significant cuts to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, despite a big hike in the reef tax. All that has done is simply to reduce the government's contribution. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority's budget has actually been cut in addition to that. The government says it intends to raise an additional $3.5 million by increasing the tax from $1 to $6 per head for passengers on commercial passenger vehicles. We have seen that the tourism industry is not happy about that. They were not forewarned in any way about the increase. It is creating <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4357"> significant hardship for some of the smaller operators&mdash;again, in a public sense, not a whimper from members opposite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Environment Protection Authority, which is critical to environmental protection in this country, has had a 21 per cent cut to its budget. How can it possibly carry out its functions? The cuts largely relate to the abolition of the Labor government's $5 million paper recycling initiative which encouraged the recycling of high grade waste paper&mdash;a worthy initiative, you might think. Funding for the cleaner production initiative was also cut.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the government thinking of? Does it not understand the concern the community has about pollution and its willingness to support recycling? This initiative involved companies identifying and implementing opportunities for waste and pollution prevention, better use of resources and energy and increased productivity. And we are going to see further cuts over the next four years. The Environment Protection Authority budget includes only one major initiative: $8 million for the Tasmania water quality project. We are going to see very significant cuts overall into the funding for management of our national parks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of areas I could point to, but I want to make some further comments about the other areas for which I am responsible. The one thing I wanted to raise in this area is the fact that the minister has, without fanfare, undertaken a view of the department and its structure. I think it is very clear that these cuts relate to those changes. A piece of work was undertaken&mdash;I hold it up for those members who are interested&mdash;which has about 100 words per page. I would certainly like to know what this review of the department cost, because it is totally content free. It is free of the usual words you would associate with a decent piece of research. Yet this will bring about major changes in the department in a way, as the minister puts it, that will see these officials operating not to defend the environment but to do what the government wants. The minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have a politicised staff. If we ask them what they are doing, they say they are working for the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> environment. I would have thought that was what they should be doing. They do not say they are working for government. You don't find that in too many other departments. I'd like them to have a commitment to the environment, but the concept of making sure they advance environmental goals through effective government is, to a lot of them, almost foreign. He wants them to work for the minister for the environment and I might say his decisions on such things as Hinchinbrook indicate that he is going to ignore their advice in any case.</PARA>
<PARA>I want to turn now to the arts. This is an area where the minister has had almost nothing to say. He appears to be completely destructed&mdash;distracted, I should say; perhaps `destructed' is the right word&mdash;by his concentration on the sale of Telstra.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="PYNE" NAMEID="9V5">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9V5">Mr Pyne</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Maybe he's indestructible.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XS4">Dr LAWRENCE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I don't think so. I think he is destroying the arts as he goes along by ignoring them. The number of speeches and policy positions he has announced since you got into government could practically be measured on one finger. It was drawn to my attention that Whitlam had summarised the attitude of the conservatives to the arts very well. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To a conservative government the very idea of artistic expression and the challenge to accepted ideas, the spirit of innovation, experiment and questioning implicit in creative art are incomprehensible and dangerous. A Labor government welcomed these things. A liberal government fears them. So long as the liberals are in power the arts will have a secondary rather than an essential place in Australian society and Australian government priorities.</PARA>
<PARA>We are seeing that again some 20 years later: there is no policy and the minister is completely distracted. That is another area where lots of promises were made. There was going to be the status quo. The Liberal Party's art policy document said the coalition not only will maintain existing levels of Commonwealth funding to the arts but also is committed to new spending initiatives. So it was plus&hyphen;plus, win&hyphen;win. In an accompanying press statement the Prime Minister made this pledge:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To maintain the existing level of Commonwealth funding and provide $60 million over three years for initiatives which will provide greater public access to the arts and encourage new and emerging artists.  <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4358"> </PARA>
<PARA>By any measure, the Liberals have broken both of these core promises to the arts community. It is no good saying they were secondary; they were made by the Prime Minister. The 1996&hyphen;97 budget for the arts and culture through the Department of Communications and the Arts, excluding departmental running costs&mdash;which I think is generous on my part&mdash;again amounts to a 13 per cent cut, that is, $58 million taken out of arts, heritage and culture. If the coalition's pledge of an extra $60 million over three years is factored in, that is actually a reduction of $78 million short of what they undertook to provide during the election campaign. Of course, this is without taking account of the undoubted impact on arts and culture of cuts to the ABC and ATSIC, and the added pressure on running costs for performing arts organisations of imminent award and salary improvements for entertainment industry employees. Overall in this area the coalition has broken a series of promises and abolished a number of arts initiatives of the former government. It has, it is true, implemented some of its more modest arts promises, but by taking funding from elsewhere&mdash;and their value falls well short of the cuts and the promises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One area that is very important to the arts is the Australia Council. The Liberals promised to continue to recognise and support the Australia Council as the primary administrator of Commonwealth arts funding. Regrettably, this recognition and support did not extend to funding which has been cut by $15.5 million over four years, according to the government's own budget forward estimates, but they continue to fudge it. This is despite Senator Alston's claim that on paper it might look as if the Australia Council is losing money. I can assure you the Treasurer knows that it is, but in fact the minister said it is not&mdash;that it is losing a responsibility commensurate with the amount going elsewhere. That is simply untrue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Major Organisations Board, which comes under the aegis of the Australia Council, provides triennial funding for 17 major arts companies throughout Australia. Again, the Liberals said, when in opposition, that a coalition government will at least maintain the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> existing level of financial support for the Major Organisations Board. The Major Organisations Board has been spared most of the cuts but even it loses $250,000 this financial year. There are cuts across the board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are cuts to the National Museum of Australia and there are very substantial cuts to the film industry. The film industry remains one of the favourite targets, along with the Australia Council, of the Liberals and the National Party when in government. They have done it before and they will do it again. There have been cuts of up to 20 per cent in some of the organisations and the film agencies will not be able to produce as they have in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been a couple of really miserly cuts in this budget to education lending rights and public lending rights for authors. As part of its Creative Nation statement, the Labor government moved to extend the 22&hyphen;year&hyphen;old public lending rights scheme, which provides very modest royalties to authors for the public lending of their books to include educational libraries. That is being scrapped. Also, the public lending rights scheme was altered by stealth. The minister did not announce it. Payments to descendants of authors have been abolished as have payments of less than $50. From next financial year, payments will only be made for the borrowing of books published in the last 25 years&mdash;mean and miserly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now discover, no thanks to the minister, that Artbank, which was actually set up by the Liberals, is the subject of a scoping study towards its eventual sale or privatisation&mdash;something rejected in the visual arts community, which was not even given the courtesy of being informed, that one of the nation's most important cultural assets, the $9.5 million art collection of Artbank, was in jeopardy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Time does not permit me this evening to go into detail about the effects on women, particularly, of many budget measures but many of my colleagues will have covered these in other ways. I simply want to say that if members opposite wish to suggest to members on this side or to the public that they have a mandate which we should allow to progress then I say to them: live up to the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4359"> mandate that you called for, live up to the promises that you made. Those promises were to maintain funding for the environment, to maintain funding for the arts and improve it and to ensure that women had a continuing place in our society. By any measure, in my portfolio responsibility areas you have betrayed all of those promises and the mandate you had has been blown completely away.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I deal with Appropriation Bill (No. 1) I will make some very brief comments on the previous contribution to this debate by the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence). I would like to remind the shadow minister for the environment that we would, as a government, very much like to maintain our core promises in the environmental area and we would like the assistance of the Labor Party, including the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) who makes some of these decisions, to support the passage of the national heritage bill and therefore the sale or the partial sale of Telstra in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is only with that partial sale that the Commonwealth can afford to maintain its promises in the area of the environment. Without those changes, without the partial sale of Telstra, it is the Labor Party, the opposition, which is stopping us from keeping our core promises in the environmental area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like many of my colleagues on this side of the House, I take great pleasure in speaking on the first coalition budget to be handed down in 14 years. It has already proven to be one of the best received in many years. That a good majority of Australians would regard this budget favourably comes as no  surprise to me and I am sure no surprise to the Labor Party. Australians know a very good thing when they see it, and this budget is definitely that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australians are also very quick to recognise a phoney&mdash;and we have seen plenty of them since budget night, scurrying around the opposition benches and back rooms trying to work out what sections of this bill they could oppose to gain a few votes. Having found this bill to be sound, they have since sought to misrepresent the facts for fear that their lack <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of voice would marginalise them still further than they have been already.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just recently we have seen the ultimate in political sleight of hand. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) has announced his own cuts to our budget cuts. It is as if he is still practising to be the Treasurer or perhaps hoping for a second stint as Minister for Finance possibly under the member for Hotham (Mr Crean)&mdash;a position in which he proved utterly incapable of performing during his previous tenure.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Although maybe the member for Batman might stop the member for Hotham getting there before it is too late for the member for Batman. That remains to be seen. The leader's cuts are too little too late. It would have been more appropriate to have announced before the election his intention to cut the nearly $19 billion with which he now acquiesces. That of course would have required him coming clean about the economic picture&mdash;something which the previous government and the previous Minister for Finance were loath to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those days of sweeping Australia's economic problems under the rug are over thanks to one of the initiatives that is contained in this budget. The charter of budget honesty will put paid to any illusion that a government has performed responsibly when in fact it has merely cooked the books like the previous Labor government. Australians want and deserve a higher standard from their government and they are going to get it from us in the Liberal Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those opposite have clearly learned little from the pummelling handed out to them last autumn. Their modus operandi has not changed. They have analysed the savings plan of the Treasurer and decided they can score a few points, perhaps win a few votes, by pandering to special interest groups. There is scant regard for fiscal honesty or responsibility. Then again, as they showed little of that during their 13 years in government, abandoning the economic rudder completely in a callous attempt for re&hyphen;election, it should come as no surprise to us in the government.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4360">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The good news for us and for the Australian people is that someone has their hand back on that rudder and the better news is that it is the coalition that now steers this ship of state. Indeed the Australian people have responded well to our first budget in a very long time. Despite the gloom and doom prophesied in some sections of the media, the measures have impacted very well with the people. While the pre&hyphen;budget speculation raised some angst in the electorate, the response since the Treasurer announced his budget has been measured optimism. The bad news for those opposite is that their attempts to whip up a frenzy have failed miserably.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As history unfolds, the 1996 election may well have seen a sea change in the attitudes of Australian voters. In turning away from Labor, the people snapped the dependency cycle. They did so not in support of some economic rationalist ideal but because they could see the commonsense approach of the coalition would help them as individuals, families and as Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In short, the budget delivers on the campaign promises we made. If those opposite fail to see that, I suggest they blow the cobwebs on their own campaign promises and square those with what they now propose. They would certainly be poles apart. Australians expected change when they elected a Howard government. They demanded an end to the division created by the previous government. They demanded a fair go. This budget delivers that and the people know it. The overriding perception of this budget is that it is fair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That perception is a reality. When governments embark on an exercise of reducing debt and restoring balance there needs to be some belt tightening. Responsible governments ensure that everyone tightens a notch rather than squeezing one section of our community. There have been criticisms from those opposite that this is not the case. They judge government initiative purely in terms of money spent. We on this side of the chamber judge them on what they succeed in accomplishing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One such area where we are looking for better results is in employment, education, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> training and youth affairs. These four entities are inextricably linked and the success of our endeavours in these areas will have long and lasting effects and a real bearing on the type of nation we become in the 21st century. Employment, or lack of it, is central in the lives of Australians. I am disappointed that the shadow minister for employment and training is leaving the chamber as I reach that section of my speech dealing with employment, education and training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Twenty&hyphen;five years ago we regarded an unemployment rate of 1&half; per cent as full employment. Time and technology, a changing work force with changing needs, and arcane industrial relations practices have caught up with us. Where once economists viewed inflation and unemployment as concurrent impossibilities, recent experience has shown that they do co&hyphen;exist. We may have slayed the inflation dragon, or at least checked its progress, but unemployment has become an all too permanent part of our national economy. There are young people of working age who have grown up in households knowing no other income than government assistance, where the idea of aspiring to a job, then a better job and perhaps a career, is totally foreign. This is hardly news, and perhaps that in itself is part of the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition is taking a coordinated approach to see that young people are truly prepared for the job market. One of the major initiatives in this regard is the new system for apprentices and trainees. It is a sad fact that apprenticeships have declined over the years. The modern Australian apprenticeship and traineeship system will reverse that trend, providing $206 million over four years to assist employers to provide real jobs and training for our young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new scheme will not be restricted to traditional trades, but will focus on newer areas such as technology, information and service industries. Employers will have their say in the types of skills and training required and the training arrangements will be quite flexible. The new apprenticeship and traineeship system, as well as the jobs pathway guarantee and enterprise education, will <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4361"> provide a link between secondary schools and workplace training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The career path for many begins in the early years of schooling. Basic skills such as literacy and numeracy are in dire need of attention and, to this end, the budget provides a 50 per cent increase in these areas. Every child leaving primary school should be skilled in reading, writing and spelling and should be able to communicate at a reasonable level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Changes to the higher education sector have been well documented and have been unfairly criticised in some quarters. The nay&hyphen;sayers have reviled the efforts of this government and, in particular, Senator Vanstone. She has been pilloried in the media and by those who have not taken the time to consider the facts. The minister will push on regardless, as she has the courage of her convictions and believes that changes are vital for the higher education sector and the nation at large.</PARA>

An example of the new priorities is the 4,000 HECS&hyphen;free scholarships that will aid people from rural and remote areas, indigenous students and students from low socioeconomic backgrounds. This will particularly be the case in areas such as the electorate of the honourable member for Maranoa. These will be a bonus for those whose current circumstances would otherwise necessitate the curtailing of their education.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The taxpayers of this country, many of whom have had no direct contact with our universities, finance higher education. They derive benefit from the system only when their investment produces qualified graduates who contribute to the Australian work force. All Australians, whether attending university <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> themselves or not, will benefit from the proposed changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The years of so&hyphen;called free education produced no extra benefits to the community. Rather, it proved a drain on public money and that is why Labor introduced HECS. Even so&mdash;even after all those changes&mdash;it is still the top 20 per cent that derive most benefit from education, in fact, more than five times that of the bottom 20 per cent of households. Still, those opposite seem to argue that it is fair that taxpayers subsidise those who will go on to a career fast track and join the very high income earners. And all of the noise made by some sections of academia does not obscure the fact that Commonwealth funding for higher education operating grants and research will increase by more than $50 million by next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Vanstone has said, members of the university community are amongst the most privileged in our society. There are too many Australians for whom the prospect of a tertiary education is still well out of reach. Formal education, training and learning ceases far too early in the lives of too many Australians. For many of these, a career means the unemployment queue, a pay rise merely a cost of living adjustment in jobsearch.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We want to change that, and this bill sets in place a series of meaningful reforms to the system. Many people have wondered about the value in registering for work at the CES and then having to traipse around to the Department of Social Security and wait in line to sign up for financial assistance. The one&hyphen;stop shop approach will mean that is no longer the case. The Commonwealth service delivery agency will deliver assessment, referral and income support services. The agency will be commissioned to ensure that those needing help finding a job will be trained to be job ready. Programs for programs sake will be no more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new guidelines will mean fairer access to help. Those who come through the doors of the CSDA will be assisted in finding a job, whether they are receiving income support or not. I have heard many complaints from people who have identified that which they wish to do but are deemed ineligible for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4362"> because they have not been on this or that program long enough. I heard one person, who was justifiably angry at the failures of the system, refer to jobsearch as the `youth pension'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget offers hope, but it offers more than a false dawn to job seekers. The object will be to find education and training opportunities for our young people and, eventually, sustainable jobs. Not only will the young benefit from the reworking of assistance to the unemployed: this bill recognises that unemployment affects Australians of all ages. The new approach will be to focus on the needs of the unemployed rather than trying to find a program fitted to a profile. Australia must offer more promise than the opportunity to line up for a handout each fortnight. Our labour market assistance, when fully implemented, will provide meaningful assistance to job seekers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many other aspects of this bill that are good news for Australians. The rebate for those who take up private medical cover is a practical approach to stem the tide of those leaving the private companies. At the same time, it makes good sense to impose a levy on those who can afford private health cover and choose not to join a fund, like the former Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shabby attempt to pin the latest price rise for private medical insurance on this government has not been received well in the community. I am sure that the shadow minister for health, the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee), will deal with that in his speech. People will remember that the former Prime Minister snubbed the private funds, recommended that people stay away from them and, to add insult to injury, appointed the member for Fremantle as the health minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders is an issue that continues to concern all of us. To that end, I am very happy to say that $24 million has been allocated over the next four years to improve the health of our indigenous peoples. Under the coalition there will be a deal more planning and strategy involved than under the previous government. We are taking a targeted approached to the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> delivery of health services to increase their effectiveness. New partnerships between governments, health care professionals, community based and mainstream providers and the communities themselves will identify priorities and help improve the lot of our indigenous people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the benefits of sound economic management, as evidenced by this appropriation bill, is the stability of interest rates. Reducing our debt has meant that interest rates have come down and that has already helped families with mortgages and it has aided small business. Small business came in for more than its fair share of the load under Labor. Already we have moved to allow a deferral of capital gains tax for those who are selling their business and buying another of a similar ilk. Of course, $500,000 from the proceeds of that will be exempt to help fund retirement. Combined with a reduction in the provisional tax uplift factor and the impending reduction in the paperwork requirements, small business is coping extremely well with this change of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the budget that an in tune Labor Treasurer would have loved to deliver. It takes a little off the top from the tax benefits of superannuation contributions of high income earners. It provides assistance to those with children through the family tax initiative. It provides some real help to those seeking a better education and a job. It is fair, it is equitable and it reduces debt. Sadly, it is so long since those opposite came up with any cogent policy that it has become far too difficult for them, even for the former garrulous member for Holt, the shadow Treasurer (Mr Gareth Evans). I have always respected the intellect of the honourable member, so I listened intently to his speech on this bill. He conceded that Australia is on the right track with superannuation, but that was it. He found nothing else positive to say. He spent his entire time at the dispatch box running down our initiatives&mdash;all of them&mdash;without making a single alternative proposition other than leaving things as they were.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure that the Labor Party is very disappointed with the shadow Treasurer and the metamorphosis that has overcome him <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4363"> since he came down from the Senate because he clearly, like so many other people who have come from the Senate to the House of Representatives, has not coped as well as he would have hoped in the Labor Party. He is in mourning at the change of government, a change of chamber and a change of portfolio and has clearly become the man without a plan. For the rest of  them it is easier to criticise, to incite the protest, to distort as a justification for opposing and to tell themselves that the people have swung their support from the coalition government and back behind them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This year, as is often the case when a government falls, there has been a raft of members making first speeches in this place. The member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) gave her maiden speech last week and devoted most of her allotted time to scattered attacks on multiculturalism, immigration, foreign aid and our indigenous people. Multiculturalism and reconciliation with our indigenous people are two of the major achievements in the last 15 years of this parliament. Naturally, there has been much debate in this place over ways and means of achieving these aims. Foreign aid and immigration levels have risen or dropped depending on circumstances, and those fluctuations too have occasioned debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Though there may be many sticking points that divide us over these issues, no fair&hyphen;minded Australian would argue their overall value. I am no fan of great political correctness, but if supporting the basic ideals of justice and humanity are considered politically correct, I stand accused. I am a Liberal and an independent thinker; the member for Oxley is merely an Independent. She quoted Paul Hasluck out of context to suit her own purposes and she cited Arthur Calwell on immigration. While Calwell made a contribution over many decades to this parliament, he will never be remembered for his foresight on the issue of immigration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Oxley claims to represent the views of her electorate. I make the very same claim. I can safely say that the vast majority of people in Sturt would be horrified by many of her comments. Then again, it could be that the people of Sturt and the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people of Oxley have a very different outlook, revealing the very same diversity that the member finds so abhorrent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australian governments have made many mistakes since Federation, perhaps none bigger than the White Australia policy. It has taken years to restore our reputation internationally in the wake of the damage done by that longstanding travesty. I would think it regrettable if in some foreign newspaper there appeared a small syndicated story reporting the tawdry and repugnant comments of the member for Oxley, leaving the reader to garner serious misconceptions about our nation. I would be very sad indeed if I thought more than a handful of Australians shared her sentiments.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are used to the honourable member for Sturt patting himself on the back. Once again, he has done it tonight. I wish to pick him up on two issues&mdash;firstly, his comments about the honourable member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). I agree with most of the remarks that he made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to disagree with the member for Sturt about his comments about the claim that the government has increased assistance to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, especially in the area of health. The honourable member, through no fault of his own, is quoting budget documents that claim that the government is spending an extra $24 million on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health. In the fine print, if the honourable member checks with the office of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron), he will find out that the additional funding is actually coming from an efficiency dividend which has been levied on all of the existing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health programs. In particular, the 35 new Aboriginal medical services appear again to be funded by an efficiency dividend cut on the existing Aboriginal medical services.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4364">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, while it is true that an initial reading of the budget documents suggests that there is an extra $24 million for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health, when you go back and get the figures it turns out that, unfortunately, things are falling back and there is a little bit less money being spent this year on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health than was the case last year. My colleague might care to check my claims in his own party room. If he is not happy, and funding has been increased in this area that concerns him, he might raise it internally through his own processes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, I would never allege that the honourable member had deliberately misled the many thousands of listeners who are out there tuned into the Parliamentary and News Network. But it is a quite serious issue because the funding for these programs in many cases really do make a difference to the lives of many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning to the first budget of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Treasurer (Mr Costello), I think that we are entitled to make a few comments. The first thing we can claim is that this first budget of this new government is dishonest. There are 27 major election promises that have been broken. It is also an unfair budget because it hits low income earners and the unemployed the hardest. This budget betrays the millions of Australians who believed the Prime Minister and his ministers when they told us that their highest priority would be unemployment and that they specifically would be focusing on youth unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that Mr Howard, the Prime Minister, has betrayed those millions of Australians on that issue because so many of the employment programs simply will not continue. This budget slashes billions of dollars away from those essential training programs.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr LEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, Ross Gittins, in one of his excellent articles in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> , last week outlined the benefits that flow from those training programs to people who have been out of work for a long time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget also betrays the millions of Australians who believed the Prime Minister's promises that people's pensions and their entitlements would be maintained. He said that they would be no worse off. He also said that regional Australia would be a priority. On all of those counts this budget breaches the undertakings that were made before the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were big promises in health as well&mdash;the public system would not be cut to pay for private subsidies for private health insurance and Medicare will be retained in its entirety. These promises have also been broken. Also, a whole series of cuts has been made in the health portfolio that we think are quite simplistic. There are cuts aimed at doctors' incomes, which will really hit patients. There are cuts aimed at state governments, which will really hit patients who are waiting to get treatment at public hospitals. There are federal funding cuts aimed at state dental programs, which will really hit those who cannot afford $200 an hour for private dental care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The meanness and unfairness of this budget for the sick and those on low incomes is made worse by the government's attitude and its philosophy on cuts to health care. Given the background of the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge), we are entitled to think that he would do better than has been achieved in this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps the biggest concern is the overall philosophy which this government has adopted in putting together their first budget. It is very similar to the three or four budgets that have been put together by the Kennett government in Victoria.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="SCOTT" NAMEID="YT4">

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr LEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Maranoa interjects across the table&mdash;almost on cue&mdash;about the budget surplus. What is dictating the formation of the Howard first budget and the budgets that have been put together by Kennett in Victoria is the philosophy that budget surpluses are more important than hospital beds. They are saying that it is more important that you have the largest possible budget surplus than making sure that your own local hospital has sufficient funds and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4365"> resources to treat the people who live in our local areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just last week the Director of Emergency Care at St Vincent's went public and said that it was inhumane the way people were having to wait on trolleys at that great public hospital in the city of Melbourne. The director said that it was inhumane that people were having to wait two or three days in the emergency casualty ward before they could find a bed for them in that major teaching hospital. Yet in the very same week that there was criticism of the inhumane treatment of patients at St Vincent's, Treasurer Stockdale in Victoria brought down a budget with a massive surplus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Treasurer Costello's strategy is exactly the same. In this budget he is prepared to make massive cuts in federal funding to public hospitals, on top of the neglect and reductions that have been made by state Liberal governments across the country. At the same time, this Treasurer claims that he will deliver a huge surplus in three years time. It is our view that this government has its priorities totally wrong. After all, what is more important&mdash;Peter Costello's surplus or your local hospital? That is the question that people out there should be asking. We think that this philosophy is unfair, and the execution of this philosophy is also naive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to turn to private health insurance, which is an issue that forms the centrepiece of the Liberal Party's health policy. The coalition, after 13 years in opposition, believed that this was the panacea for all of the ills in our national health care system. After 13 years in opposition&mdash;all through the Peacock&hyphen;Howard, Peacock&hyphen;Hewson, Downer&hyphen;Howard years&mdash;they were telling us to give subsidies to people with private health insurance; if we encouraged more people to take out private health insurance this would solve all the difficulties with the Australian health system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what do they do? In this budget they bring down a measure that gives a tax break of $1.7 billion to the private health insurance industry. Dr Wooldridge said on budget night that he would ensure that the full benefit of that tax rebate remained in the pocket of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> contributors. Yet, within days of the budget coming down, the funds announced increases in their premiums, which in some cases completely swallow up the rebate some 10 months before the rebate takes effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So on the one hand the government has given this $1.7 billion tax break, and on the other the health funds are taking back that rebate through increases in their premiums. After years of the Liberal Party's saying that these tax breaks for the health insurance industry would increase the number of people in private health insurance, the minister has said that his aim is not to get an increase anymore. He is not aiming at the target of trying to get 40 per cent of people in private health insurance. His aims today are much more modest. Now he claims he is simply trying to stabilise the percentage of the population with private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have now learnt that spending that $1.7 billion in providing this tax break&mdash;something that is claimed will make a fundamental difference to our health service&mdash;is really just a handout to the private health insurance industry. You have to ask yourself whether it would have been better to have spent that $1.7 billion directly on public hospitals. Would we have been able to ensure that more Australians could have been treated in public hospitals, or in private hospitals for that matter? Would we have been able to ensure that more Australians could have been treated speedily when they were in need of health care if we had used that money directly in assisting treatment at hospitals right across the country?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On budget night the minister for health told us that he was going to ensure that the full benefit remained in the pockets of contributors. A few days later, a storm erupted as a few of the funds started to increase their premiums. It was only through questioning in this House that it was revealed that the minister for health did in fact know all along. The Prime Minister was making public statements at the end of August condemning a junior official in the Department of Health and Family Services for approving these increases and not telling the minister, yet last week we found out that in fact the minister <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4366"> had known all along. The minister has said that it would have been patently stupid for him to have told the Prime Minister that he did know about at least one of the health funds increasing their premiums.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So at the end of last week's sittings, we were left in the position of the Prime Minister having intervened, established a Productivity Commission investigation&mdash;an inquiry&mdash;and told the minister that in future he will have to personally improve all applications for increases in health insurance premiums. The Prime Minister says they will have to go across his desk for approval because he thinks it is so important to seek to minimise the loss of the tax rebate, yet the minister in question time was saying it is all a beat&hyphen;up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If it is such a beat-up, why did the Prime Minister of Australia intervene? Why did the Prime Minister of Australia establish the inquiry? If it is a beat-up, why did the Prime Minister of Australia say that in future he personally would have to approve premium increases?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 30 August, the Prime Minister also issued a plea to the health funds not to apply for any further increases in premiums between now and February or March when the inquiry reports. Yet last week, again, Medibank Private was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> as having applied for increases of at least 10 per cent in its premium rates. That will swallow up about $190 for families who have top cover. That is quite a sizeable proportion of those families who are eligible for the health insurance tax rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the government's own fund ignores the Prime Minister, you have to ask yourself whether the Prime Minister's intervention was in fact a confidence trick. If Medibank Private, the government's own fund, pays no attention to the Prime Minister's appeal, that makes it clear that it has all been a complete con.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The implementation of the policy has been a shambles. You really have to ask whether or not the government's theory behind this policy is based on correct logic. It is my view that, if you look at some of the work that has been done in this area, the assumptions that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have been made in putting together this policy have really been proven to be quite wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year the Commonwealth and the states jointly investigated and attempted to estimate the cost to the states of a two per cent fall in the rate of private health insurance. That committee, which was made up primarily of state government representatives, agreed that the additional cost to the states of that two per cent reduction of people in private health insurance was between $45 million and $164 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition is spending $600 million a year in a tax break to private health insurance to fix at worst a $150 million problem. Certain undertakings were made before the last election. Dr Wooldridge said that the incentives&mdash;that is, the tax rebates for private health insurance&mdash;would not be funded from the public hospital system or grants to the states, yet $800 million has been taken away from public hospitals in this budget. That is, $800 in federal funding for public hospitals around the country has been slashed in this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Public hospitals have been cut in two ways. They have been slashed by $313 million over four years through massive cuts to the direct grants to the states, the hospital funding. In addition, there have been indirect cuts in the financial assistance grants to the states. If you look at a pro rata component for health, that adds up to $450 million. So that total of $800 million, which has been slashed from public hospital funding, could have been used to maintain 1,000 beds in public hospitals across the country, or it could have been used to fund 66,000 operations for ordinary Australians right across the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this government and its minister for health, Dr Wooldridge, are out there cutting $800 million out of public hospitals, I make the claim that Dr Wooldridge must be the only doctor in the country who thinks there is too much money in our public hospitals. If we look at what is happening right across the country, public hospitals at the moment are the weakest link in our health system. Public hospitals are the ones that need extra money&mdash;not reduced money&mdash;from this federal government.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4367">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For this reason, we will be seeking to move an amendment to the government's legislation to impose a higher Medicare levy for high income earners who do not have private health insurance. We believe that all the funds raised through this higher levy should provide extra funding for public hospitals. We do this because we think that, if it is good enough for the first increase in the Medicare levy&mdash;thanks to the Howard government&mdash;to be used to buy back guns, it is good enough for the second increase in the Medicare levy to be used to provide extra services in public hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our greatest concern is that, despite the Prime Minister's assurance that Medicare would be retained in its entirety, this government has got Medicare on the slicer at the delicatessen. This government's intention, budget after budget, is to slice away at the value of Medicare and the services that Medicare provides. We have seen in this budget a 66 per cent increase in the maximum in patient payment for rebates; that has gone up to $50. That is the first slice to be taken off. We have higher gaps for eye and knee operations&mdash;another couple of slices. We have arbitrary limits on psychiatric benefits&mdash;more slices. Then there are the cuts in IVF funding. But perhaps the most sinister of all, there is the freeze on, or the failure to increase, GP fees for inflation&mdash;an amount that is already leading some GPs to cut back the number of people they bulkbill. So there we have further slices off the Medicare salami.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is in this way that the government seeks to encourage more people to take out private health insurance: you undermine the value of Medicare by slicing away and you cut funding for public hospitals. That is the way you try to establish health care under a Liberal government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also make it clear that we have grave reservations about this government's decision to increase the cost of essential drugs&mdash;not just for pensioners, but also for general patients who need drugs that cost more than $17.20. Those families will be paying more. Therefore, the promise that the Prime Minister made to pensioners that their entitlements would be maintained has been breached. He <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> has increased the cost of pensioners' drugs, without any compensating increase in the pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the budget measure which we believe is&mdash;to quote the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>&mdash;the `cruelest and meanest cut' is the one that abolishes federal funding for the Commonwealth dental health program. That is the program that makes sure that 500,000 low income earners have access to emergency and preventative dental care. I really do think this is a terribly callous decision&mdash;and one that I would hope honourable members opposite who are concerned about the impact of this decision on their constituents might have second thoughts about. Many people out there cannot afford the $200 an hour that it costs to see a dentist in private practice. This program is the one that has made sure that the waiting lists are cut so that people, if they are in pain, can get fair access.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For all of these reasons, we will be opposing certain measures in this budget. We think it is wrong that this government is cutting funding for public hospitals, winding back Medicare, increasing the cost of essential drugs and abolishing the Commonwealth dental health program. We are also strongly opposed to the $26,000 up-front fee for nursing homes; and we are determined to make sure that Australian families with kids in child care get a better deal than the one offered by this budget.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I get on to specific parts of the budget, I will address some points made by the shadow minister for health, the member for Dobell (Mr Lee). I go back three years to 1993 when a lady came to me from a rural community in my electorate to tell me her problem. She did not have private health insurance. Through her GP, she had been referred to the Nambour hospital to have a tonsillectomy. Her throat condition was quite septic. It was being treated with different antibiotics. She was told that there was a 15-month waiting list to have that operation done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So she patiently waited for 15 months, again using different types of antibiotics&mdash;you cannot use the same antibiotics forever; you have to change them. The condition did not <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4368"> get better. So after 15 months and a lot of anguish, a lot of difficulty, she went back to the hospital ready for her operation. She was then told by hospital staff, `I'm sorry, the waiting list has blown out; it's now 4&half; years. So come back in 4&half; years time and you can have your operation.' That is the Medicare system&mdash;the public hospital system that the Labor government presided over at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wrote to the then minister for health in Canberra, Graham Richardson, as well as the minister for health at the state level, trying to get some priority for that patient to have that tonsillectomy done. It is a simple operation, one we all had done as kids. My brother had chronic tonsillitis. He went in to have his out, so they took mine out at the same time. But that was when you could go in and get it done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That lady and her husband had no option but to have that operation done privately&mdash;but, of course, they did not have the money. They paid their Medicare levy, so they thought they had universal health insurance and that it would cover the cost of her operation&mdash;but, no, she could not wait what would have been six years. So she and her husband had to sell their home in this small country town and, with the proceeds of the sale, have the operation done privately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Dobell criticises the government for providing incentives so that people can afford private health insurance. The Labor government drove people out of private health insurance; it was a deliberate policy not to have private health insurance. Former Prime Minister Keating boasted in this House that his coverage under Medicare was sufficient, adequate, appropriate and total. He did not need private health insurance and would not take it out. The member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) when minister for health would not take out private health insurance. They could afford it, but they had confidence in the public system. But what about my couple who had to sell their house to have a simple, routine operation done under the previous government?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is it not important that we encourage people back into private health insurance? The public system cannot handle it. Waiting lists are up <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to 4&half; years for a tonsillectomy and other procedures. Growing up in my time, that was a routine operation which was available to all. The only way that this can be delivered is through a massive injection of funds into the public system or by asking people properly, rightly, to take some responsibility for their own health care, especially if they can afford to so do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) and this government are successful in arresting the decline in the number of people taking out health insurance and reversing it so that people, through the tax incentive, will take out private health insurance and we get a wider spread of people and a wider spread of the risk, then premiums should fall, not rise. If participation rates in private health insurance increase to 60 per cent, as they were when Labor came to power before it abolished tax deductions on private health insurance, then premiums will fall, not rise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Dobell also said that this was a dishonest budget because it was unfair and hit unemployment and training programs. On 12 March, the Treasurer made a statement and announced the Commonwealth budget position. We on this side of the House all recall that, before the election, the then Prime Minister, the then Treasurer and the then Minister for Finance, who is now the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), said that the budget figures were there for everybody to see and that they could not get any later figures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is it not amazing that two days after the election the Treasury and the Department of Finance were able to produce, for the newly sworn&hyphen;in Treasurer, figures which showed that the budget position, instead of being a surplus of $3.4 billion as announced by Labor in May 1995, was a $4.9 billion deficit? What a turnaround&mdash;and the member for Dobell was questioning our budget honesty!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No Treasurer ever again should have to face this situation. I think the people of Australia are sick and tired of governments being elected and saying, `We can't keep our promises. We didn't know how bad the books were.' There is really only one way of fixing <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4369"> that&mdash;and it has been addressed by the government&mdash;and that is through the charter of budget honesty. The Treasurer announced on budget day, 20 August:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before its election defeat on 2 March, the previous Government maintained that the budget would now be in underlying balance. The truth was nearly $10 billion to the contrary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Financial dishonesty of that magnitude undermines public confidence in our political system. We will ensure that it never occurs again.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our Government will enact a Charter of Budget Honesty that will require the government of the day&mdash;ours or any other&mdash;to publish a budget update signed off by the Secretaries to the Treasury and the Department of Finance at the commencement of each Federal Election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA>It cannot be put any more clearly than that. That commitment is given and that commitment follows a model which was adopted in New Zealand under the fiscal responsibility legislation. They require the books to be open to the people before an election and they require it by law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am proud to be part of this budget. I am proud of this budget. I am proud to be part of a government which had the strength, the courage and the conviction to bring down a budget that everybody knew Australia needed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On reflection, I recommend that all members from time to time revisit their maiden speeches. I did that just recently to remind me of my motivation for seeking election to this place. If ever there is an occasion when we get to speak from the heart in this place, it is when they rise for the first time. There is an old proverb which says, `If you don't stand for something, you will fall for everything,' and Labor fell last March and fell hard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been in this place now for seven budgets. During the debate on the 1990 budget I made my maiden speech. I noted a number of things at that time about my electorate specifically and the conditions underlying the economy of Australia at the time. I noted that Fairfax is an electorate where 24 per cent of the people are of retirement age and 25 per cent are of primary or secondary school age. I noted also that, during the life of one parliament, there will be 6,000 students in Fairfax who will reach work force age.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At that time we were just entering the recession that we had to have. Labor was powerless at that time to make a proper fiscal response to our current account deficit. Because of the accord process, Labor could not use fiscal policy to address our problems. Labor was locked into a monetary policy response&mdash;that is, interest rate increases&mdash;when it should have come up with fiscal policy responses to cut the budget deficit. The monetary policy response of jacking up interest rates to soak up excess demand and consumption was wrong. Labor plunged us into the worst recession for 60 years. Businesses failed under the burden of high interest rates, which were around 25 per cent. Unemployment reached over 11&half; per cent, with more than one million people on the dole queues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To bring the gravity of the unemployment position to the notice of Australia, I remember the impact on me when John Hewson stood up in this House and said that, if you stood the unemployed together in a straight line one metre apart, the line would stretch from Melbourne to Newcastle. Labor had to keep interest rates artificially high to prop up the dollar, to protect its level of debt repayment and to prop up the offshore borrowings of Labor's high-flying mates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Each budget since 1990 has been a budget of lost opportunity. Labor has cultivated a culture where individuals were encouraged to become dependent on government. Labor's solution to social problems was to throw money at them. But whose money and at whose expense? It was at the expense of small business and families. It was at the expense of the elderly, the retirees who were the workers and savers of previous generations. It was at the expense of our kids and their kids and even the yet unborn generations who will have to pay back the accumulated Labor debt of 13 disastrous Keating years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are no excuses. The Labor government could not say that it did not know. In 1986, only three years into his term, Keating made his now famous banana republic statement. He warned Australians that the debt path we were on would lead us down the road of financial destruction. What did he do about <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4370"> it? For the next 10 years he continued on exactly the same path.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZT4">Mr SOMLYAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The foreign debt that the private sector holds came about largely by the fact that the Commonwealth was such a large borrower in the domestic market. To borrow money, the private sector was forced to go offshore.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The family unit suffered under Labor. Real wages fell. Interest rates blew out. Family mortgages reached 17 per cent. People lost their jobs. Mums were forced out of their homes into part-time jobs to make up the $400 a month increase in mortgage payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After the 1986 banana republic statement, Labor should have attacked the problem of debt and the current account. Labor won the 1993 election by deceit, by political fraud. But there was no such luck in 1996. Everybody by this time was fed up. They got sick of Labor's lies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The business sector was burdened with an unworkable, complicated and inefficient tax regime. Labor kept expanding the tax tentacles to suck up more and more revenue for their mad, frenzied, spending spree. What they could not raise by increased taxes, they borrowed in our collective names. I mention the capital gains tax and the fringe benefits tax. The capital gains tax, which was a tax we were not ever going to have according to Prime Minister Bob Hawke, was introduced after the following election. The capital gains tax and the fringe benefits tax were supposed to be taxes for specific purposes, but the tentacles of these taxes were broadened year after year to bring in amounts of revenue that are mind-boggling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently I tabled a report in this House by the Joint Public Accounts Committee. That report showed that the compliance cost of taxation to people in Australia is between $3 billion and $6 billion. Just that micro-economic reform of reforming the tax system will be a major assistance to business in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After fighting an election against the GST, Treasurer Dawkins raised sales tax by two per cent. By stealth, Labor introduced their own <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> GST by broadening the base of the inefficient wholesale sales tax. Tax is stifling small business. In my electorate of Fairfax, the people hardest hit by Labor were families; the elderly; small business; the young, who had no hope of getting a job; and, of course, rural people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Governor-General's speech for the opening of this parliament&mdash;when he spoke about the vision of this government in its first term&mdash;he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is a society rich in resources of all kinds. We should not have to settle for a lower level of economic performance than other countries with fewer advantages. The government's policies aim to fulfil people's aspirations by rewarding hard work and initiative, achieving rising living standards, affordable home ownership, and a more positive future for our children.</PARA>
<PARA>The Governor-General went on to speak about jobs, growth, opportunities and living standards. The other areas identified that were obviously neglected under the previous Labor governments were families, the community and the elderly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was also a section in that address to the parliament about young Australians, the devastation of youth unemployment and how youth unemployment mushroomed among Labor governments. He also spoke about regional Australia, defence, international relations and trade. These are the areas identified as being the big sufferers under Labor, and these are the areas which the budget is set to redress.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most valuable asset that any country has is its people and its families. There has been a redistribution of income towards families. Families have suffered under Labor, and that has now been redressed by the family tax package and also the private health insurance initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More important is national savings. This is a savings budget. It is a total reversal of previous Labor government budgets. This is a budget which will produce national savings. Our foreign debt can be paid off only with the savings of Australians. As I said, I am proud to be part of a government which had the intestinal fortitude to bring down this budget <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4371"> at a time when every Australian knows it is entirely necessary.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(9.31 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking about this budget, I am on the record as saying that, in my view, it is a saleable budget. It is a clever budget. I believe it is a budget that in many aspects the Labor Party should have brought down. When you think about it, the budget did not have to be all that good to get the support that it got, because the media and the financial press were desperate to be able to support it. A mediocre effort would have got support, and I think they were very pleased they had such a saleable commodity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) was particularly naive in his indignant criticism about the broken promises. The reality is that most Labor followers supported the broken promises&mdash;certainly the prominent promises and the ones which the Leader of the Opposition concentrated on. So there was no political advantage in that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Was it a good budget? I think not. It was a budget with a lot of merit. There has been some redistribution towards families; that is true. But will it attack the underlying problems of Australia? The answer is no. I venture to say now that, at the end of the next financial year, unemployment will be no better. If it is better, it will be only marginally better and it could possibly be worse. I will also warrant that the current account deficit will be no better, and almost certainly higher.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Former Senator Walsh is regarded by many as probably the best economist either side of politics has seen in a long time. He had a dictum. The Walsh dictum was simply this&mdash;keep the lawyers away from the money. That is very sound advice. From my experience and my observation of lawyers, I have found that they are not good treasurers. They tend to be opinionated, they tend to be arrogant and they tend to carry a brief regardless of the facts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you looked through history, you would find that that was true of the current Prime Minister, John Howard. I remember a lovely little anecdote a journalist told me. When she was going to Treasury back in the days when Howard was Treasurer, she said to Treasury <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> officials, `You will have to excuse me; I don't really know much about economics.' They replied, `That's quite all right, nor does the Treasurer.' You have the same thing with the present Treasurer (Mr Costello)&mdash;that arrogance, that opinionation and that ability to carry a brief. I do not know whether they go to the nub of the real economic problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the contrary, the member for Gellibrand, Ralph Willis, made a very studied speech in this place on the budget. I think Ralph Willis is technically a very good economist; he certainly has a far greater grasp of economics than the current government frontbench. But I think Ralph Willis, too, misses the boat because he, like the Liberal Party, missed the main point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth is that, in the fundamental issues, there is simply no difference between the major political parties today. The main point which was missed by all is that neither political party today has an industry policy. Without an industry policy, there is going to be no end to the current account deficit and no end to unemployment. Yet neither party has it. You would expect that from the Liberal Party perhaps. But from the Labor Party, it is an aberration and a travesty. It is something for which the blame can probably be laid at Keating's door. I believe that Ralph Willis does understand this; he simply never had the ability to force his views over those of Keating, a man whose damage will rebound to the Labor Party for many, many years to come.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my 20 minutes I want to concentrate on three points of necessary correction in the budget&mdash;the first is taxation and its effect on small business. Small business is very important to the community. What the government has offered small business is a sop. I will warrant that in a year's time small business will not see where the 25 per cent reduction of paperwork has come from. They will be asking, `25 per cent of what?' Small business will not get a lot of support from this budget and, until the government is prepared to revamp the taxation system entirely, small business is on a hiding to nothing. We will see a continuation of policies of support for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4372"> big business, policies which have emanated from both sides of this House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have to look at the fringe benefits tax, and you certainly have to look at the capital gains tax. The truth is that big business does not pay capital gains tax&mdash;small business does. I believe it would be in the national interest to largely sweep away capital gains tax, especially in relation to small business. I believe it should still be possible to stop employees&mdash;mainly employees of large businesses&mdash;from taking income as capital gains.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to talk about what I thought was a very silly inclusion in the budget&mdash;that is, in relation to section 23PA of the tax act, the exemption on the sale of mining leases. Some years ago, the Keating government commissioned the Gutman inquiry into the goldmining industry. It was a predictable inquiry. Keating appointed Mr Gutman because he knew he was from the school of thought that could see no reason why gold should not be taxed. Gold was just another commodity. I fought very hard at the time. I knew that, if gold had been taxed in 1986, it would have been very detrimental because that is a very emotional industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember arguing with Keating and Hawke about this. I said that, if they left gold alone, as an export it would earn more than a billion dollars. `What nonsense,' said Keating. `I have talked to experts. I have talked to Western Mining. I have talked to my department. Gold will peak at $800 million.' Gold was then worth $350 million, maybe $400 million as an export. Gold of course went to $4.25 billion and is perhaps our second biggest export.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hawke understood it; Keating never did. I had to work very hard to hold off that gold tax. I do not think there is any doubt that, but for my efforts and the efforts of Julian Grill&mdash;a state member in Western Australia&mdash;there would have been a gold tax in 1986, 1987 and 1988. We held it off until 1991, with the years from 1988 to 1991 being tax deductible in expenditure. But Mr Gutman said that section 23PA of the tax act should be left for very good reasons. He actually understood the industry and he understood the lead time <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> needed for the development of new mines. He understood that, if you ran down exploration, a time would come when there was no new development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has been happening in the goldmining industry is that because mining exploration has been largely brownfield sites it has proceeded, but that must come to an end. When we get into greenfield sites and we hit the inevitable barrier of native title, compounded by the lack of incentive due to the withdrawal of this tax exemption, we could get into a real problem with the industry&mdash;the industry which is today Australia's second biggest export and growing very rapidly. We need to be finding and identifying two million ounces every couple of months if we are going to sustain the industry at its present level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why did this come about? I think there are basically two reasons. The mining industry, in its usual gutless way, was desperate to hold off the diesel tax. The government had signalled that it was going to remove the diesel tax rebate. The Labor Party looked at this and decided that it would be crazy to do so. The Liberal Party had exactly the same evidence, but it had more. It had an Access Economics study, instituted by the industry, which demonstrated that it was clearly very foolish to do so. But the industry&mdash;so anxious to protect itself when it had every right to expect commonsense from the government&mdash;responded to Treasury's demand for trade&hyphen;offs. The industry said, `Take 23PA because that affects prospectors. It doesn't affect the large mining companies.' They were prepared to sacrifice prospectors, forgetting the long&hyphen;term impact on the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was another factor. Mark Creasey, a prospector, had been spectacularly successful. It said in the papers that he had made a lot of money selling his leases to Mr Gutnick, who did extremely well with them. I think that a lot of credit should go to Mr Gutnick because, when the industry was sitting on its hands and frightened to move, Joe Gutnick was out there exploring and spending money looking for gold and other minerals. I believe that Mr Gutnick has been a tremendous asset to Australia in his determination, his courage and his success.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4373">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my view, Mark Creasey is an Australian hero. What governments seem to forget is that for 25 years Mark Creasey had been out there searching for gold. He was broke. I would say he was literally on the bones of his arse. He was a man who had to worry about how he was going to afford a new tyre.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Quick)" NAMEID="10000">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="10000">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Quick)</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order! That is rather unparliamentary. I would ask you to withdraw that remark and rephrase it.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CF4">Mr CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am happy to withdraw it. I had no idea it was unparliamentary. If it is, it should not be. I am happy to withdraw it. I think you get the message that he was very broke and that he was wondering where he was going to get the money for his new tyre. I think that after 25 years he enjoyed that success. It was not spontaneous; it was hard&hyphen;earned. It was 25 years slugging it out in the bush. I think Australia owes him a great debt. In my view, he is a national hero and what he did was in the national interest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another area which is of some concern to me is the overkill with which the government acted against the community based child&hyphen;care services. I am in the process of writing to the minister about this because it seems to me, for several reasons, that the country has been particularly disadvantaged. In mining areas there is a very heavy utilisation of these services. In mining areas people generally have no family support. There is no backup, so there is a greater need. While it is true that mining areas tend to have high wages, they also have very high costs. The net returns are often much lower than those that workers in the city enjoy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, in the mining areas&mdash;in the name of competition, productivity or whatever&mdash;we have gone to 12&hyphen;hour shifts. I was talking to one mining company recently which was a pioneer in seeking 12&hyphen;hour shifts. They told me that, by the end of this year, they are hopeful that they can get the productivity of a 12&hyphen;hour shift back to the level of an eight&hyphen;hour shift. In many cases they would dearly like to move away from it, but they have locked themselves in. Workers now enjoy the lifestyle. It has played havoc with many country towns. Workers have simply bought <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> themselves houses on the coast or on the goldfields moved to Kalgoorlie. They do their four days and then withdraw to their houses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Towns like Kalgoorlie, Hedland, Karratha and a lot of others pay an enormous amount of tax and they get very scant reward for that. I have campaigned long and hard about the running down of infrastructure in country areas. It is about time governments started putting some money back into the country. That is a criticism of both governments. The reality is that, in this budget, there is very little for the country. I am grateful for what there is, but it certainly is not nearly enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another problem is that the community based services are bound by contract to maintain their maintenance&mdash;it is written into their funding&mdash;but private centres are not. They are much more flexible and this puts an additional cost on the community based service. The government has already cut services in the country. Before the budget came out the Department of Health in Western Australia had simply cut its budget by closing down every single office outside the metropolitan area. It was a massive reduction in services: services which had only been provided in the last few years and which had been very effective and very much appreciated&mdash;gone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Community based services also have an obligation to take the nought to two years of age category of children, which is the most expensive. A lot of the private centres simply are not taking these children and, therefore, have an advantage. But by and large their prices are higher. The community based services tend to act as a break on costs and keep things affordable. So I am going to write to the minister and ask that he have another look at it but, given the behaviour of the government, its large majority and its arrogance, I doubt whether my voice will be heard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to touch on funding for Aboriginal affairs because it is an important issue. Aboriginal people in this country are deprived. They should not be because the money provided to them is significant. The member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) is on record as talking about the $1.2 billion that goes <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4374"> annually to Aboriginal affairs. The figure is actually well over $2.2 billion because about $1 billion comes from the states in total. You then have the general services which go to everyone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has happened in Aboriginal affairs? It is a contentious issue for the government. It is quite clear that ATSIC is hostile to the incoming government. It is quite clear that the industry is hostile to the government. What has been the response of this government? I think it is bizarre. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has cut ministerial staff from seven to five. In some departments that may have been acceptable. In Aboriginal affairs it was plain dumb. The government is not going to get any kudos for cutting ministerial staff. In Aboriginal affairs it has been a disaster. You have a minister with an extremely difficult job and the government's response has been to tell him to pick up staff from ATSIC. ATSIC are the enemy of government. In my view, they are the enemy of Aboriginal advancement. They are the pinnacle of the Aboriginal industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the government makes a cut in Aboriginal funding, a relatively small cut if taken over five years, one which could easily be accommodated. But, very foolishly, it left ATSIC to determine where the money was cut. ATSIC will make those cuts in the way which will cause maximum pain and embarrassment to the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the government has done pales into insignificance compared to ATSIC's plans. ATSIC planned to rearrange its funding to fund on a per capita basis. Since most Aboriginal people live in the cities where, in my view, they are in the mainstream and should be relying on mainstream funds, it was going to take the funds away from the country and concentrate them in the cities. This would have meant that communities like those in the Central Reserve and Ngaanyatjarra Council's fund were going to be cut by 20 per cent per year for five years, leaving the funds at 20 per cent of what they now are&mdash;a totally untenable position. This will mean that there will be a massive impact as people come out from these communities to country towns as fringe dwellers. The minister was aware of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this disaster. I think he jawboned the department, for he has very little power to direct it into changing. But I understand now that ATSIC once more is pushing this policy of redirecting its funds to the cities and away from the country, where the funds are needed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had a disgrace in ATSIC. I was watching a TV interview today where the member for Oxley was debating Charles Perkins, who invited her out to the communities. I think it is a good idea but I would not let Mr Perkins hand&hyphen;pick the communities. I would advise the member for Oxley to travel much more broadly. I could take her to communities and show her the appalling conditions that Mr Perkins talks about. But we could ask why, after all these years of funding, this is so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was in Halls Creek recently, where they had just had a riot. I went there the next day to determine what happened. I put the blame for that squarely at the feet of Gerry Hand. Those people came mainly from the community of Balgo. They were desert people. Years ago during the Hand regime nearly $5 million was spent in that area. The community had pleaded for the money to be spent in the community. They wanted a police station. They wanted it manned. They wanted sports facilities. They are living out there in mind-numbing boredom with no controls, the controls which we in white society take for granted. Gerry Hand, at the insistence of ATSIC, against my advice and against the advice of the community, spent the money in outstations. They built four satellite outstations, none of which have ever been used. It was a waste of money from the start.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it is worse than that, because when ATSIC does this to extend its power it imposes on the states another big financial cost&mdash;put in air services, put in roads, provide schools. That is the sort of thing that I believe ATSIC should be accountable for. I thought Mr Perkins's performance on television today was boorish and, frankly, quite dishonest. There is much more that I would like to say about this budget but that is obviously all I have time for. If I said any more, that too might be unparliamentary.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak about the budget. I am pleased to say that this is a rebuilding budget. This is a budget on behalf of a government that did not create the problems but a government that is prepared to fix them. This is the budget that Australia had to have. Let us be honest. This is the budget Australia should have had 10 years ago. Our Treasurer (Mr Costello) has not only broken the debt and deficit cycle; he has been able to give incentive and encouragement to those who have missed out for the past 13 years&mdash;small businesses, families and particularly our youth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am particularly pleased to focus first of all on the budget deficit, which has been turned around. I would like to mention the underlying balance starting with this year and going through to the year 2000. In the year 1995-96 we are looking at a budget deficit of $10.3 billion; in 1996-97 it has been reduced to a $5.3 billion deficit, and in 1997-98 we are looking at a $1.5 billion deficit. In 1998-99 we are looking at a $1 billion surplus and in 1999-2000 a $5.7 billion surplus. Can I say how significant this is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government keeps to its policy and its plan, in five years time this government will have gone back 20 years to the pre-Whitlam days of debt. It will have been able to wind back the debt clock 20 years. To do that in the short space of five years is a remarkable achievement and one which our children and grandchildren will be grateful for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The objective of all this is to improve the level of saving by raising public saving. The opposition have been very loud in their support for debt reduction and improvement in the national savings. But how do they plan to do this? Plainly not by cutting expenditure because in fact there is $19 billion of expenditure they would have left in the budget. How then did they aim to reduce the debt burden for our children and grandchildren and improve the national savings? Are they magicians? I suspect that what they would have done was to increase taxes. That is something that, fortunately, we have been able to avoid doing. In fact, in many cases we have been able to reduce taxes.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Treasurer has taken the hard decisions, not the soft options&mdash;they are only too easy to take. We have seen them over the last 13 years. This government, over time, will not have its hand in the savings pool of this country; it will not be funding its expenditure from private savings in this country. While the opposition lack the courage to take the hard decisions, they have retreated to spoiler tactics. One of the myths that is current at the moment is that there will not be a reduction in interest rates, and we have had that pretty little theory about the twin deficits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a myth buster about and the myth buster, in this case, is the Governor of the Reserve Bank. I refer to the Reserve Bank of Australia 1996 report and financial statements. This is what the Governor of the Reserve Bank has to say about those myths:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ongoing large current account deficit and rising external liabilities are the results of Australia's poor national savings record. The declining level of national saving since the mid&hyphen;1970s reflects mainly lower public sector saving. Gross saving by the public sector averaged almost 8 per cent of GDP in the 1960s and early 1970s but has averaged a little over 2 per cent so far in the 1990s, largely because of lower saving by the Commonwealth government.</PARA>
<PARA>And we know who that was for the last 13 years. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most effective way of raising national saving within a realistic time frame is to move the budget into surplus. International experience shows that structural cuts in budget deficits consistently have a favourable effect on the current account position, even if the timing is difficult to predict.</PARA>
<PARA>I would like to continue with what the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Bernie Fraser, has to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The widespread need for fiscal consolidation has given rise to concern that fiscal policy will unduly restrict economic activity. More generally, the long&hyphen;term effects of fiscal consolidation are clearly positive with higher savings tending to promote economic growth by raising investment and&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>wait for it&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">lowering long&hyphen;term real interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that little myth has been well and truly debunked by somebody who presumably knows what they are talking about. We are seeing the results of that in the recent one&hyphen;half of one per cent drop in interest rates. This <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4376"> represents $70 a month to a family on an average income. I will tell you what it means to the agricultural sector and regional areas. I was very pleased to hear the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) speak about regional areas. A one&hyphen;half of one per cent drop in interest rates represents a saving to the agricultural sector of this country of $90 million a year&mdash;$90 million a year in hard&hyphen;pressed rural economies. That is a sustainable way of assisting families, farmers and small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to continue with some of the other benefits to be gained from this budget. No longer will the government be able to deceive the Australian people as Labor did before the last federal election. You would not choose a car on the figures that we were given, but the Australian people had to choose a government on paltry information. What we intend to do in the government is to introduce an election commitment to be costed 10 days before the lead&hyphen;up to an election and prepared by the secretaries to the departments of Treasury and Finance so that the Australian people will have the facts that they need to hand to determine whether or not a government is worthy to be re&hyphen;elected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the one that particularly appeals to me. There will be an intergenerational report on long&hyphen;run implications of government policies every five years. In other words, we will know whether the policies of government are not only going to be beneficial for our generation but whether we are indulging in intergenerational theft. For anybody in this mighty chamber who has a child or a grandchild that must be heartening news. Other economies, the United States particularly, have looked at intergenerational debt and theft and I am pleased to see that, finally, we have a government in this country with the courage to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now I turn to families and small business. Can I tell you a story that happened before the last federal election. When I was in Sarina, one of our railway towns in the seat of Dawson, I met a railway worker who had seven sons. He is truly blessed&mdash;I think he was probably more blessed than he expected. He raised those boys on a railway worker's wage. He said to me that he would have <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> loved some incentive to help him, that it was a great battle to raise his boys on that average weekly wage. I can imagine it must have been. I am very pleased to see that finally we have a government that is rewarding the true battlers in this country, those who have worked away at a hard job, perhaps on a fairly modest wage, and raised their families&mdash;they have done the right thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Referring to our family tax initiatives, part A provides for an increase in the tax free threshold for one parent of $1,000 for each child. This translates to an increase in disposable income for eligible families of $200 per child per annum. This is available to all families with dependent children and cuts off when the family income reaches $70,000 or more per annum. Families such as that railway worker's family will be significantly better off. I cannot work out the figures for him but it would be close to $1,400 or $1,500 a year&mdash;a wonderful reward for somebody who is doing the right thing and rearing their family in difficult circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this will mean for the seat of Dawson, on the figures we have worked, is that families in Dawson will be better off by $6.2 million every year. They will have in their pocket $6.2 million. This is money for music lessons, perhaps for a family holiday at the end of the year, or perhaps just a way of paying off the mortgage a little bit sooner. That is real and sustainable assistance to families. By July next year, families in Dawson will have $3.1 million more in their pockets&mdash;money that will be spent inevitably and will be a significant boost to small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning to assistance for regional Australia, the diesel fuel rebate is worth $1.3 million to mining and agriculture; there are increases in grants to local government of four per cent; and $150 million in capital gains tax relief, which I find particularly pleasing. Many of the smaller businesses have found that the capital gains tax has been a considerable disincentive to sell their business to trade up to a larger business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, someone on a farm or someone with a small retail business might want to sell to buy another, larger business for an <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4377"> expanding family. Perhaps they have a number of children and they may want some of their children to go into the business. By the time capital gains tax is paid and the tax man takes his hand out of their pocket, they may as well have stayed in the original business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are looking at giving businesses relief from capital gains tax on the sale of a business when used to purchase a like business. Up to half a million dollars from the sale of a small business to fund retirement will also be exempt from capital gains tax. That is a considerable incentive to businesses that are usually a nest egg for retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another plus for business is the provisional tax uplift factor. I must say that it is well named&mdash;it gets lifted up and lifted up. It was eight per cent under the previous government. It will now be reduced to six per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are looking at changing Labor's unfair dismissal laws such that they will be fairer to both the employer and  employee. If there is one thing that I have heard from businesses that is a great disincentive, particularly to employing young people who perhaps do not have a track record in employment, it has been the unfair dismissal laws. Business has been afraid to employ somebody who does not have a reference or a track record in employment because that person might turn out to be an unsuitable employee and the difficulties in trying to relinquish them from their business are simply too onerous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will be looking at assisting those who want to take on apprentices and trainees. More than $1.7 billion will be provided over the next four years, recognising the potential of small business to improve the future for young Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning to transport infrastructure, the budget has allocated $36 million a year to improving dangerous roads with a particular focus on regional areas through the black spots program. This is very welcome in rural areas. There are certainly areas in Dawson where there have been a number of serious accidents simply because of a twist in a road or because a pedestrian crossing or traffic lights may be needed. This is certainly a very welcome opportunity to rectify those difficulties. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rural health has had a particular focus. The John Flynn scholarships will attract more doctors to rural areas and six university departments of rural health will be developed. One of those will be in Mount Isa in the far north-west, which has had the difficulties in attracting medical practitioners ignored for far too long. I know in my own seat there are two small country towns that have had great difficulties in attracting medical practitioners. I am pleased to see the minister for health is looking for opportunities to encourage doctors to move to some of our rural towns or, should I say, to remove some of the attractions of city practices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is increased funding for boarding allowances and secondary and primary school allowances to assist children in isolated areas with education. There is a $20 million fringe benefits tax break on remote area housing. This is very welcome because in many rural areas&mdash;in mining towns and on farms&mdash;it is simply a requirement of the award that accommodation be provided. It has been a considerable difficulty for many of those employers to have to pay fringe benefits tax as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to move on now to our senior citizens. We are maintaining assistance for those who are most vulnerable. The pension will be maintained at 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings. Also, the government will provide self-funded retirees with the same tax rebate as the pensioner rebate. What this means in effect is that in 1997-98 a qualifying single person's tax free level of income will increase from to $5,400 to $11,185 and couples will be able to have a tax free joint income of $19,850. I think it is entirely appropriate that those who have had the foresight and the thrift to set aside funds for their own retirement should be at least given the same opportunities to enjoy a tax free threshold as those on a pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would now like to talk very briefly about changes to Austudy. The Austudy deeming factor will be abolished and applicants will be subject to the means test. An up&hyphen;front calculation of their means will ensure that their actual living expenses can be provided for and application processing will be within three weeks.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4378">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning to tourism, I am very pleased to see that the export market development grants scheme has been not only retained but also extended for tourism operators. They now have full access to the scheme and the full grant&mdash;not just at the 25 per cent level which they had previously but up to 50 per cent. What this will mean for tourist operators in my area is that if they are able to get together in a joint venture arrangement and can spend up to the threshold of $30,000, they will be able to access the full level of grant which all other export industries have been able to access. This is particularly welcome for those areas which are trying to attract additional overseas visitors and are sending promotional material overseas to wholesalers and agents in other countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now turn to apprenticeships. As I have said, there is increased funding for apprenticeships. Over the next 12 months the government will provide almost $260 million to employers of apprentices and trainees through incentive payments and wage subsidies. The number of apprenticeships has fallen dramatically. In Dawson, many employers have said to me that they had an apprentice, they would have liked to have had an apprentice, but it was simply too difficult to keep an apprentice on. This has been reflected Australia&hyphen;wide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the past six years, the number of apprenticeships has fallen from 62,259 to 50,436&mdash;the lowest level in 30 years. It is not surprising that youth unemployment has hit over 50 per cent in some areas. Over $1.7 billion will be provided for the apprenticeship scheme over the next four years. From 1 December 1996, employers will be eligible for a commencement payment of $1,250 for each apprentice or trainee and a bonus payment of $250 for each apprentice or trainee taken on above the previous year's intake. An additional progress payment of $1,250 will be made where a trainee or apprentice progresses to higher skill levels. The living away from home allowance for apprentices is being increased from $39 a week to $70 a week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a budget that, certainly in my electorate, has been very well received. It is a budget for rebuilding, it is a budget for breaking the debt and deficit cycle and giving <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> incentive to those who have waited a long time for it&mdash;small business, families and youth.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When one casts one's mind back to the election in March one recalls how small were the differences between the two competing sides of politics, how the then opposition leader effectively endorsed the then government's policies and programs&mdash;almost totally. We remember all the things that were said then: `Medicare and bulk&hyphen;billing will be maintained.' We also remember that in the month of the campaign they released some 60 documents, comprising probably 1,500 pages and weighing about 10 kilos, and asked people to judge them on those documents. Firstly, most people did not get the documents and could not have done so; secondly, people did not have time to read the documents in the month that was provided; and, thirdly, the then government had no intention of following them anyhow: they were always a smoke screen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the electorate judged that they could afford to take a risk: the risk was very small; the differential between the two parties was minimal. I think it was Noel Pearson who clearly focused on that famous slogan `For all of us'. Throughout the campaign he pointed out that he felt `For all of us' had a subliminal addition to it: `For all of us, but not for them', which is how it turned out to be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now that the coalition has taken over and is governing this country, it is important to look at what that means in two main spheres: social and economic. The Australian economy today is a different one from the one which John Howard passed on in 1983. We have to remember that the present Prime Minister spent some six or seven years as Treasurer. He had a fair go at changing Australia in those years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Between 1983&hyphen;84 and the present there has been a massive change in the socioeconomic nature of this country. To see an example of that, let us look at trade and employment figures in three main areas of trade. Back in 1984, we exported about $9.4 billion worth of mining products. By 1995, that had grown to $19.2 billion&mdash;an increase of 103 per cent. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4379"> But the number of people employed in that sector actually reduced by 10,000, or 10 per cent, because even with all those exports only 82,000 or 83,000 people&mdash;about one per cent of the work force&mdash;were employed in that sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Agriculture is another big export area. In 1984, we exported $8.9 billion worth of agricultural products. This had grown to $19.4 billion in 1995&mdash;a healthy growth of 117 per cent&mdash;with a growth in the work force of just three per cent. The third sector is that of manufacturing. In 1984, that sector had exports of $4.9 billion. By 1995, it had grown to $22 billion&mdash;a growth of 344 per cent&mdash;and there was a decline in the work force of 3.2 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The figures for those three areas show how dramatically we increased our exports. We reduced the work force in mining substantially. We reduced the work force in manufacturing slightly but we had massive increases&mdash;by far the greatest&mdash;in exports. In agriculture there was a slight increase in the work force and a substantial increase in export value.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point of all this is that the nature of production is now so different from what it was. We note that this improved position was left to those 13 years; it should have happened during the 13 years earlier, and certainly the seven years of the previous Liberal government when so little had changed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth looking at some of the other areas&mdash;for example, the coalmining industry. In 1974 there were 24,500 coalminers employed in Australia. That figure grew to 34,000 by 1983-84. By 1994 that had dropped back to 26,000, again because of changes in the source of the coal and the kind of technology we used. In 1974-75 there were 7,000 people employed in the iron ore industry, with the figure reducing to 6,300 by 1995. These are areas of vast development and vast investment. Substantial exports had contracted in terms of work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The point that comes through is that for each $1 billion invested there are a number of jobs involved and for each $1 billion of exports there are a number of jobs involved. The differences are now so great as to suggest that they should be the main focus of govern ment policy. The fact is that there are something like 14 jobs in manufacturing for every one in mining for the same value of exports. There are 14 times as many!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are again focusing on the resources boom. We are seeing this wonderful idea that suddenly mining will be the saviour of the country. I thought we had burnt our fingers enough back in the late 1970s with the resources boom. The fact is that the more we export resources, the more we will  have to import other things and the more jobs we export with those resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth while looking at where the other job changes have occurred. It is interesting to note that in the production of electricity, gas and water the work force declined by 40 per cent between 1983 and 1995. On the other hand, wholesale&hyphen;retail increased by 34 per cent, education increased by 30 per cent, culture and recreation increased by almost 70 per cent, personnel and other services increased by 44 per cent and health and community services increased by 36 per cent. The most substantial of all, however, was property and business services, which increased by 96 per cent. We are not talking about small numbers of jobs; we are talking about substantial numbers. In the wholesale&hyphen;retail area the actual increase in the work force of 440,000 was about four times as many. So five times as many people work in this sector as work in mining altogether. That was the increase alone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note&mdash;we will come back to it later&mdash;where this budget was focused in terms of that jobs growth. If we look at the area of services, we see substantial changes and substantial growth. That is echoed also by tourism, where back in 1983 our exchange earnings in tourism were about $2 billion. It is currently about $14 billion, an increase of 570 per cent. We are currently employing over half a million people in the services industry. It is a valuable import, but it is one of the areas also targeted for savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time there has been a substantial shift in the social dimension of employment, particularly with regard to women. In 1984, 45.5 per cent of women were in the work force. That figure is now 54 per cent, a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4380"> growth of 8&half; per cent in real terms. The work force participation rate&mdash;those people in the whole community who make up the work force&mdash;has grown from 60.5 per cent to 63.5 per cent, a growth of three per cent. We are all very well aware that average weekly earnings for women are substantially lower than for men. Back in 1983 they were 25 per cent lower. That has been reduced to less than 20 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These changes show that the nature of the work force and the nature of society have undergone enormous change&mdash;a sea change in the kind of people working, the kinds of jobs they are working in, the kinds of wages they are getting and the kinds of skills that they bring to those jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A figure that is also worth looking at in the same context is the long&hyphen;term unemployed figure. The result of John Howard's recession in 1983 left a long-term unemployment rate figure of 202,000 people at its height&mdash;that is, people out of work for a year or more. That was equivalent to 3.1 per cent of the total work force of the day. The current figure of 226,000 long-term unemployed equates to 2.7 per cent of the total work force. In other words, whilst the number is high, the actual carryover in work force size is slightly smaller. But the difference is that in 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986 and 1987 the Labor government put in massive programs to support and help the long-term unemployed. What we are seeing today is the opposite&mdash;programs in place being taken away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we look back at that period in the mid-1980s and recall those long-term unemployment figures and look at how hard it was to shift those numbers in terms of helping people back into the work force, we wonder why on earth the government, with that kind of background and information available to it, chooses to do the opposite. When I said the other day that this government has doomed some 200,000 people who will probably never work again, that is the basis of it. That kind of figure should send feelings of shock and horror through most of the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The idea that we are somehow going to have a resources led recovery and a small business led recovery might sound terrific <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> until you actually look at where economic growth is happening or where the jobs come from. The fact is that mining does not feed much into small business at all because it is so intensive in terms of capital equipment. Very few small businesses actually service the mining industry. It is not much of a recycler at all. On the other hand, universities, service areas and tourism do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We would imagine that the thing that we should be doing is helping those areas where there has been job growth and where there is clearly potential and where the transformation of our work force over the last 13 years shows where the changes can occur. What do we see? We see those areas of growth affected, including manufacturing which has been so spectacular. We have had the R&amp;D tax incentive reduced. We have had the shipbuilding bounty wiped out. I am sure you will all recall seeing the manager of Incat, who currently sells $250 million per year worth of ferries overseas. I suggest that he will have to start looking to build somewhere else because that bounty was pretty important to his sales package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen the computer bounty wiped out. That is a very clever one to wipe out. The computer bounty meant that, because we do not make computer chips, our people in the industry were able to import the computer components, develop them, put them together, develop software and/or hardware and re&hyphen;export them. For that there was a bounty. There was encouragement. Of course, now that that is wiped out it means not only that our own people will not be able to do that but also that people like IBM, who were exporting substantially from Australia, may find it now less viable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The export area has been the area of growth. But the government has made cuts to the export market development grants scheme, which is going to hurt exports, particularly tourism. There were also cuts to the famous DIFF program. There were claims that our aid program saw 87&half; per cent of our aid dollars spent in Australia, on Australian products and on Australian personnel. The fact is that the most heavily biased scheme towards Australian companies was the DIFF scheme. The <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4381"> cutting of that is probably going to cost us more than $1 billion a year in sales and all the jobs that go with that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The thought of saving in those areas where there is job growth and where there are changes in the nature of the work force while at the same time expecting that it will lead to economic and employment growth is clearly wrong&hyphen;headed. If the then Treasurer had compared the figures for the 1975 and 1983 period with the 1983 to 1986 period, he would have learnt that he had pulled the wrong reins back in the late seventies with that wrong&hyphen;headed approach to the resources boom.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to touch on the social direction of this government, which is pretty fundamental. We hear the Prime Minister almost daily using the word `mainstream'. The implication is that everybody who is not in the mainstream has a problem of their own making, whether they be indigenous people, migrants, the unemployed or bureaucrats. There is a whole range of people who are singled out. The idea is that the mythical mainstream is separate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that the mainstream of Australia is made up of literally dozens and dozens of minority groups. There is no such thing as a mainstream. We all are a minority of some kind or another. One day the Prime Minister might wake up and start to realise that the community understands that. Noel Pearson picked the slogan correctly: for all of us but not for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also seen the encouragement and institutionalisation of prejudice and bigotry. That has been going on now for all of their six months. It could be seen in the treatment of the Aboriginal budget. It has been evident in the body language. The level of attention this issue received meant that there must have been a major problem. It was not dealt with in open public discussion; it was done by subtle and quite divisive measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The process of picking out areas for cuts is fascinating. I am looking at where they have mainly targeted. I mentioned the $400 million cut from the ATSIC budget. These people are really well off! In every statistic these people <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are clearly amongst the most disadvantaged people in the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Migrants came in for a fair wallop in the budget. Statistics show that a lot of people on unemployment benefits are from non-English speaking backgrounds. Therefore, there is somehow a problem with migration. That is obviously well known and well established. Those figures have been around for quite some time. If one looks beyond those figures to see what the major cause is, one would find coming through from every bit of research their lack of the English language. The fact that it is so hard to learn English has been the major impediment to getting work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what does the government do? It cuts the funding for the English programs and makes it a user pays system. People who are on the dole who cannot speak English are now required to pay $5,000 to learn English. This is a clever way to help people feel included and feel part of our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard so much about protecting the old. The aged get special favours from the budget&mdash;the government is saving $550 million on aged care over four years. It is an absolute travesty&mdash;not only in principle and focus; it is deceitful. Every day we hear about how the aged have been protected, their pensions are being looked after. Looked after! If cutting half a billion dollars out of their budget is looking after them, I would hate to see how they are looked after when they are hurt. That whole up&hyphen;front nursing home fee is simply a guise for cutting out government contributions towards the cost of building nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another area is higher education. I will point out the figures. The increase in the education work force since 1983 has been 30 per cent&mdash;138,000 extra people work in that area. One and a half times that work in mining altogether. So let us cut them down. Let us squeeze them. This is the area where jobs are coming from, so let us cut them down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One might look through and ask, `What does it all mean?' The areas where the jobs are growing&mdash;where a wise government would invest its resources in activity and energy to keep the growth going&mdash;are the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4382"> areas in which there have been cuts. Education and health care have had cuts. Of course, the health budget will be cut by $300 million over the next four years, on top of state cuts of $1&half; million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Health and aged care suffer, with the user charge of 25 per cent for HACC. All the areas where there is jobs growth are being cut down. Mining, where the number of jobs has gone down, is going to be given the big go. Let us have three more uranium mines. Terrific stuff. Let us export lots more uranium and employ even fewer people. That is what is going on in this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tragedy is that these things take years to work their way through the system. If you pull the levers now, three, four or five years downstream you find the results. The fact is that all those figures were available. The government knows them all. The government's choosing to ignore the most obvious fundamental information in this year's budget really proves a point: this budget is not about economics; it is about ideology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that we are talking about a generation debt. This government is passing on a debt to the next generation of at least 200,000 people who will never work again, a lot fewer people being educated, a lot more older people not finding a place to spend their last years and a health system being cut back when it is already overstretched. This is a legacy. So the debt has been passed on by this government to the next generation. It may not be in money terms. Mind you, money can always be paid back. People cannot be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The social debt contained in this budget will have enormous consequences in the years ahead. It will come back to haunt those opposite, who are so smug and are smirking about this constantly, because they think it is all some kind of a joke. The reality is that all these figures show the fact of the budget.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to address tonight an issue that is very dear to my heart and also to most people from Melbourne&mdash;that is, the future of Australian Rules football. I have refrained from intervening in the debate about the Hawthorn&hyphen;Melbourne merger until this point because I do not think it is appropriate that an Essendon member should tell Hawthorn or Melbourne members what is best for the future of their clubs, but now that the vote is closed and the result is probably not going to be known for a couple of days I think it is appropriate to make some comments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The AFL strategy for the future of the game is driven by broader economic forces which are gradually turning sports like football into industries. The AFL view&mdash;if Australian football does not fully professionalise and nationalise, it will probably disappear&mdash;is on balance probably correct. Unfortunately, the relentless and unbalanced way in which it is pursuing these objectives is threatening the future of the game almost as much.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The AFL has lost touch with the heart and soul of the game. It has lost touch with the passion and the commitment which drives the intense obsession with football in Melbourne. It has lost touch with the ordinary football supporter. Long&hyphen;established clubs&mdash;even the original club, Melbourne&mdash;are being effectively railroaded into mergers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The AFL is exerting heavy and very unsubtle pressure on clubs, including unjustified personal attacks on anti&hyphen;merger figures, using a PR firm to campaign in a quite one&hyphen;sided fashion and fostering a situation in which large numbers of employees of corporate sponsors have joined clubs in order to vote for mergers. We in the ALP know a bit about such stacking techniques, but we usually at least stick to signing up Labor supporters. I would like to know how many members who have recently joined Melbourne and Hawthorn actually barrack for the two clubs concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The AFL has given extraordinary assistance in the form of draft concessions of money to interstate clubs and actively sought to effectively force Fitzroy out of the competition, to destroy Fitzroy and to force other clubs to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4383"> merge. It has promoted changes to suit the fair&hyphen;weather supporter, like night finals, and threatens to introduce a night grand final to maximise TV ratings, even though the vast majority of players and supporters oppose it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The AFL has interfered in the game's judicial process, as illustrated by the recent resignation of Martin Amad for reasons which can only be speculated upon. The AFL is right in one respect: if football had been left alone in the early to mid&hyphen;1980s, it would now be in big trouble. That does not mean, however, that everything the AFL is now doing is correct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The AFL seems not to understand that the real strength of the game is its loyal supporters&mdash;the fanatics, the ones who go every week, who buy the merchandise, who join as members and who pass on their loyalty to their kids. Without them, the heart falls out of your TV ratings, merchandising and corporate sponsorship. The fair&hyphen;weather supporters and bandwagon jumpers that seem to be favoured by the AFL strategies are no long-term substitute for the loyalty, commitment and dedication of the hard&hyphen;core supporters. If the current strategy is allowed to reach completion, I fear that the Australian football of the future will resemble a State of Origin competition&mdash;a lot of hype, artificial teams like the Allies, minimal passion and commitment and not many people actually turning up to watch games.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is something very special about Melbourne's obsession&mdash;the unifying, relatively classless nature of football and the passion of players and supporters. Even though my team, Essendon, is unlikely to merge, at least for the foreseeable future, a little bit of it will die if Hawthorn and Melbourne do merge. The pain of 1983, the triumph of 1984 and 1985, the extraordinary rivalry between those two great teams, Essendon and Hawthorn, in the mid&hyphen;1980s, will be devalued if Hawthorn merges. I do not want to see that go, and I am sure most Hawthorn supporters do not either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe there should be a moratorium on mergers for a couple of years and that the AFL should establish a proper framework of targets for club membership and finances so <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that clubs can avoid being faced with a fait accompli, as it appears that Hawthorn and Melbourne are now faced with. I believe that the federal government should give more assistance to the game. Both the existing government and previous governments have given very little. It is the only unique Australian game and it should be given much more assistance, particularly at the junior level.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last weekend an event was followed with great interest by Australia's Italian community. In the city of Venice, a group of 15,000 supporters of the separatist Northern League party ended their three&hyphen;day march along the banks of the Po River and assembled to proclaim the secession of Italy's northern regions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Behind the Northern League movement lies a suspicion of fiscal inequality in the Italian state. The league's charismatic leader, Umberto Bossi, claims that taxes paid by northern Italian industry is likely to never return to the north where infrastructures are noticeable by their absence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The belief that wealthier areas are supporting poorer ones is nothing new to observers of domestic and international politics. For example, in Australia the largest states have always demanded a share proportional to their economic contributions. Overseas, the unhappiness of Canada's Pacific province of British Columbia is certainly no secret&mdash;many in Vancouver claim that their hard work finances provinces that are less successful but more politically influential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Italy, at present, people of all political persuasions are debating the merits of a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4384"> federal form of government. Many hold the belief that only a level of fiscal autonomy held by states in a federal system will solve the problems highlighted by the Northern League. It is a debate to be followed with interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The debate is relevant to Australia also because we have not been immune to the phenomenon of separatist movements. Western Australia and the New England region are some of the areas where secessionist movements have at times been contemplated. However, Australia's Italian community finds the League's early proclamations particularly disturbing because much of Mr Bossi's rhetoric smacks of racism. He does not merely advocate a degree of economic sovereignty for the north; he advocates the creation of a nation&hyphen;state based on notions of an elite northern race.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Northerner is presented as industrious and honest by nature, the Southerner portrayed as lazy and dependent on government handouts. This is the run-of-the-mill approach of most separatist and, in fact, nationalist movements. Leaders attempt to create differences between `us' and `them' by demonising those who happen to find themselves on the wrong side of their arbitrarily drawn geographic and racial borders. But in Italy as elsewhere such claims, no matter how absurd, are considered by many to be very dangerous. While not claiming to speak for Australia's Italian community, I think I can safely say that most Italian-Australians would find Sunday's march abhorrent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The analogy with what has at times surfaced in Australia has not been lost on me. The problem with those who offer simplistic solutions to complex economic and social problems is that they will always have an advantage over those who offer a more reasonable stance. Intolerance is catchy because it does not require much analysis&mdash;it does not withstand analysis either. In times of great social and economic uncertainty, it is not easy to tell the enraged mob that there is more to everything than meets the eye, when the passionate demagogue needs nothing more than a five&hyphen;second sound byte to explain intolerance.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like all proponents of racial exclusivity, Mr Bossi makes no mention of how best to approach the problem of unscrambling the scrambled eggs. If Italy's northern race is responsible for its own economic success, what are we to make of the work of hundreds of thousands of southern Italians who moved to northern Italy and were an integral part of the country's postwar economic boom?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, in Australia, those who oppose multiculturalism&mdash;or should I say the `anti-multiculturalism industry'&mdash;claim to have an inherent right to impose their vision of Australia on the rest of us. But what about those people like my parents who do not share those values but who have worked all their lives and contributed to making Australia what it is today? Will the New Right decide that they are not worthy of being considered `Australians'? How should we all react to the zeal of those who threaten our dignity by offering intolerance as the solution?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My answer is: with style and restraint. Let us offer moderation when we are expected to brawl; let us count on the voice of reason to stop the populist overtones over our airwaves; let us not dignify, by losing our temper, those people who attack the most vulnerable in the name of their distorted notion of justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Australia education will always be an important part of the fight against these movements. It is important that we remove all emotion and xenophobia from the debate. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Swan (Mr Randall) and I have engaged in conversation in this place and outside on his craven apology of `one rule for Sydney and one rule for Perth' as far as airport noise compensation is concerned. The facts of the matter are these.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In September 1995 the former minister for transport, Laurie Brereton, announced the extension of the noise compensation regime from Sydney airport to Perth and Brisbane. The first stage, so far as Perth was concerned, was a scoping study or a noise audit. A contract for that study was not signed before the election&mdash;and, subsequent to the election, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4385"> in July of this year, the office of the now transport minister, Minister Sharp, advised me that the federal government would not be proceeding either with the scoping study for Perth or the extension of the noise compensation regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effect of that is: one rule for Sydney, a different rule for Perth; one rule for Sydney, a different rule for the bush. It is okay if you live near the electorate of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) so far as airport noise is concerned, but not if you live near Perth airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Swan, in public comments reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> of 30 July 1996, had several things to say about the cancellation of that noise compensation extension. Firstly, he said that it was not `significant'&mdash;unless, of course, you happen to live in Perth near the airport. Secondly, he said it was `pork barrelling'. I fail to understand how a compensation regime that applies generally and legislatively across the Commonwealth can be regarded as pork barrelling. Thirdly, he said that only South Guildford residents would have genuine cause. That is certainly the case so far as South Guildford is concerned, but how do you know anything else unless you do the scoping study?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fourthly, he said that the cancellation had occurred because no money had been set aside in the forward estimates. The budget in 1995 was in May; the announcement of this policy decision was in September. Of course it was not in the 1995 budget's forward estimates. Where you would find the forward estimates or the funds would be in this year's 1996 budget. What happened? The minister for transport scuttled the scoping study, scuttled the extension of the scheme&mdash;therefore, no funds. Finally, on 30 July the member for Swan said that there was no need for a scoping study because ongoing study of Perth airport operations by Airservices Australia was continuous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 31 July in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> he is reported as saying that he would suggest to transport minister John Sharp that the Commonwealth should buy all the houses in Queens Road, South Guildford, and rezone the land for recreational use. If that is not <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> pork barrelling, I do not know what is. There is no legislative regime there&mdash;just a decision by a member of parliament to urge a minister of the Commonwealth to buy all the houses in Queens Road, and then for the Commonwealth, in excess of its authority constitutionally, to rezone the land for recreational use. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Midland Reporter</EMPHASIS> on 10 September 1996 states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Randall said he would be the first to help local people get compensation if they had been eligible for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"> He said the Liberal government did not make the rules regarding compensation package, these were made by airport authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"This (the package) is the one we've been handed and it's the one we have to interpret," . . . </PARA>
<PARA>What a craven apology for scuttling a scheme. What a craven apology for allowing bureaucrats to run legislative programs. And what a change we have seen from 30 July, where he said that people in South Guildford had genuine cause; 31 July, they are going to buy the houses; and, by 10 September, that they did not make the rules and that Mr Randall would be the first to help local people get compensation if only they had been eligible for it. So much for the people of South Guildford&mdash;and so much for the comment by the member for Swan to the House the other night:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am not going to irresponsibly promise things and build up their hopes only to have them dashed.</PARA>
<PARA>Well, he has dashed the hopes of the people of South Guildford&mdash;firstly, by supporting the federal government in a craven apologia: one rule for Sydney, a different rule for Perth; and then by building up hopes of compulsory acquisition and later scuttling them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I noticed that the other night in the House the member for Swan said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By the way, unlike the member for Perth, I notified him that I would be speaking on this matter this evening.</PARA>
<PARA>When I made my comments, the member for Swan was actually in the House. You cannot get better notice than that. When I tried to contact the office of the member for Swan tonight to give him the same courtesy, or lack thereof, that his office gave mine on Thursday night, there was no answer on the telephone. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4386"> I then alerted the Government Whip to try to track him down. The member for Swan should be absolutely assured that, if I were to speak in the House in respect of things like the City of Belmont and industrial relations commissioners or the contents of his nomination for preselection, I would make absolutely sure that he was notified and present in this chamber.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 2 March 1996, the people of Australia voted resoundingly against Paul Keating and the Australian Labor Party. They voted against a party that had lost the plot. The true believers of old had lost faith with the party that no longer listened to the people who had elected it into government. The true believers lost faith with the party that was dominated by a leader who ruled with an arrogance and total disregard for the real people of the Australian community&mdash;the battlers and the families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The true believers lost faith with the party which failed to acknowledge the real workers of this country&mdash;the men and women of the small business sector who put in 60 to 80 hours per week, despite carrying the unfair dismissal legislation like an extra unfair burden upon their working backs, and many of these small businesses are family businesses where there are no perks, no holidays and no time off for good behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The true believers lost faith with the party which had run this wonderful country&mdash;with its enormous wealth of resources in people, agriculture, minerals and opportunity&mdash;into debt to the tune of over $10 billion. The Australian people are well aware that they are the custodians of the future and, as the now generation, they had had enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They voted Mr Keating and his government out of office with a swing that shook the very foundations of the Australian Labor Party. The shock resounded on a political Richter scale in the traditional Labor areas, where the hurt and sense of betrayal created by an aloof and out of touch government saw former Labor strongholds fall to the coalition. One of these Labor strongholds was the seat of Lindsay in western Sydney, where the pointer <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> fairly flew off that Richter scale with a reading of a massive 11.5 per cent swing against the sitting Labor minister, Mr Ross Free.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was no accident or quirk of fate or circumstance. It was due entirely to the quality of the Liberal candidate for the seat of Lindsay, Jackie Kelly&mdash;a shining, vibrant young Australian who personified energy and determination and who offered the promise of the future. Jackie Kelly, the Liberal candidate&mdash;a team member of the John Howard Liberal coalition&mdash;stood up for families and for the real workers of this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instinctively, the people of Lindsay knew that this country needed to return to the family, to assist small business and to create employment opportunities for our young people. They knew that they needed a strong hand to control our national deficit if the traditional Australian inheritance of our forefathers was to be left to the next generation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instinctively, the people of Lindsay knew Jackie Kelly&mdash;she was the perfect candidate; she was one of them. Not only is she intelligent and articulate but also her friendly, outgoing personality endeared her to all who met her and made it very easy for the people of her electorate to identify with her as their chosen representative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But Jackie Kelly is even more. With her fine record of service to Australia as a squadron leader in the RAAF, her time spent as a conference representative to the United Nations and her international rowing achievements, Jackie Kelly is a shining role model for all the daughters of Lindsay. What a change from the previous incumbent&mdash;a minister of the Keating government and very much one of Keating's tired old men.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week the Chief Justice of the High Court ordered that a by-election be held for the seat of Lindsay on the basis of an obscure constitutional technicality&mdash;a technicality which the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) is reported to have agreed should be put to a referendum. Yet it remains that an insult has been delivered to the people of Lindsay and it is an insult to send them the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4387"> message that their first choice is not good enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people of Lindsay will now return to the polls on 19 October to do it all over again, but this time it will not be Free of feeling. There is the sobering sense of deja vu&mdash;the prospect of Keating revisited&mdash;because history shows that swings in by-elections usually average 4.3 per cent against the government of the day. Sadly, with a margin of only 1.5 per cent, there is little hope that Jackie Kelly&mdash;the real Wonder Woman of the West&mdash;will be able to regain her rightful place as the member for Lindsay.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to take this opportunity to speak on two important issues that I have been looking for an opportunity to make some comments on in this place. Both of them are sad in very different ways. One relates to the recent death of the very outstanding arts administrator George Fairfax. He died recently after a 20-year career as the Director of the Victorian Arts Centre. He was a very distinguished supporter of and advocate for the performing arts in particular but for the whole of the arts community in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I met him on several occasions, but particularly during my period as the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services. I found him to be a very thoughtful contributor to the public debate about the nature of Australian culture and the nature of Australian arts. I benefited greatly from his knowledge and his advice. I think there are thousands of Australians who would say the same.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But in recognising that, many other people have spoken more eloquently than I could about that. I wanted to pursue in his memory a particular idea which he raised with me, which I was researching as the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services and which I hope that this new government will pursue in memory of Mr Fairfax. It relates to the extension of the issue of traineeships into the arts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> There are significant problems confronting the young graduates from various arts institu tions, in particular in the visual arts&mdash;the issue he and I were discussing&mdash;because, when you graduate from a visual arts academy, almost by definition you do not have a portfolio that enables you to become a successful visual artist, that enables you to win support from a commercial gallery and that enables you to conduct the sorts of exhibitions that are the basis of commercial sales. Therefore, a very high proportion of young people graduating from these colleges go either into unemployment or into alternative employment, hopefully, in the transition to successful careers as visual artists. But a very high proportion of them are unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we were hoping to do, what we discussed and what I hope the new government might take up is the idea that graduates of arts schools in the visual arts and other young talented visual artists who might not have that opportunity but who are accredited by some established arts training authority might be able to have for 12 months or so their work in the development of such a portfolio qualify for the activity test for unemployment benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This should not increase public sector outlays at all. Almost without exception, they would be young people already receiving unemployment benefit. But it would mean that in that transition period they would be able to develop the necessary prerequisites for a successful career in the arts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I raise that idea. I think it was an idea of great merit. It was an idea to which I was attracted, and I hope others will be attracted to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other issue is entirely different. It relates to a very important small company in my electorate, the electorate of Canberra. It is a research and development company called Learning Curve, which recently drew to my attention that it had to lay off several, almost half, of its staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a company in the high information technology industry. It is threatened by the research and development cuts&mdash;from 150 per cent down to 125 per cent&mdash;but that was not the immediate cause of its problem. It is threatened by the end of syndication, but that was not the end of its problem. It was struck <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4388"> by a third hidden element of the government's cuts to research and development in high technology funding: the change of definition that means that the development of multimedia information technology no longer qualifies for the R&amp;D tax concession. This growing, successful exporting company has lost some of its potential to export for Australia and much of its potential to create jobs for highly qualified young Australians.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I rise to speak about Hunter Regional Tourism Organisation's release today in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hunter Beyond 2000</EMPHASIS> . It is a pretty impressive set of documentation including magazines such as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hunter Discovery</EMPHASIS>  magazine and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Great Days Out of Sydney</EMPHASIS>  magazine. I must give credit to the new Executive Director of Hunter Tourism, Mr David Simmons, a former minister of the previous government in this House. He is doing a tremendous job in organising not only tourism organisers but also local governments, state governments and the federal government and departments to push forward together the word `Hunter' in an overseas operation to bring money and tourists into Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do know it is a fact that 180 domestic tourists coming into the Hunter create one job, yet 18 overseas tourists coming into Australia will create one job also. Therefore, we are seeking support, by initiating this project overseas, to create wealth into Australia. The tourism pie within Australia is basically a set size, and all that we do by working for the Australian market is shift that pie from one end of town to the other. By going forward united and by going forward with a clear definition, a clear direction, some hope and expectation&mdash;and, in particular, using the export market development grants scheme as part funding for the exploitation of the overseas market&mdash;we will make Hunter a household name when people think about New South Wales and Sydney and in particular with the lead&hyphen;up to the Sydney 2000 Olympic <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Games, not only in the coming four years but also in the years after.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has continued on with the commitment of $9&half; million for over 700 jobs for the new work opportunities for Hunter tourism. That was a project started by the previous government, but it is a project that this government is committed to and has continued with. What this will lead to is the guaranteed 70 per cent job retention by the people taking up this program, continued on with schemes such as the MAATS scheme. This will put people into traineeships and apprenticeships, which will mean long-term jobs and not short visits of some six months. It is an initiative which is being well received out in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it does not stop there. This last couple of weeks we have had over 70 familiarity tours from New Zealand through the Hunter. These tours have shown the various tourist products, what is available, the costs and the rare gems of opportunity that exist in the Hunter. Further to that, and again working as a team, in the United States of America HRTO have taken the initiative of doing a direct mail campaign to some one million households, people who shop and subscribe at a store in New York called Bloomingdales. There are one million packages describing the Hunter going out into the community&mdash;one million people, who have already been subscribing to the better class of shopping that is available in America, with a higher level of disposable income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was not as though this project was done just by Hunter Tourism; it has also been supported by Qantas, Air New Zealand, the Australian Tourism Commission and Tourism New South Wales. What we want to do is point out to potential visitors&mdash;those who want a heritage experience, a unique environmental experience, different waterways to explore, beaches, yachting, farm stay holidays or to just relax and get away&mdash;that the brand name Hunter does mean something when people choose a holiday.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

This attack was strongly put to me by the people of Eltham and Heidelberg on Friday. They are particularly appalled at the decision of this government to abolish the Commonwealth dental scheme, because they know what it has meant for them to be able to go to their local community health centre, to go to their local dentist, to get their teeth fixed. They know&mdash;unlike the government&mdash;that you cannot just get your teeth fixed once. They know that no matter what your age, but particularly when you are old, you do need to continue to go to the dentist, and it is a very expensive thing to do.</PARA></TALK.START>

They are certainly letting the local members, both state and federal, know what they think about the massive cuts to nursing home care, to public hospital care and to dental care and what they think about the increased cost of prescriptions. These are all the increases in charges that have been placed on the elderly as a result of this budget. None of these charges have been compensated for by changes to pension arrangements.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The Department is undertaking a survey of all systems that may be affected to establish Year 2000 compliance. Individual Defence Programs have established, or are in the process of establishing, task forces to deal with the problem within their Program. Portfolio coordination is being managed by the Defence Information Management Board which has the issue as a standing item on its agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Defence is represented on the Office of Government Information Technology Year 2000 sub-committee and is contributing to, and complying with, the policy recommendations of that Office on the issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) No accurate estimate is yet available but the cost is expected to be very low in comparisons with estimates for similarly sized organisations which have been reported in the media. Defence has undertaken an extensive modernisation of its information technology and systems, with emphasis on the use of commercial off-the-shelf hardware and software and many of its major systems are known to be Year 2000 compliant already or are scheduled to be upgraded by the supplier as part of regular maintenance. Planned upgrades to Defence financial management systems and planned upgrading, or replacement, of personnel systems will ensure that these systems are compliant.</PARA>
