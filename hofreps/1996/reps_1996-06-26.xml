<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 confirms a trend evident elsewhere in the world of yet another government unable to come to grips with the fundamental questions facing industrialised and developed countries. The two fundamental questions facing all economies in the developed world are, firstly, a fair distribution of income, and, secondly, full employment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Europe there are 34 million people, four million in Germany, unemployed. By contrast, in the United States the casualisation of labour has created millions of working poor. This workplace relations bill is so inept that if successfully passed without the opposition's amendments it will probably create a double whammy: higher unemployment or casualisation of employment and therefore more working poor, or both&mdash;higher unemployment and greater casualisation of labour. The notes provided by the shadow minister for industrial relations, who is in the House, are very instructive for all workers in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australian living standards have long been supported by three key planks: the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, the award system, and the right of workers to organise and bargain on a collective basis. These planks have protected and advanced the wages and conditions of all workers throughout this century in Australia. The bill attacks all three of those planks. It will drastically limit the power of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to settle disputes, it will reduce the central role of the award system, and it will limit the capacity of workers to organise in support of collective bargaining.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The workplace relations bill is all about flexibility, but it is not about fairness. By contrast, Labor recognises the need for flexibility in the workplace but flexibility without abandonment of fairness. Industrial relations is about fairness. It is about people, about the pay they receive and about the standard of living, and it has social consequences. The <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> effect of the bill will be to reduce the living standards of all workers, contrary to John Howard's rock solid guarantee that no worker will be worse off under the coalition's industrial relations policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill represents a more subtle and insidious attack on wages and conditions than that perpetrated by Premiers Kennett and Court. Whereas they sought to directly and immediately reduce wages and conditions, this bill attacks the institutions which underpin workers' wages and conditions, which will inevitably lead to a decline in living standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill is based on a fundamentally flawed assumption that the labour contract is like any other contract and that the parties to it have equal bargaining power. This is clearly not true, as anyone who has lined up for a job with another 100 or 200 competing applicants can testify. The bill will turn the Australian Industrial Relations Commission from an agency which ensured bone fide bargaining and fairness into one which is little more than a minimum wage tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The AIRC, which currently has jurisdiction to conciliate and arbitrate all industrial relations disputes, will be prohibited from arbitrating on claims outside of the 19 prescribed matters or on wage claims above the minimum safety net. It will be able to conciliate. The AIRC will have no role at all in reviewing the new Australian workplace agreements before they come into effect. This restriction on the role of the AIRC will mean that the wages and conditions of employees who do not have industrial muscle will be determined unilaterally by their employer, and weak employees will go cap in hand to their boss about any non-prescribed employment matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will compel employees into direct negotiations with employers and this will have the greater adverse effect on women. When covered by awards, women receive 93.8 per cent of men's wages, but they receive just 54.7 per cent of men's overaward wages. So where wages are set by direct negotiation rather than by the AIRC, women have been severely disadvantaged relative to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2734"> men. This situation will become the norm under the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill prohibits the AIRC setting maximum and minimum hours of work for part&hyphen;time employees and prescribing a proportion of casual and part&hyphen;time workers to full&hyphen;timers. The hours a part&hyphen;time employee works each week will be solely at the discretion of an employer. For example, on a Monday morning an employer can tell a part&hyphen;time employee who normally works 20 hours a week that they are needed for only six and will be due for only six hours pay. The employer may also deny employees certainty about their hours of work and about their income by nominating widely varying hours of work or split shifts. Again, women will be the most adversely affected as most part&hyphen;time positions are held by women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The provisions in this bill enable employers to casualise their work force and continue a trend that has occurred in the United States to workers' great disadvantage and the creation of millions of working poor. With a virtual freedom for employers to get workers into work whenever they are needed and then send them home when they are not required, some employers may never employ full&hyphen;time workers again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill drastically limits the role of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission in acting as an independent umpire of industrial relations. It can set only a limited number of minimum standards. It is the minimalist point of view. Awards will be stripped back to a bare set of minimums and anything over the minimum is up for grabs. Employees will have to bargain for what they already have. The AIRC's capacity to make awards which protect the more vulnerable in the community will be eroded. It will no longer be precluded from varying an award if the variation would disadvantage the employee. This will clearly permit employees to be made worse off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many matters of real importance to employees, such as superannuation, safety, training, study leave and hours of part-time and casual work will not be subject to award protection, but will have to be negotiated between the employer and the employee. The bill allows for a total of just 12 days per annum for sick <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> leave, family leave and compassionate and bereavement leave. Sick leave can be cashed out. It also limits coverage of Australian workplace agreements. They can only be made with corporations, not with sole traders or partnerships. This means that approximately 1.3 million employees will have to have recourse to state enterprise agreements with their substantially reduced minimum standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will mean that the award system will become a bare set of minimum standards, with terms and conditions of employment being set at the workplace level. While Labor accepts that enterprise agreements should be encouraged, this process should not disadvantage employees compared to the relevant award standard, and there should be an independent pre-agreement review by the AIRC to ensure there is no disadvantage. However, neither of these protections will apply, which is a clear indication that the workplace bargaining that will happen under the bill is simply a mechanism to reduce workers' wages and conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will also simplify the award system so that new awards containing matters other than the 19 prescribed matters will be prohibited and existing awards will be reduced to the prescribed matters; all other matters will have to be determined by bargaining. This is simply a measure to remove from awards a large number of conditions of employment, including meal breaks, rest breaks, span of hours, breaks between shifts, manning hours, rostered days off, termination, change and redundancy, promotion, rationalisation of classifications, protective clothing, study leave, training, occupational health and safety, equal opportunity provisions, workplace harassment, paid maternity leave, superannuation and full time, part time and casual classifications. It has huge impact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will prevent the AIRC from making any new paid rate awards and facilitate the conversion of all existing paid rate awards to the minimum rate awards. This will almost certainly lead to lower take home pay for those on paid rates. Who are those people?&mdash;teachers, nurses and emergency workers. Without the paid rates awards, these workers <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2735"> will have to bargain at the workplace for real wage increases, which will entail more industrial strife in areas such as hospitals and schools where it is especially not desirable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will create a system of individual contracts&mdash;Australian workplace agreements, or AWAs. The AWAs will have the status to displace any award&mdash;state or federal&mdash;applying to an employee and will be secret documents. Only the employer and the employee involved will know the terms. Individual contracts in Victoria commonly have a confidentiality clause. If fact, the pro&hyphen;forma contracts prepared by employer groups contain such a clause. There will be no independent scrutiny to guard against a contract that reduces pay and conditions or even a contract that does not comply with the government's own minimum standards. There will be no way of enforcing these minimum standards until after the employee has commenced work under the agreement. Even the means of enforcement will be slow, expensive and legalistic and, no doubt, will also put the employee's job at risk. So the minimum conditions offer only theoretical protection for employees since, in order to do anything about a substandard contract, the employee would have to sue the employer. That is hardly an attractive remedy for the vast bulk of workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill's so-called minimum standards for Australian workplace agreements represent a broken election promise, as these standards replace the promised no-disadvantage test. It is an inadequate replacement because the limited number of minimum standards can in no way ensure that workers will not be worse off, as Howard has guaranteed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill allows for the AWA to be signed before employment. This gives employers the capacity to offer employment on the condition that the potential employee signs the AWA, something that is particularly disadvantageous for employees who have no real bargaining power, as when they are just one of 100 applicants for a job. The bill allows the AWA to specify the period to be used for measuring compliance with the minimum conditions, which means that employees may be required to wait a year before enforcing their minimum wage conditions.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In order to obtain the agreement of individual employees to whatever an employer wants, employers are to be given unparalleled rights to lock individual workers out without pay. Workers will get no effective assistance from the proposed Employment Advocate, an ironic admission of the need for effective trade unions. This advocate will have to act on behalf of employers and employees, making it an inconceivably difficult job to handle the conflict of interest that will arise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill attacks the capacity of workers to organise and bargain collectively in support of improved wages and conditions. Legitimate actions by employees in advancing their conditions will be subject to draconian penalties which seek to penalise, rather than resolve, industrial disputes. So-called illegal industrial action can bring a penalty of $10,000 compensation and injunctions. The bill will give employers the ability to severely restrict, or even totally block, the union's right to represent a group of workers. A union visit will require a written invitation by employees. The long established right of unions to enter work premises to check award adherence, work procedures, machinery, appropriate documents and records will be lost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will also restrict any dealings a union official has to only the worker or workers willing to put their names on the required invitation&mdash;something many workers, for obvious reasons, will be reluctant to do. The shadow minister for industrial relations, who is at the table, gave the example of an employer at Tweed Valley who recently advised employees that approaches to the union would be regarded as serious and wilful misconduct justifying the sack. The workers who will be most disadvantaged by these provisions will be those already most vulnerable due to their lack of market power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2736"> The bill is confrontationist and divisive and will have the effect of increasing industrial unrest. Under Labor governments since 1983, Australia has enjoyed an historically low level of industrial disputation. The highest number of strikes in any full year under a Labor government was fewer than the lowest num ber of strikes in any full year under the Fraser government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill contains a substantial increase in anti-strike measures, indicating an intention to punish industrial disputes rather than resolve them. Why is this necessary at a time when industrial disputes are at an all-time low? The only explanation is that the government is aware that the bill will create industrial disputation and is arming itself against that. However, neither employers nor unions want a return to confrontation. Employers have expressed concern about the proposal to scrap the power of the AIRC to settle disputes. The Metal Trades Industry Association has also expressed concern about the likely proliferation of unions at the workplace which would result from the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will herald the return to the $3 youth wage proposed under Fightback. Minister Kemp has flagged that young people could be required to work for a weekly take-home wage equivalent to the dole. This is despite the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), prior to the election, promising that youth wages will not be anything remotely resembling a $3 youth wage&mdash;full stop, end of story. The bill allows employers to decide how much of the time young people spend at work is productive and how much is training, and the training can take place entirely on the job. This means that a young person may be forced to attend work five days a week but be paid for only one or two days, which would result in an average hourly rate of around $3.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minimum conditions applicable to both certified agreements and Australian workplace agreements do not guarantee trainees and apprentices their existing award rates. At best, they are guaranteed the same amount as the dole&mdash;$3.05 for 16- and 17-year-olds. The bill, in its provision that apprentices should not be paid for time spent at TAFE or other training institutions, means that apprentices can receive less than the award entitlement, thus reversing a battle that was won in the 1950s. The bill also discriminates on the basis of age by providing for junior wage rates. This means that a 20-year-old employee is paid less than an equally competent 22-year-old. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill permits state enterprise agreements to override federal awards. No longer will it be possible to escape the industrial legislation of the Tory states by seeking federal award coverage, by giving precedence to state workplace agreements. The Prime Minister is going back on his rock solid guarantee that no worker will be worse off. Employees in Victoria, Western Australia and Tasmania employed under a federal award may be required to sign a state enterprise agreement, under which their wages and conditions would be considerably reduced. New employees are also more likely to be offered enterprise agreements with lower wages and conditions than available awards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Look what this means for, say, a worker in Western Australia. The Prime Minister promised a no-disadvantage clause, whereby employees cannot be worse off. Take-home pay must be no less than that prescribed under the award. However, a no-disadvantage clause does not apply under Western Australia's Minimum Conditions Act for Workplace Agreements, and that will take precedence. The Prime Minister promised four weeks paid annual leave, cumulative and pro rata&hyphen;ed. In Western Australia, some of this entitlement is subject to forfeiture, and that will take precedence. Howard promised two weeks paid sick leave per annum, cumulative and pro rata&hyphen;ed. The Western Australian minimum is not cumulative, and that will take precedence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Howard promised family leave, compassionate and bereavement leave as specified under the relevant award. In Western Australia, the guaranteed minimum is inferior to most award provisions, and that will take precedence. Thus, by giving precedence to state workplace agreements, the Prime Minister is washing his hands of his pre-election promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2737"> This bill allows Howard's federal minimum standards to be totally circumvented&mdash;a clear breach of the rock solid guarantee the Prime Minister gave during the election campaign that no worker would be worse off. The fact is that workers in Victoria, Western Australia and Tasmania will be worse off. Queensland workers will soon be worse off, given Borbidge's stated intention of enacting How ard&hyphen;style industrial laws, and I suppose South Australia will not be much further behind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ethan Kapstein, Director of Studies at the Council of Foreign Relations in the United States, in a recent article in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Foreign Affairs</EMPHASIS> volume 75 No. 3 gives a wide range of criteria against which this bill can be evaluated. He says these things:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Just when working people most need the nation-state as a buffer from the world economy it is abandoning them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> For generations students were taught that increasing trade and investment, coupled with technological change, would drive national productivity and create wealth.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been waiting a long time to be able to stand up and speak on our government's Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996. I do not refer to the time since the bill was introduced into the House, although that has been a while as so many people have wanted to say something on the matter. I refer to the fact that good industrial relations legislation has been a long <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> time coming&mdash;13 years plus, in fact. What we have seen during that time has been legislation by and for the ACTU&mdash;not for employers or employees but for trade union bosses. There are some interesting connections and relevances there which I will return to later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I speak about some aspects of this legislation I will comment on some of the things that have been said already by some of the other members of the House as part of this debate. The honourable member for Canberra (Mr McMullan), speaking on 30 May in this debate, asserted that workers will be worse off. He asserted that people will be forced off their awards and that the arbitration system will not continue to play a role. Each of those assertions is blatantly wrong. He is being deliberately mischievous&mdash;just as he was when he talked about `the very many other commitments already broken'. What utter rubbish. If he wants to talk about broken commitments, he had best have a look at his own party's performance after the 1993 election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The contribution to the debate by the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) also caught my attention. If ever there was a speech for the union bosses this was it. The chiefs of the South Coast Trades and Labour Council probably had a fair bit to do with it. The good old lines were dragged out&mdash;`the government benches are ideologically driven to say that all unions are dreadful and must be stamped out'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is not anti-union. If anything, it encourages more unions but unions that are relevant to workplaces and to workers&mdash;something that has been disappearing over the past decade. Hasn't that been obvious as literally hundreds of thousands of workers deserted the union movement under the leadership of the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean) and, more particularly, the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), who, I see, has joined the House? This is a record that the Labor Party rewarded them for: the Peter principle is alive and well in the Labor Party. I will return to that cosy relationship between the Labor Party and union bosses.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2738">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said earlier, many members have spoken on this bill and many more will. Therefore, I will limit my comments to just some aspects of it. If there is a single word to describe what this legislation is all about, it is `flexibility'. Even the honourable member for Canberra agrees with that. He said so in his contribution to the debate. What he got wrong was that he said there was no fairness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is it unfair to give employers and employees a more direct relationship? Is it unfair to ensure freedom of association? Is it unfair to allow employees the opportunity to balance their work and family responsibilities? Is it unfair to give employees the opportunity to earn higher wages? Is it unfair to have a fair unfair dismissal system? Those are just a few of the provisions in our bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> This bill is all about fairness, and that is what those on the other side do not like. Their definition of fairness is whatever the union bosses think is fair. We all know what that means: no ticket, no start. That is what that means: none of this competition stuff for the union leaders. We cannot have them having to provide a good service to keep members or get new members. Goodness, no! Big business and big unions are the only solution from the opposition&mdash;a centralist socialist system works better that way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I get very aggravated when I hear people's claims that there is not much difference these days between the Labor Party and the coalition parties, because nothing could be further from the truth. There is a great philosophical difference&mdash;a difference well recognised by the electorate on 2 March, and a difference very well demonstrated by this bill. One of the great differences between our workplace relations bill and the Labor Party's industrial relations record is that our bill recognises all workplace situations&mdash;small business, medium business, big business and all the scenarios that go with those&mdash;whereas our opponents cannot handle anything that is outside big business and big unions. They want everything neat and tidy and simple&mdash;nothing complicated. They do not want small business in there upsetting the apple cart; small businesses working out things in an amicable way <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with their employees. Not on your life! Union bosses might lose control of the situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition are ideologically opposed to a vibrant small business because it takes away their control by union bosses. We recognise that small business will contribute most in solving our unemployment problem; big business has been reducing employment. The government must do all it can to create the right climate for small business to grow, invest and therefore employ.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has commented on numerous occasions that, by far and away, the thing most said by small business was, `Fix unfair dismissals.' Those opposite me always laughed and ridiculed him each time he made that comment. To me, that shows just how out of touch they were&mdash;and still are&mdash;or just how plain uninterested they are in small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say that with some authority on two accounts. Firstly, during the nine months leading up to the federal election, I spent a lot time visiting small businesses throughout my electorate. I did not just visit an isolated business here or there but went door to door, down the main streets in  Braidwood, Bungendore, Batemans Bay, Bodalla, Bega and Bombala. I can assure members opposite that the Prime Minister was spot&hyphen;on with his comments regarding unfair dismissals. Virtually every business raised it with me, and nearly all of those put it as the major issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My second authority is my own experience in business. After 23 years in the private sector&mdash;the last 13 years as an employer&mdash;I can profess to knowing something about employing people and keeping a small business going. I mentioned in my maiden speech that one of the great buzzes in small business is being able to give someone a job. I have employed a lot of people so I have had plenty of buzzes, but I could have had more, particularly in the last few years. But, like so many small business owners, I was very cautious about employing additional staff even when I had the work for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With life being tricky enough in small business, the last thing I needed was to employ someone who did not work out and then to be haunted by unfair dismissal laws. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2739"> It is far easier and safer to work a bit longer yourself each week and to ask existing staff to do a bit more overtime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I could empathise very well with small business owners to whom I spoke during the campaign when they told me how they were working harder and longer, how they would love to employ another person but were too scared to. The previous Labor government continued to ignore this and only in the last dying moment of their term did they finally move to redress the injustice&mdash;but still only in part. The psychological scar left on employers by that dreadful law will take some time to heal, even after our very fair changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I leave unfair dismissals, let us look at some of the other things said by members opposite during this debate. The honourable member for Canberra in his contribution again demonstrated a total lack of feeling towards employers on this subject, plus a very limited knowledge of company structures and their value, when criticising aspects of our legislation. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price), quite remarkably, blamed the problem of Labor's unfair dismissal laws on the lawyers. He went on to describe a situation where a small business person will pay out some compensation rather than paying out more in legal fees, even when the lawyer is confident he will win. This is exactly what has been happening. I have been told of many specific examples&mdash;one recently in Bega&mdash;where an employee has left a position in very amicable circumstances, only to reappear some time later claiming unfair dismissal. You cannot blame the employer for being convinced to pay the person a negotiated amount rather than have the costly hassle of court hearings that will drag them away from their businesses, possibly for days on end. But do not blame the lawyers for this. The problem is the law, and everyone knows it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our system will provide employees with access to a fair and simple process of appeal against dismissal. It will be fair to both employer and employee. It will minimise legal costs and, importantly, it will discourage frivolous and malicious claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn back to the matter of non&hyphen;compulsory unionism. Members opposite would have you <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> believe there is currently no such thing as compulsory unionism. Anyone working in the real world would say otherwise. Compulsory unionism and preference clauses in awards under the current system are alive and well. Discrimination and victimisation are rampant and the Labor Party should be ashamed to have allowed such a situation to go on, as it has under the current legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only recently I was provided with details of a company in my electorate which was having difficulties with a project due to the superannuation company that it wanted to use. This company was subcontracting to the head contractor. The head contractor wrote to the company in question and basically said that if they wanted to avoid any ongoing site problems, they may as well do as the union wanted and pay their workers' superannuation into the fund that was substantially controlled by the union. If that is not discrimination and victimisation, I do not know what is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our legislation is all about choice. If you want to belong to a particular union, that is fine. If you do not, that is also fine. And do not forget that this also applies to  employer organisations. Another aspect of this part of the legislation which should be commended are the provisions that will strengthen the accountability of organisations to their members by improving the financial accounting and reporting provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now want to say something about secondary boycotts. I am particularly pleased that meaningful secondary boycott provisions will be restored to the Trade Practices Act and that the relevant provisions of the Industrial Relations Act 1988 will be repealed&mdash;not before time. Allow me to describe to you a current incident occurring in my electorate which demonstrates how the union chiefs are exerting their power in this regard. In the 1980s, Eurobodalla Shire Council purchased a property in the commercial district of Batemans Bay. They bought it at the time as they saw it was cheaper to buy the property than expose ratepayers to the cost of covering car parking credits attached to the land. They subsequently extinguished the credits and then waited for the market to improve, whereupon they proposed to sell it for redevelopment and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2740"> use the money for the construction of car parking on a more appropriate site.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1994, council decided to place grass and shrubs on the site to lessen the dust nuisance and create a temporary park until the site was sold and a new town square and park were developed across the road. The acquisition of this property cost the council $1.16 million. In recent times the council has moved to make good its commitment; that is, sell the property for development and proceed with much needed car parking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But along comes the South Coast Trades and Labour Council. Some Labor Party people, you see, decided they wanted to keep the temporary park&mdash;hang the expense, hang council's responsibilities to the ratepayers. So, when the council told these people that keeping the temporary park was not on, they said, `We'll fix that,' and promptly got Paul Matters, the Secretary of the South Coast Trades and Labour Council, to put a black ban on the site. He said the union movement will make sure no development occurs on it. So now we have a situation where interested commercial parties are getting nervous about negotiating to purchase this property because the South Coast Trades and Labour Council has black&hyphen;banned the site.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind honourable members just how tough it is out in regional Australia. The Batemans Bay area has, I believe, the highest unemployment levels in the state and youth unemployment is running at about 40 per cent. So every bit of extra development would be rather nice, thanks very much. But not for the union bosses. One additional incredible aspect of this is that the local union, the MEU, does not agree with the South Coast Trades and Labour Council. The salaried staff of the Eurobodalla Shire Council who are members of the MEU unanimously defeated a motion supporting the black ban&mdash;yet another example of the union bosses being out of step with their members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has puzzled me somewhat as to why those opposite have taken the attitude to this bill that they have. Why would they want to deny workers a choice? Why would they prevent workers negotiating higher wages? Why stop employers having the flexibility <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that will give them the opportunity to employ a few more people? I could not quite put my finger on it&mdash;there was a constant theme in the attitude of members opposite&mdash;so I decided to look at the background of members opposite. I know the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) commented yesterday on the previous life of some opposition members. I will be fair and look at them more as a collective&mdash;and `collective' is a good word, actually, when you do the analysis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It really is interesting to read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Parliamentary Handbook</EMPHASIS>, because it explains very well why the opposition has the attitude it does towards our legislation. To some degree I had to make some assumptions, as members opposite have been a little circumspect with their previous occupations. But, based on the assumption&mdash;I believe a reasonable one&mdash;that they would have listed their most important and significant occupations prior to entering federal parliament, I have come up with the following results.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are 49 members opposite&mdash;just in case we have forgotten, just 49. Sixteen of those were union organisers of some sort prior to being given a seat in parliament and another seven have done nothing other than work within Labor politics. So 23 out of 49&mdash;that is, 47 per cent&mdash;come from a totally union or Labor politics background. A further 11 were teachers or academics&mdash;that represents another 22 per cent&mdash;and another 11 were public servants. That leaves four who sort of squeeze into the private sector area. I am not knocking unionists, political workers, teachers, academics or public servants. But the fact is that the backgrounds of those opposite comprise a very narrow part of the community&mdash;not exactly representative of the broader community, one might say.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I guess when one takes this into account, it is no wonder that they have the attitude they do towards industrial relations. It is also no wonder that they introduced the unfair dismissal law, as they did, and could not understand what the fuss was all about. The honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton), who was the architect of it, could not have had a clue as to what he was saddling small business with. He has been a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2741"> politician all his life. He would not have been able to understand the plight of a small business person.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My analysis is also well supported when you read some of the things those opposite have said as part of this debate. A very good example is the honourable member for Cunningham when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Have we seen company profit levels fall in the last several years? Have we seen people in the business community and the business leaders taking cuts of several hundreds of thousands of dollars to their massive salaries? No, we have not. We have seen those profit levels go through the roof.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the same sort of arrogant, out&hyphen;of&hyphen;touch claptrap that the former Prime Minister went on with before the election&mdash;and we know what the people thought of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those opposite have no idea of the real world. The honourable member for Cunningham looks at the profits of BHP and the big banks and thinks that is all there is to the business community. Go and tell those small business owners who were hit with 20 per cent&hyphen;plus interest rates during the `recession we had to have' that they made massive profits and see what their reaction will be. Go and tell the 38,736 businesses that went bankrupt in the years 1983-95&mdash;that is an average of 3,228 per year&mdash;and the 5,387 businesses that went bankrupt in the years 1991-92 about massive profits and big salaries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is vital to my electorate of Eden-Monaro. Eden-Monaro relies heavily on the investment provided by small business, and small business needs the flexibility that this legislation will provide. I know that when I go from business to business down the main streets of Queanbeyan, Moruya, Narooma, Merimbula, Eden or Cooma these changes to industrial relations practices will be uppermost in those owners' minds. They have been hanging out for the changes. They have been waiting a long time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We could not have been more open about our policy on industrial relations in the lead-up to the 2 March poll. Everyone knew what we were about. This industrial relations policy and the one-third sale of Telstra were our two most prominent election platforms. The <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people embraced them on 2 March. Let us make this law so that Eden-Monaro and Australia can become competitive again and forge forward.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the workplace relations bill, which I strongly believe threatens the very fabric of our society. In raising these issues, can I say that the nature of workplace relations between employer and employee is, if anything, a key measure of the type of society we wish to build in this country. Unfortunately, the member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Nairn) has shown by his speech today his ignorance of the real relationship and the need to lock in a change in culture governing that very relationship, how we as a nation work at a workplace level and how we continue to build on the successes of the last 10 to 13 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that we in Australia have been able to build institutions, build a society, which guarantees a sense of fair play if anything&mdash;a sense of decency&mdash;in the workplace. That is what industrial relations is about. That is what the huge achievements of the accord processes of the last 13 years have been about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, can I say that I believe the coalition has shown, by the very type of legislation it is introducing in this House, that its vision for society is one which weakens the rights of employees, especially those with the least power. It is unfortunate that the member for Eden-Monaro did not raise this very issue. The thrust of the government's workplace relations bill is about weakening the power of those who really need assistance at a workplace level. I am talking, for example, about women, migrants, young people, casual and part-time workers and rural workers. They are the types of workers who will lose as a result of the government's workplace relations legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suggest that the workplace relations bill, rather than improving the texture of the relationship in workplaces, will in the long term actually undermine the improvements of the last decade&mdash;actually undermine the growing cooperation which we have seen evolve over the last decade. Anyone with a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2742"> sense of pride in this country should be concerned about the effects on the relationships in the Australian workplace that this legislation has the potential to introduce.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a proud Australian, I am concerned that this legislation is planting&mdash;yes, planting, unfortunately&mdash;an ugly time bomb which has the potential to rip apart the texture of the Australian workplace and, in turn, rip apart the very nature of relationships between all Australians. I raise these issues because one of the achievements of the last 13 years has been to move away from the cyclical approach to industrial relations. That was really the nature of industrial relations prior to 1983. There was a dog&hyphen;eat&hyphen;dog approach to industrial relations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the economy was booming, the reality of industrial life was that the trade union movement had the upper hand. When the economy was down, unfortunately ruthless employers had the upper hand. What the accord achieved over the last 13 years was a dramatic move away from the cyclical approach to industrial relations to a commitment by workers, unions and employers to work together. It was not about sinking the boot when one could. For example, when there was a shortage of labour in the late 1980s, which would have historically resulted in a wages breakout, what did the union movement do? It imposed a ceiling on wage outcomes for the purpose of repositioning Australia economically and building on the competitive changes that had been initially achieved in the post&hyphen;1983 period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to say that a lot of employers also adopted a similar attitude in more recent years in an international recession. We as a nation learnt from the mistakes of the past in the cyclical approach to industrial relations. Australia in 1996 is a better place as a result of this change in attitude. What it was really about was a change in attitude, the development of a new culture. It was not a legalistic approach to industrial relations, which is what the current bill is about, but a willingness by people to sit down and talk about the issues at a workplace level. It is for that very reason that we commenced to attract some major investments to Australia. We clearly proved <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that we had commenced to lock in a change in attitude for the development of a new culture on the industrial relations front that made Australia an attractive place for investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decision of Toyota to invest in Melbourne was a major achievement for the state of Victoria and for the nation at large. There is the German wool combing company that invested in Geelong, in Victoria. It was the first time that they had ever decided to invest outside of Germany. They were convinced that, at long last, Australia had changed its industrial relations culture. It had moved away from one based on legalism to one based on a willingness to cooperate, sit down and talk the issues through. That is why I say that the bill before the House is planting an ugly time bomb. That ugly time bomb has the capacity to undermine the very changes that I have spoken about in passing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have read some of the speeches of those on the government side. It is very obvious that most of them have not had much to do with managing and running a workplace. Most of their speeches show the essentially blinkered attitude of government MPs and the blinkered attitude of those people on the other side who drafted this piece of backward legislation. They are blind to the major changes that Australian society has gone through in the last decade. You are trying to ignore the massive changes to the industrial relations culture in this country that have occurred over the last decade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note that no-one on the government side wants to read the basic statistics, which show that industrial disputation has dropped dramatically. This is the true indicator of the real improvements in Australian workplace culture. It is reflected in government statistics but, more importantly, reflected in a change of attitude at a workplace level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You just do not seem to understand the changes in the relationship between employer and employee that have developed due to the best practice standards which Labor government programs fostered in our workplaces. It is the best practice movement which the new Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2743"> very quickly moved to do away with on the election of the coalition government on 2 March.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If people have any doubts about that, they ought to go through the bill. Where in the bill is there any real support for the consultative process at the workplace level that we have put in place? Where in the legislation is there any real support for works councils and best practice processes? When do you ever hear the government talk about those very objectives? There is no mention about people actually sitting down, consulting and working together. Those concepts are not to be found in the bill or the speeches of the Minister for Industrial Relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the promises of the coalition in the last election, the nightmare that I fear is that we will not be going forward under this workplace relations bill; we will be going backwards&mdash;and at a very fast rate. We will be going backwards to the era when Prime Minister John Howard last sat on the government benches as Treasurer, a very senior member of the Fraser&hyphen;Anthony government. We all remember that unfortunate period. John Howard as Treasurer: what a period of non&hyphen;performance for this nation at large.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is the issue of inflation. The coalition with John Howard as Treasurer had allowed inflation to rip to over 10 per cent when the Labor Party was elected to government in March 1983. On the employment front, John Howard had over 700,000 Australians looking for jobs. That was in the context of a much smaller labour force. There were over 150,000 young Australians looking for jobs. That is John Howard's concern for the issue of jobs in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, it was worse than that. Australia was at war industrially. There were battles in almost every workplace, as people pressured their unions to fight for decent pay, because the coalition government then&mdash;as is the case now&mdash;did not have a wages policy. We had industrial war in the sixties, seventies and early eighties. I am afraid that this legislation will return us to that era.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had an industrial war as union members told their elected leaders that they needed to fight to ensure that their pay packets were not <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> eroded by John Howard's legislation. They needed to fight to ensure that their basic work conditions did not disappear. We are going to return, with the erosion of the award system, to having to go back into the workplace and fight to rebuild those basic conditions of employment and to ensure that workers are again legally protected. This is because of this government's approach to the award system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this legislation gets passed in its entirety, then we will be returning to that era. But why? It is because the word of John Howard, the Prime Minister, cannot be trusted. His so-called rock solid guarantee to workers has been proven to be worthless by the introduction of this bill. It is as worthless as his rock solid guarantee has proven to be on a series of policy decisions since his election on 2 March. His rock solid guarantee has no value. If anything, it is like papier-mache. That is what the Prime Minister's rock solid guarantee is now worth to working Australians. In essence, the rock solid guarantee is like papier-mache.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say that because this legislation will, for example, lead to young people having their wages cut to a measly $3.05 an hour. Mr Howard's rock&hyphen;solid guarantee for young people is, without a doubt, the Fightback policy of 1992. I know the coalition tried to create an impression in the Australian community prior to 2 March that Fightback had been thrown away, but it has not been thrown away. It has not been thrown away in the industrial relations arena and it has not been thrown away with respect to the social security system. We read in today's papers about the real agenda on the social security front: how they are going to attack families and how they are going to attack the disadvantaged and the unemployed. Their real agenda is Fightback of 1992. That is what is going to occur to young people under this bill. The Fightback policy is `Jobsback' of 1992 at $3 an hour and now $3.05 an hour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation also undermines, I think, a very important Australian institution. The government is to be condemned. One independent umpire which can resolve differences in the workplace&mdash;an independent organisation&mdash;is the Australian Industrial Relations <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2744"> Commission, a true&hyphen;blue Australian institution. It is an institution I have always had a great deal of respect for, even when, on occasion, it did not always see eye to eye with a particular case I was pushing at the time. It is an institution which allowed the members of my old union, the Miscos&mdash;whose members are among the most industrially weak, most marginalised and least skilled workers in this country&mdash;an equal chance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an institution which provides a balance between employers and employees. It is an institution which the current government in Washington looks at almost enviously and wants to emulate as an efficient, trustworthy way of resolving disputes between employers and employees. Why is the rock&hyphen;solid guarantee really papier mache? Because this legislation so restricts the operation of the award system that those on minimum rates will have no guarantees about their access to over&hyphen;award agreements previously negotiated. For the industrially strong I know that is not a problem, but it sure is a problem for the least skilled&mdash;women and workers from a non&hyphen;English speaking background. All the efforts of the last decade to narrow the gap between the wages of men and women will disappear overnight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yes, there has been a lot of rhetoric in this chamber about unions, about the amalgamation process and about how unions&mdash;which are most important in the amalgamations&mdash;are somewhat of a bad thing. One coalition member spent most of his time in the House when discussing this legislation rabbiting on about big business, big unions and big government. It might be a populist line, but it is unrealistic. The reality is that, while amalgamations have not been the cure&hyphen;all, they have been very important in decreasing demarcation disputes&mdash;the bane of both industry and unions for many years. Amalgamations of unions have also been very important in breaking down some of the false barriers that existed between unskilled and skilled workers. Union amalgamations, I suggest, have actually encouraged the upskilling of the work force and provided opportunities where there were once barriers <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to significant groups of unskilled workers. These important gains&mdash;and they are important gains for employer and employee&mdash;are now threatened by this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation gives the opportunity for certain elements to actually foul up the progress by tying up unions in costly long litigation about de&hyphen;amalgamation. I suggest to you that this particular provision in the bill is not really done out of some real sense of how we can try to improve the competitive edge for our export industries and the efficient operation of our economy&mdash;it is really about spite. This is the spite provision of the coalition government; they are a very spiteful government. The Prime Minister and the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) know all about spite. Just ask Janet Holmes a Court&mdash;the International Businesswoman of the Year&mdash;about the manner in which she was forced to resign as chair of the Centenary of Federation Council. She was appointed by the previous government&mdash;in consultation, I might add, with the then deputy leader of the coalition, now Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer). That is what spite is about. It is about spite with respect to individuals in the Australian community and it is about this very industrial relations bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can only say that the legislation will not destroy the union movement, nor will the endeavours by this government to use this legislation to make right of union entry to a workplace be a major difficultly to us&mdash;we will survive it as we have in the past. But I am worried about the de&hyphen;amalgamation process, because I suggest that it might return us to the bad old days. It might, in actual fact, encourage the old rogue elements who have no loyalty to the greater union movement or the future of Australia back into the workplace. It will allow the old BLF types to get back into the industrial relations arena. I can just see the ex&hyphen;BLF types rubbing their hands in glee and saying, `Here we go, here we go. We're in for another chance. Let's form, for example, the 2000 Olympics Building Workers Union in Sydney.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> A breakaway union on that site, without any responsibility to the rest of the union movement or the nation at large, would have <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2745"> no responsibility to other construction workers. Alternatively, down in Melbourne&mdash;Mr Kennett's territory&mdash;we could have the City Link Construction Workers Union. I am sure if that union is established and undermines Jeff Kennett's pet program at the moment, Peter Reith will very soon get a phone call attacking this very legislation. It is not a panacea for unemployment or a panacea to improve industrial relations in the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is simplistic, it is out of date, it is legalistic. It would be better if government backbenchers faced up to the fact that more jobs and more job opportunities will be destroyed by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in the August budget than will be created by this ugly piece of community bashing, worker bashing legislation. It would be better if the government backbenchers spent more time lobbying their Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone), lobbying their Treasurer and lobbying their Minister for Science and Technology (Mr McGauran) to ensure that the August budget saves the positive programs of Working Nation. They would be better off ensuring that labour market programs which have actually created real jobs are saved rather than wasted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation is going to waste an opportunity that we have created over the last decade to take Australia forward and to continue to attract investment in Australia. The end result of this legislation will be a return to the bad old days&mdash;the cyclical approach to industrial relations and the `dog eat dog' workplace. That might not worry the coalition, because they have not got a wages policy. Their real solution to having a wages policy in Australia, in their minds, is to increase unemployment so that pressure is placed on the wages system. They believe that, through high unemployment, there is less capacity for workers to negotiate with their employer and less capacity to improve wages and conditions of employees. All I can say is that, in 1983, we learned from the bad experiences of the last coalition government when there was a lack of wages policy in Australia. Australia does not want to return to those bad old days, and the coalition ought to rethink its <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> approach to industrial relations. It is a conflict model which is based on legalism. It is not based on trying to lock in, once and for all, a change in culture and a change in attitude.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, the coalition should take off the blinkers and the blindfolds. There never was any need for this legislation, except for the ideological imperative to bash employees and bash their representative organisations. That is what it is about: bashing workers, bashing their representative organisations and taking Australia back to the bad old industrial relations days, when the coalition was last in government, when this nation did not have a wages policy, when there was an essence of industrial war in every workplace in Australia, when Australia lost as a nation, and when Australia was not an attractive place for investment. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure to speak on the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill in the House today. Listening to the previous speaker&mdash;the honourable member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson)&mdash;was quite interesting. I first came into this parliament in 1993. At the 1993 election, the former Labor government, under the leadership of Paul Keating, proposed that they were going to reform the industrial relations system; they were going to introduce new legislation that was going to create more flexibility and competition. It did not happen because the trade union movement in Australia called in their dues following the 1993 election. The then leader and secretary of the trade union movement were heavily involved in knocking the then minister, the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith (Mr Brereton), on his initial draft of that bill. I dug out my speech on the bill in 1993. I opened my address by saying:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Industrial Relations Reform Bill is arguably the most important bill to come before this House during the current parliament. With this bill the government has had the opportunity to genuinely address one of the major impediments to employment facing Australia today&mdash;that is, the rigid system of centralised wage fixing and industrial relations control in this nation.</PARA>
<PARA>They took their foot off the pedal. They outlined that they were going to implement those reforms and they did not because the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2746"> levers got pulled on them by the people from behind the scenes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will never forget a speech in this place during the last parliament by the former member for Capricornia when she said that she was proud to be a member of the political wing of the ACTU. She was not representing her electorate as a member of the Labor Party; she was representing her electorate as a member of the political wing of the ACTU. That is recorded in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. I think that was fairly indicative of a lot of the members of the Labor Party in the previous government. They went to the 1993 election and said, `We are going to reform industrial relations. We are going to reform the workplace; we are going to make it more flexible and competitive.' But it just did not happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We went through that three&hyphen;year period in Australia's history and now we have moved past the 1996 election. The coalition clearly enunciated to the people of Australia exactly what we proposed to do with industrial relations. That is what this Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill is all about. It is quite clearly what we spelt out to the people of Australia about what we saw should be taking place with regard to industrial relations in Australia and the way we saw that being freed up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I go back to the period from 1993 onwards when the former government told the people of Australia that they were going to take this action. They have been given raps for being fairly innovative in a number of areas, particularly of micro&hyphen;economic reform. I read an article produced by the Business Council of Australia recently that was giving those raps to the previous government. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has undertaken an impressive program of microeconomic reform over the last decade. Indeed by world standards few countries would have dared to follow Australia in its spectacular program of unilateral tariff reduction; financial deregulation and public sector reforms . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Where are the reforms in the workplace? Where is the freeing up of the industrial relations system? Where is the competition in the industrial relations system? Not mentioned. The previous government attacked all those areas of deregulation, trying to produce <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> greater competition in a lot of areas in Australia's economy; not so in the industrial relations arena.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anybody that comprehensively reads the Hilmer report into national competition policy and looks for areas recommended to be opened up will find the following recommendations: that we open up all the statutory bodies, we do away with statutory marketing authorities, and we make sure that there is full and genuine competition in all these areas. One element conspicuous by its absence from the Hilmer report was the labour market. He did not address the labour market. In one chapter, he identified that it was specifically being excluded from the report on national competition policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In any economy, where you are going to move through the dramatic changes that have taken place in world economies, and particularly in Australia in recent years, you cannot address business capital without addressing the labour market. The former government tried to address the labour market but someone else got hold of the levers. I dare say it was Bill Kelty and Martin Ferguson who got hold of the levers and pulled them and steered the former Labor government in a different direction to the direction that it was supposed to go. That was the period between 1993 and 1996. In 1996, the coalition put together a comprehensive package of reforms, took it to the Australian people at the 2 March election and was subsequently elected with a very large mandate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government can claim to have a mandate to introduce these reforms and get them through both houses of this parliament. The people of Australia recognise that this needs to take place. They recognise that this government must introduce these reforms so that there is flexibility and competition not only in all other sectors of the economy but also in the labour market, because they have been left out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2747"> The objects of the new act focus the system on giving primary responsibility for industrial relations and agreement making to employers and employees&mdash;the people who are directly affected by those agreements; the first and second issue parties, as it were. The responsi bility is being given to the employers and employees at the enterprise and workplace levels with the role of the award system confined to providing a safety net of minimum wages and conditions, to ensuring freedom of association, to ensuring the avoidance of discrimination and to assisting employees to balance their work and family responsibilities effectively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is the safety net of minimum wages and conditions but, at the same time, there is freedom of association. My understanding is that freedom of association is one of the essential elements of our constitution. If someone wants to belong to a union, it is their right and they are entitled to do so. If they do not want to belong to a union, that is also their right. We want to remove that obligation from the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The award system will be simplified and focused on its role of setting a safety net of minimum wages and conditions. The objects and provisions relating to the role of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission will be amended to reflect these priorities. The detailed mechanism for determining safety net pay adjustments and other award minima will be prescribed through the act but left within the jurisdiction of the AIRC to establish.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To simplify awards so that they focus the safety net on minimum standards, the AIRC's jurisdiction to incorporate matters in awards is confined to certain allowable matters. All other matters will generally be determined at the enterprise or workplace level, whether in formal agreements or informally. Those agreements&mdash;actual wages and conditions and working arrangements more generally&mdash;will be determined as far as possible by agreement between employers and employees at the enterprise and workplace levels. To provide more effective choice and flexibility for parties in reaching the agreements, the new act provides for Australian workplace agreements, AWAs, and certified agreements, CAs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I move now to that very important element: freedom of association, which is something that all Australians cherish and hold very dearly. Freedom of association is a fundamental principle underpinning the government's <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> industrial relations policy. Union structures and roles will be revamped: the `conveniently belong' requirement will be abolished and the creation of enterprise unions and autonomous enterprise branches will be facilitated. Individual employees will have the freedom to join or not to join a union of their choice. Preference clauses will be outlawed and compulsory unionism or discrimination based on membership or non-membership of a union or employer association will be prohibited. Right of entry will be restricted to unions with members who have invited them into their workplace. Provision will also be made allowing for the disamalgamation of unions subject to membership support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a very important element of this legislation that freedom of association be vested with the individual, not with an organisation they are compelled to belong to so they can have a job in a particular workplace. The responsibility of the structure of their agreement should be devolved down to the workplace so that it is relevant to the place in which they are working, not relevant to the power base of a union or not relevant to an industry that might be on the other side of Australia that has no relation to the enterprise at which the agreement is being reached. That is an all&hyphen;important element of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot of articles have been written in the media since the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) introduced this parcel of legislation. I noted one media release by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, headed `ACCI welcomes reform of industrial relations system'. The media release states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commenting on the introduction by the federal Government of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Workplace Relations Bill 1996</EMPHASIS> , the Chief Executive designate, Mr. Mark Paterson, said:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">`ACCI welcomes this Bill as another step in the long process of reform of Australia's labour market to introduce more flexibility and efficiency into Australian workplaces. It is not everything that business wants, but it undeniably represents a significant advance on current arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Overall the Bill is a sensible, careful step towards a better industrial relations system more suited to modern competitive requirements. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2748"> </PARA>
<PARA>I repeat: it is more suited to modern competitive requirements. It is a very important element. As I highlighted in the opening of my address, the former government went through the process of opening up a lot of sections of the Australian economy to competition, but they cloistered the labour market. They would not address the labour market. When they attempted to address it in 1993, their political master, the ACTU, pulled the strings on them. Subsequent bills came into this place over that period of the last government that did exactly the same thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of those subsequent bills was relevant to the unfair dismissal provisions. If there is anything that desperately needs to be changed and will be changed in this bill the government is putting forward and we are debating today, if there is anything that the people of Australia are screaming out to be changed, it is the unfair dismissal provisions of the legislation the former government introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Federal unfair dismissal provisions have been complex and legalistic and have hampered job creation by discouraging employers from taking on more workers. Added to this, there has been confusion about whether federal or state laws apply. The government will replace these provisions with new laws which apply the principle of a fair go all round. Nobody is arguing or denying the fact that there are unscrupulous employers out there in the community. They are in the minority but they do exist. The people who are working in those workplaces are entitled to some form of protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The unfair dismissal provisions provided for by the previous government were just ludicrous&mdash;absolutely outrageous. During the election campaign in the lead&hyphen;up to and throughout March of this year, the unfair dismissal provisions were the one prevalent issue that was raised continually as being an impediment to employment in small business in Australia. To close down any employment prospects in small business in a centre such as Port Macquarie or Taree in my electorate&mdash;say, Port Macquarie with a population of 35,000 people, a community in which the predominant employers are small businesses&mdash; <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> you only needed the outcomes of one or two unfair dismissal cases to be made public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were two major cases of unfair dismissal that really impacted on the small business community of that area. They went through the courts and the news of the outcomes of those cases spread throughout that community like wildfire. Those outcomes just closed down absolutely any prospects of employment in that small business sector because it was not prepared to subject itself to the likelihood of that sort of court action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a country centre like Port Macquarie, a lot of people are employed in those circumstances. If they do the wrong thing and are dismissed, they will acknowledge it&mdash;and I will come to some anecdotal evidence in that regard in a minute. They will accept that they have been given notice for having done the wrong thing and will go off with the attitude of, `Okay, I've lost my job. It was my fault, I was doing something I shouldn't have been doing.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After having been through such circumstances, one particular person then went to the CES to start the paperwork process in order to apply for unemployment benefits. What advice were they given? In that particular circumstance, the person was given the advice by the CES, `Before you start the paperwork process applying for unemployment benefits, you should go and file a case for unfair dismissal'&mdash;and this is notwithstanding the fact that that employee had at first accepted responsibility for his actions for which he had been dismissed. That is fact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From that point on, the unfair dismissal case was lodged, it was upheld that that person had been unfairly dismissed and the small business person had to pay costs and compensation and re&hyphen;employ the person. Further to that, in this particular case, this person had been dismissed for stealing&mdash;not just stock off the shelves but money out of the till. There was documentary evidence provided and charges that had been laid with the police, yet the court still found that this person had been unfairly dismissed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why? Well you might ask, Mr Deputy Speaker. The reason given was that in his job statement it was not written down or specified <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2749"> that stealing was a sackable offence. Any reasonable person would expect that if they were caught stealing from their employer they would be dismissed&mdash;but not under the unfair dismissal provisions of the previous government. That is what we are addressing in this bill. We want to provide for a fair go all around.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, the government will replace those provisions, and those amendments that have just been highlighted by the shadow minister at the table, with provisions that provide the principle of a fair go all round; that protect the rights of employees who have been unfairly dismissed; that provide employees with access to a simpler process of challenging dismissals; that will be fair to both employee and employer; that will ensure that legal costs are minimised; that will discourage frivolous and malicious claims; that will be consistent with Australia's international obligations; and that will empower the AIRC to consider whether a termination of employment was harsh, unjust or unreasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These changes will apply only in the traditional area of coverage and will be confined to employees under federal awards. The expression of `a fair go all round' has been used to refer to the importance, but not inviolate ability, of the right of an employer to manage the employer's business, the nature and quality of the work in question, the circumstances surrounding a dismissal and the likely practical outcome of an order being made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that this parliament support this package of legislation. I know that the opposition have drafted a great raft of amendments to this bill&mdash;and we expected that. But the government, prior to the election, took <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this package to the people of Australia and enunciated very clearly what we would do in this area if elected to government. It highlighted how desperately the Australian economy needs this flexibility and the opening up of competition in the labour market area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people of Australia, I believe, elected this government on that basis. They gave the government the green light to go ahead with this. They have not given the opposition nor the Democrats the green light to go ahead and emasculate this bill and amend it unmercifully when it gets to the Senate. The people of Australia expect the government to go on and make this decision in good faith, for the reasons for which we were elected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill has been introduced and is being debated in the House this week. It will then move up to the Senate. If the opposition parties are to maintain any credibility in the political process in Australia, they should support this bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is always a pleasure to follow a member of the National Party&mdash;in this case the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile)&mdash;in a debate of this sort because the agrarian socialists are always such easy targets. The National Party seem to hold the view that we should deregulate all of those things which are input costs for primary producers whilst, at the same time, maintaining strict government controls on the marketing of the product that they produce. Quite simply, they think that if anything they purchase can be deregulated, it should be so that their costs are reduced. But when it comes to marketing things&mdash;whether it be wool, wheat, eggs or milk&mdash;they want to maintain boards and protections to ensure that their constituency is amongst the most protected in the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just want to remind the House of the comments made by the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) last week on that very point, because he very aptly demonstrated the hypocrisy of the National Party on these issues. We have all heard the claims of disgust which come from members on the government benches at the problems on the waterfront&mdash;and none more so than from members of the National Party who regularly <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2750"> trot that out in relation to what they see as input costs on the distribution of their goods. We get attacked on our side because we provided financial support for restructuring on the wharves. It is also the case that the Labor government provided very significant financial assistance for restructuring in the rural sector. But that appears to be a good thing in the eyes of the National Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The comparisons are interesting. The Labor Party provided $165 million to assist the restructure of the wharves. We provided $273 million to assist the rural restructure. If you look at that on a per capita basis, the average payment for each wharfie was about $37,000 per redundant wharfie. The average payment that farmers received as part of the rural adjustment scheme was $31,500, not much different. Both are schemes that I support but, as I say, it is a pleasure to follow the agrarian socialists in this debate because their hypocrisy in these matters is palpable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill is bad legislation. It is not just bad legislation; it is deceptive legislation. It is bad because it is going to hurt many thousands of ordinary Australians and, in many cases, those who can ill&hyphen;afford the burdens that this will place upon them. It is deceptive because in its presentation it purports to be something which it is not. Its advocates claim it to be a continuation of the safety mechanisms which Australian workers have come to understand and reply upon when in detail it does the opposite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some members in this parliament who have had some experience of the grassroots activities of industrial relations and the negotiating process that goes on. Those people, irrespective of which side of the House they are on, will know that the negotiating process for wages and conditions and living standards of workers is not conducted in a way as you might a contract for purchasing a vehicle or for the sale of some produce in a store.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bargaining process, the scales, is inherently tilted, with the power resting predominantly with those who employ. That is why this parliament for some 70&hyphen;odd years now has adopted legislation to try to provide <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> some redress, some balance, for ordinary Australian citizens in their workplaces. It is also why the parliament recognises that when we talk about the sale of labour it is not the sale of any commodity; it is the very basis upon which the livelihood of millions of Australians depends. It is not a contract like the sale of some other goods or services or chattels. It is about human dignity and the sorts of lives that ordinary Australians are going to be able to live with their loved ones and their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Against that background, we have traditionally put in place mechanisms to safeguard workers to provide for their collective bargaining power and to provide for an independent commission to assess agreements and to determine disputes. All that is put on its head in this legislation. I might say that the minister quite proudly proclaimed when he announced the legislation some time ago that it overturned some 70 or 80 years of legislative history that Australians had been used to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It replaces what we now know as the basis of industrial conditions primarily with a new vehicle&mdash;the Australian workplace agreement, AWA. These new workplace agreements are no doubt going to be the engine room for the changes that the ideologues in the government and their friends in business intend to pursue. These workplace agreements have in fact been given precedence over federal awards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is all good and well for those opposite to talk about the safety provisions that remain in awards. The fact is that they know and I know that over a short space of time workers will be stripped of their award conditions and covered by workplace agreements, which in this legislation you give precedence to over and above the awards. In fact, the new Australian workplace agreements will be given precedence over state awards and also state agreements. They are to be the vehicle for the changed working conditions that Australians are going to confront.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certified agreements&mdash;a longstanding arrangement in industrial practice that allows both parties to an industrial situation to come to an agreement and have it certified by the commission&mdash;are to be dramatically changed so now there is no longer going to be a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2751"> requirement that a certified agreement is not a disadvantage to the workers. We have at the moment a requirement that any certified agreement must pass the no disadvantage test, and that test is applied by the independent commission. You are going to abolish that. You are going to say that it is no longer a requirement that the commission satisfy itself that workers will not be worse off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose that is a better arrangement than what you are proposing with your workplace agreements, because when it comes to your workplace agreements there is not even a requirement that the industrial commission approve them. The workplace agreements are to be secret agreements, not to be scrutinised by the commission, not to be made available to workers' representatives or to unions on inspections, as we do now with time and wages books and of course with awards that are public. You or I or anybody can go and obtain a copy of an industrial award or an agreement and know what we are entitled to in our place of work. But, no, not with your workplace agreement. You want that to be secret. You want it to be hidden from public scrutiny and you want it to be hidden from the scrutiny of the industrial commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In dealing with these matters, rarely have government members acknowledged the fact of those circumstances that I have just described. When they do they say that employers are reasonable people who would not seek to unfairly apply that power against their employees. I happen to believe the great majority of employers do fit into that category. But I think those who regard that as the universal situation are looking for fairies at the bottom of the garden. The fact is: history demonstrates and current practice shows that there are enough employers in the community who will take advantage of those procedures to drive down the living conditions, the wages and benefits of employees which, in turn, will put enormous pressure on those decent employers who try to do the right thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been drawn to my attention that some employers are not waiting for the legislation to go through before they take advantage of what they see as the new frontier. A clothing manufacturer in my home city of Brisbane, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Sablon, has recently informed its employees in the textile and clothing industry that they will no longer be employed on a full-time basis. All of those people have now been told, `You will work Monday to Thursday only and you will work as a part-time employee. Oh, and by the way, you will lose all of your leave entitlements. You will no longer have sick leave, public holidays, annual leave, bereavement leave, maternity leave, or any other form of leave.' That has been stripped from these people. In return for working part time, in return for losing all of those leave entitlements and in return for being told that they will only be paid for working Monday to Thursday, they are to receive a 20 per cent increase in their hourly rate of pay. When you calculate that out, it means that they are $2.44 better off, having lost every form of leave they have available to them under the award. But it gets worse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well as changing their conditions in that way, the employer has said, `We are now going to require you to change the way we make garments.' For some of us who have had an interest in the textile, clothing and footwear industry for a while, we know how difficult employment conditions can be in that industry. This employer has decided to say to their employees, `No longer will you work in a group,' which is a standard procedure in TCF. A team makes a garment and one person would have responsibility for a part of that garment. They have been told, `You will now be given a responsibility each day to produce a certain number of garments yourself.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not unheard of in the industry. In fact, it is provided for in the industry. If you are required to do that work, you actually get paid more money, because it is a higher skill, greater responsibility task. That is what they have now been told they are going to do, as well as lose all those benefits I have just mentioned. They have now been given a higher responsibility, but did they get a higher rate of pay? No. These people are being required to undertake work for which, if they were getting the benefit of the award, they would be $50 a week better off.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2752">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This employer has stripped them of their leave entitlements and of full-time employment status and has effectively reduced their pay by $50 a week. Just to cap it off, it was said to the employees, `Any mistake you make in the production of that garment you fix in your time. You fix it in your own time.' I suppose that is what Friday is for. That is why they do not get paid to work on Friday. Friday is obviously the day the employer thinks they come back to fix the garments for nothing. That is the sort of procedure which is being applied by employers today because they anticipate what you are going to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are not alone. Recently, representatives of the TCF union went to another clothing manufacturer in Queensland, Mike O'Leary, who, I must say, makes a number of high fashion designer clothes amongst other sporting apparel. Following the visit by the union and Australian Industrial Relations Commission representatives, the employer sacked the 10 staff that were working there full time and said, `Well, I'll do it all through outwork now.' The industrial commission and the union went there to inspect the problems at that factory and what was the employer's response? Sack the lot of them. That is your brave new world. They are the conditions of employment that will apply. In spite of whatever wrapping you want to put on it in this debate, they are precisely the conditions that will apply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those of us that have actually been involved in workplace negotiations and dealings with employers for some years, we know that to be the case. It is a pity that some on the government benches do not have that experience or, if they do, have a blinkered view of those things. Those two examples I have given are factual cases of what is transpiring with employers anticipating your legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that the union in Queensland is not lying down about those matters. I am sure they will be doing what they can to seek redress. In fact, I know they will. Of course, that redress relies upon an industrial commission and an award structure which is paramount. You are going to destroy both of those things. You will, in this legislation, allow <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> employers like Sablon and Mike O'Leary to put people on Australian workplace agreements that are not subject to scrutiny by the union.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, unions are prevented from even coming in and  negotiating unless one of the members of the union in that workshop puts in a request in writing. Put yourself in the place of those people who work at Mike O'Leary&mdash;or used to&mdash;who have a concern and want the union to come in there to help them. Before the union will be allowed in the front door, this bill that you are putting up will require that person to write a letter saying that they want their union representative to come to help them in the negotiations. Last time they had someone from the union come&mdash;not just by themselves but with the industrial commission, a formal industrial commission presence&mdash;the employer sacked the lot of them. That is the real world, folks. And you are going to subject every worker to that procedure. You should be ashamed of it. It will do great harm to many thousands of workers and, I might say, to many people that can ill afford it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This industry, as we all know, is dominated by female employees. It has also become heavily dominated by people from non-English&hyphen;speaking backgrounds. That was the case with one of these firms. These are people who are easily intimidated and stood over by those who do not have the high principles and ideals that all of us in this chamber would espouse. These are vulnerable people who require the protection of a union and an industrial commission. You are about to strip that from them and you should be ashamed of it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed. Let me move to a couple of other matters in the three minutes or so that are left to me in this debate. It is important to note that in your legislation you allow for state agreements to prevail over federal awards. That is a significant change. It turns on its head the very basis of the federal government's constitutional authority. Whether it is in industrial relations or in any other area, the principle upon which this parliament has been established is that where Commonwealth law and state law conflict the Commonwealth law prevails. It has been a very necessary requirement in relation to industrial relations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You turn that on its head here and you do it for the most base of political reasons. You do it to pander to the likes of Jeffrey Kennett and Richard Court, who want to impose state draconian industrial laws but have found that the workers in their states do not want to hang around for that draconian law and have shifted into federal jurisdiction. By this bill you have stripped them of that opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You talk a lot about freedom of choice. Where is the freedom of choice that you are denying those workers now? Where is the freedom of choice you are denying them to have federal protection against draconian state laws? You are stripping those people of that right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have also pointed out that in this bill state agreements need not comply with the Commonwealth minimum conditions&mdash;another loophole that undermines your safety net. Your safety net is a sham; it is deceptive. There was the example recently of how other employers will deal with these matters&mdash;and I probably should have mentioned this in the context of those other firms&mdash;such as the Tweed Valley employer the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) referred to in his address who has actually told his employees that contact with the union is `gross misconduct warranting dismissal'. How many employers are going to say that to their employees? Where is the freedom of choice? Of course, it does not exist. It does not exist because of the inherent imbalance in the power relationship in the workplace. You are denying workers throughout Australia the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> balance against that inherent power relationship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not have time to say a great deal about unfair dismissal, but I do wish to point out that the examples that are regularly touted by members of the government and their employer friends relate to the provisions in the federal act prior to its amendment last year or to state legislation in the case of Queensland, which did not make the adjustments that we did last year. Those examples, which I do not pretend were right, we fixed. There is no justification for the changes you are proposing in relation to unfair dismissals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The abolition of TUTA is a short&hyphen;sighted decision which most employers involved in long&hyphen;term industrial relations would not support. Your independent contractor provisions are designed to assist people such as troubleshooters again to deny workers legitimate access to awards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All this is against a background of industrial peace. Over the last three months of the Labor government, we had record low industrial disputes: 79 days lost per 1,000 workers compared with 797 when you were in office, to the year ending February. To the year ending January, we had 80 days per 1,000 workers; the January that you were last in office it was 832 days&mdash;10 times more. We have had industrial peace; we have  had stability. There is no justification for the bill and it should be defeated. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

That is the truth, and that is a tragedy because you have had to provide government assistance to give people enough living wages to get off the dole. Your award system for those people you cry crocodile tears about, those people from whom you demand $150 or $200 per week in compulsory union fees plus levies, are better off on the dole.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He has a little, quiet chat with his mate because he does not really want to hear that reality. Let me repeat it to you. Do you deny this? Mr Deputy Speaker, will he deny to you that lower award workers&mdash;when they look day by day at the wages your award system delivers them&mdash;work out that it is better to be on the dole? You see them on television and they tell you just that. That is how good your system is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, you will put up this great bogey about Western Australia's award conditions. I spoke to a woman in South Australia the other day whose son, a relatively unskilled worker, had just got a job in the Western Australian goldfields at $1,000 per week. He and thousands of other workers have not left New South Wales and other places and travelled over to Western Australia in recent times to be exploited. They love the sort of exploitation that gives them $1,000 a week. And what has happened in our mining regions? You have sacked every one of your organisers in the AWU in Kalgoorlie. Why? Because those blokes earning $1,000 a week do not want your help any more. You cannot get them in the union movement. Your candidate in Kalgoorlie, Ian Taylor, blamed it all on the fringe benefits tax and `fly in, fly out'.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I can tell you that they did and I think he ran third. They have found that the ACTU invention of the fringe benefits tax is costing them union membership all over the place. I think that is a great irony.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an interesting point that my maiden speech, delivered to this House on 26 February 1981&mdash;I think that was some time around when the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) was born&mdash;to be found in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> page 302, addressed the industrial relations system. And I did it for good reason. For years, I have been active in employing people, dealing with them on a grassroots basis in industrial relations. I did it as a hotel proprietor, caravan park proprietor, earthmoving company proprietor and trucking company proprietor. As the chairman of the local authority, the workers used to come to me and say, `We've got to go 150 miles in the bush and we've got a seven&hyphen; or eight&hyphen;day job. Can we please stay out there over the weekend and grab our two days of holiday when we get back and have it during the week?' To which I would say yes and the union would say no.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They had to drive all the way back into town on Friday night, spend the weekend in town and drive back to do two more days work in the bush and then come back again. They did not want it. They could stay up there if the shire paid them double time. The shire was not going to pay them double time. They said, `Come home.' It was great. What the workers wanted was totally ignored.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But my experience is pretty extensive. It is not my business, but I still keep a close interest in the activities of my two older children, who just happen to give jobs to 40 people in a garden centre and in the nursery production industry today. We know a bit about people. We know a bit about employing them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I entered this parliament I made some pretty interesting comments in the context of today's debate. I am delighted to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2755"> think that anybody who chooses to read that speech would discover how close I am to today's events 16 years later. In that speech I complained about the failure of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904, one of the first acts of the federal parliament after its formation, to prevent strikes. I said at the time that people brought that act in as a sunset clause on strikes. It was a system that allowed people to get together and work out their differences. Of course, it clearly failed. It clearly failed because, for a start, the judges and others who were put into that task failed to take proper notice of section 40, which said, in part, that the commission shall act in accordance with equity, good conscience and the substantial merits of the case. We actually had commissioners defending themselves on the grounds that, notwithstanding that that was a requirement upon themselves, they found that the industrial situation was worthy of their attention. In other words, people were on strike in contravention of the act, but the only way to resolve the problem and get them back to work was to pay them some money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I complained of the change within the trade union movement from one where leadership came from the workers' ranks to it becoming a career service of university trained bureaucrats. I complained about that 15 years ago. Evidence has been given by other speakers as to how real that situation is today and how the career structure has progressed to your retirement package, which is a job here in the federal parliament. I pointed out that workers did not profit from  perennial wage increases that also increased their taxes and their grocery and clothing prices at a higher rate than their own wage increase. Those things were referred to as bracket creep and inflation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> As we know from Mr Keating's own boasting, the Keating government stopped that process of inflation and the consequent bracket creep, principally achieved by dismantling the tariff system. Now workers can buy cheap Chinese clothing but frequently have to use their dole cheque to buy it. The result of that process and the previous process of putting up wages without productivity offsets was that people lost their jobs. I was interest ed in the previous speaker's comments when he was complaining about someone saying that they were moving people in the clothing sector to outwork. Whether that is a good idea or bad, those Australians still have a job. Most of our clothing manufacturers, due to the activities of the union movement in Australia, have moved to China. Have a look at the number of Australian brand names you now buy at K-Mart which are underwritten with `Made in China'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Keating award system has, as I said, been so successful that all those on lower levels of pay are now better off on the dole. I warned against financing unproductive wage increases by, to use my words, digging holes in the ground&mdash;in other words, exploiting our national resources to pay for unproductive wage increases. As I warned at the time, this short-term policy has now been overrun by international competition in the resource area. In the last 10 or 12 years we have financed this process of unproductive wage increases and extended non-working periods, et cetera by simply borrowing money from the rest of the world. We know what that has achieved for us. It is just outrageous to think that this is happening to this nation, with the level of resources we have&mdash;over $200 billion in real money, not this so-called net arrangement. That is the situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those on the other side of the House are frantic because the institution of the trade union movement is at risk. I previously referred to the structures that occurred and how those people who form the trade union bureaucracy have little experience in the workplace. It was quoted&mdash;I believe it to be correct&mdash;that the now member for Batman, Martin Ferguson, past president of the ACTU, ably assisted by Jennie George, Tim Pallas and Bill Kelty, have had an aggregate of six years working time outside the trade union bureaucracy. That is an average of 15 months each out there in the real world. Goodness knows what that experience was. I doubt that it was very productive. The stock&hyphen;in&hyphen;trade of the trade union bureaucrat is, `You need my protection.' We heard about it today; they are wringing their hands. Their protection has been such that the minimum award worker is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2756"> better off on the dole. You have to have this bureaucratic structure. They are saying, `You need me,' when they are really saying that I need a bureaucratic structure which guarantees my future with a minimum of effort on my behalf.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the award system and the old national wage cases, what a great job it was for a trade union bureaucrat. You went back to your office, you worked out a pay increase and you wandered off to the arbitration commission, which was formed of your mates. We had this great triumvirate arrangement. You had employer reps, who were part of the industrial relations club, and you had union reps. They used to swap occasionally, as most would know, and then of course they were promoted to the various commissions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Ian Viner was our minister under the Fraser government and he came to our backbench committee, he was going to promote some people into the commission. He assured us that they were all highly experienced&mdash;they had been in the industrial sector for years. I said to him, `Is it possible we can get somebody in there who knows nothing about industrial relations but does understand the words in the act that charge the commission to make its decisions according to equity, good conscience and the substantial merits of the case?' I thought some women who had just seen their kids grow up would be ideal, because they would have had great experience in sorting out the fights amongst juveniles. I thought they would have done a great job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that it was just so easy. You did not have to go and service the members. You did not have to go and see what their real problems were. You just forced them to pay. One of the most outrageous aspects of Australian society has been no ticket, no start. It is the concept of telling someone they have to buy a job. I tell you what: if they went out today and even consulted some of those grassroots people, they will have the membership but they hate those levies. They are imposed as compulsorily as are the actual membership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is my view that, whilst we have consumer legislation to protect you from these encyclopedia salesmen and the stainless steel pot </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA>salesmen, it is time we had consumer legislation to give people protection from the service provider known as a trade union bureaucrat. Of course, whilst we have this approach to consumerism, as soon as you go and buy services from a trade union, don't let us have any consumer law there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have relied heavily on scare campaigns with the Australian work force, but the Australian work force has not been very receptive in recent times to all this talk. While they are all in here trying to protect the jobs that they used to have and may have to return to&mdash;they might be halved again at the next election&mdash;and while they are all in here worrying about it, those who are left out there in the real world are having great difficulty selling their services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The statistics provided by the ABS tell me that in the private sector, the real world, they now have 26 per cent of the work force as members. That is how good they are. That 26 per cent would nearly all be people in the transport sector and a couple of others who still cannot get a job without a union ticket. In the public sector it is 62 per cent, and that demonstrates, amongst other things, that a lot of the trade union people are in the position of granting people jobs. I can tell you that, if you do not sign the application for union membership in many jobs that you apply for in the public sector, you simply do not get on the short list.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The figure would halve, at best, when our legislation which prevents this practice is in place. We are just giving Australian people a choice by telling them that they have a right to join or not to join. They have a right to say, `Well, what's in it for me? I do not want all of these spectacular wage increases you give me that push me into a higher tax bracket and put up the cost of the baked beans down at the supermarket and leave me with nothing.' They want some real wage increases, and they want them by achieving productivity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know about the election results up at Weipa. We know about all the fuss. Jennie George went up there and said, `I've done a great job for the workers. I have the right to sign off for 70 of them out of 700.' But they <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2757"> still have the same conditions they had before all the fuss. The workers have not gained a thing; Jennie has. Her job is a little more secure. The reality is that the workers have gained nothing, and they demonstrated that in their vote up there when we had this massive swing to our side. They are not silly. I have had the phone calls. I have mixed with these people. I have drunk with them, I have served them beer, I know how they think; and I have employed them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I heard the member for Batman telling us that the problems are with the young, with migrants and with women. Let me tell you what happened when I sat down with a group of women. I employed thousands of women in the hotel industry, and I had one of the greatest lessons in all my life when I did a workplace agreement about 30 years ago. We did not have to worry too much about unions in the town where I was. In Carnarvon there was 300 miles of dirt road, and the union people refused to drive up over that rough road to help any worker. They used to ring me up and say, `Send the union fees down. I don't want to come.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality was that I got fed up with the complexity of the system. So we added up all the cost, divided it by the productive hours worked and said to the staff, `What about a flat hourly rate of X?' They said, `That much? That's a lot of money,' as they had just complained about it. We said, `There's nothing else. That's everything.' They said, `We'll take it; it's beaut.' Then I said, `How are you going to work out the rosters? Some are going to work at night&hyphen;time, which used to be at a higher rate, and some are going to work in the daytime.' They said, `Leave that to us,' and they came back with the rosters. The married women had all the night work and the weekend work, and the single girls had all the day work. Why do you think they did that? You do not have to be Einstein to work it out. The married women wanted the night work and the weekend work so that they had husbands at home to look after the children. The single girls went out on the town. Everybody was happy.</PARA>

They would drive off to Perth with a semitrailer or road train. They would know when they left what they were going to get when they got back.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We used to add a bit of a sweetener&mdash;it was called incentive. We used to give them $5 a tonne on any back loading they got, and they all got it. They knew where to go, and they took it because that was an incentive and a productivity based program. There is all this business that you have to have Bill Kelty to hold your hand while you negotiate. These people were good negotiators: they knew their value and they always got it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, we talk about the young. The award system used to prevent employers taking on apprentices. There was a strict ratio between full&hyphen;time employees and apprentices. You could not take on a few more kids and give them a chance. Oh no; the union used to police it vigorously. So much for their interest in kids! The kids did not pay full union fees. Why would you want them around the place?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about migrants? I never had a trade union representative ask me whether I would employ a migrant. And who invented the White Australia policy, which was purely anti&hyphen;migrant? It was your people. Can you remember what Cocky Calwell said? I am too embarrassed to repeat it. The reality is that it was your legislation, because you did not want immigrants. You did not want anybody breaking up the cosy relationship. I could go on. You made a mess of the system. It was all designed to protect the union bureaucracy, and that is why you are worried about this legislation. There is not one scrap of evidence in Western Australia that people are being exploited.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Nothing divides the government and the opposition more than our views in regard to industrial relations. The Australian Labor Party has always believed in the fundamental freedom for labour to organise. This is a tradition that stretches back to the Tolpuddle Martyrs and has been part of Australia's history since settlement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the government proposes under the ubiquitous title of labour market reform is an attack on these fundamental freedoms. People may say that this is an overdramatisation, but one has only to peruse the bill that is before the House, the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill, to reach the same conclusion as I have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In government, we provided the opportunity for flexibility and for enterprise bargaining, but always within the framework of the Industrial Relations Commission. Through its conciliation and arbitration process, Australia has developed a unique brand of labour relations. We do not need to be a copy of Thatcherite Britain or the deregulated United States. Our system of industrial relations has brought about prosperity, but even more importantly it has given all Australians a sense of fairness that has led us all to believe in the principle of a fair day's pay for a fair day's work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tenet of this bill is that someone else will determine what your labour is worth by an arbitrary contract, with no access to proper redress if the contract offered is not fair or just. You have to ask yourself the simple question: how can a 16&hyphen;year&hyphen;old checkout operator have the capacity to negotiate with Coles Myer or Woolworths an individual contract for their remuneration? To believe they have the capacity is an insult to them and to the intelligence of the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am deeply concerned about how this bill will affect young people not only in my electorate but across the country. Indeed, I would like to point out to the 15,000 young people in the electorate of Rankin that this government has already let them down. It has already been articulated that young people will be worse off under this government. We <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have heard that independent young people under 18 can expect to earn as little as $3.05 an hour. We have heard that training has to be approved by a special `training authority'. The law says that this can be anyone the minister says it is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is dangerous territory for the coalition government to be treading on. Under the plan of the Prime Minister, John Howard, employers only have to pay workers for time on the job that they say is `productive'. This, of course, allows for a young person to be in the trap of being made to work a full week but receive as little as only two days pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to explain to the House during this debate how, from a personal view, this legislation concerns me. I know first&hyphen;hand the hard work that many apprentices go through to achieve their qualifications. I am proud to say my eldest son is in the fourth year of his apprenticeship to become a motor mechanic. I would like to state, if I may be so bold, that he is showing every sign of being a first&hyphen;class motor mechanic. He works for a very honest and reputable company which treats their employees very well. He has succeeded so far as a result of his own ability and the chance to work for a fair day's pay. He has been able to do the required assessment, study and practical requirements whilst earning a decent wage. I stress that apprentices are still not earning a fortune.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It disturbs me greatly that, under the proposed changes, someone like my own son could be greatly disadvantaged. Let me make it clear that not only is it possible under this legislation for a young person's wage to be cut because of their age but it could be cut again due to the training discount being applied to junior rates and not to full pay rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have already stated, the government's bill allows for employers to decide how much of the time spent at work is `productive' and how much is training. I might add that the training can take place entirely on the job. This is a recipe for disaster for young people across Australia. In Queensland alone, there are about 30,000 people currently in training schemes. I challenge my fellow Queensland members from the other side to come into this <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2759"> chamber and defend the young people of Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know that the Prime Minister will do anything to make the youth unemployment figures look better under his government. But the answer is not to cut the take&hyphen;home pay of young people, and it is certainly not the answer to water down the level of training for young people. What this bill is about is denying young people a basic Australian fair go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have already seen the cutbacks in funding for skillshare. Over the years, I have worked closely with a number of skillshares in my electorate, as I am sure many members on both sides of the House have. The Inala South&hyphen;West Skillshare in my electorate has done an excellent job in working with the community to find employment for many long-term unemployed people. The goodwill that has been generated with businesses and with organisations like the Inala South&hyphen;West Skillshare, Access Inc. and the Browns Plains Skillshare, which are all in my electorate, has taken a long time to develop.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the proposed cutbacks in skillshare funding already announced by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, local residents have been outraged. There is a big concern that this important job training and skills training base will just disappear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, if you factor in the ramifications and effects of this bill, young people are right to question the commitment by this government to the youth of Australia. This bill limits the choice of young people. It is back to the bad old days of `the master and his apprentice'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What it does is take away the right of a young person to speak out and have any say over their future. I am a strong believer that young people should be paid for what they can do, not how old they are. In areas like Woodridge, Inala and Browns Plains in my electorate, young people, thanks to the Labor Party and the Working Nation program, were able to receive training and skills to enable them to have a job. This bill, paralleled with cutbacks in skillshare funding in my electorate, jeopardises their future employment <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> prospects. People in areas like Logan City are definitely scared&mdash;scared of what is to come, and increasingly scared of this Howard government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the government has failed to realise is that an ideologically driven industrial relations policy does not build a better Australia. It may, in the government's view, build a more competitive economy. It is true that if we paid people $1 per hour we would be able to compete against cheap labour markets. But is this the sort of Australia we want or is it even the sort of Australia this government wants? Certainly, unscrupulous employers will see it as the sort of Australia they want. This is the very reason unions were formed in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that the premise the government's legislation is based upon is one that all employers are kind-hearted, generous, caring, thoughtful and loving and have only the best interests of their employees at heart! I hate to disillusion members opposite, but there is a real world out there where this is simply not the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is a recipe for the creation of a class of working poor&mdash;people with no right to object because they are not empowered, people who must continue to work for rates of pay that do not provide them with even the basics, people who will be forgotten in your brave new world of workplace reform. Australia must become a more internationally competitive place. It has become that under the Hawke and Keating governments. However, we have not left behind those Australians that technology and workplace reform have deprived of ready access to work opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should be proud of the fact that Australia, by international standards, is a fair and just society. We do have a social security net that protects the weak and the sick in times of duress. These are the fundamentals in which the Labor Party believes. And, while some members opposite may profess the same views, their support for this legislation clearly indicates the opposite. Good old&hyphen;fashioned union bashing may be great sport at the local branches of the Liberal and National parties, but it is as far from reality as were the plans <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2760"> of the grand old men of the Communist Party of Australia for a workers' revolution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thankfully, Australia has always walked a middle path. Until now, even members of the coalition parties believed in that middle path. Now, under the directorship of the member for Flinders, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith)&mdash;a person, I might add, with no experience in the industrial work force; a suburban lawyer whose views were formed at the local New Right think tank&mdash;we now face a piece of legislation that has no basis in reality or any place in the Australia I want my children to inherit. You will come to realise this over time when you hear from your constituents the stories of exploitation and unfair dismissal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You will not be able to hide behind the excuse that it was the government that did it, because you will have to vote on this bill and we will divide time and time again, clause by clause, amendment by amendment until we force the exposure of every one of you opposite as an opponent of ordinary working men and women of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am proud to be a member of the Australian Workers Union, but I do not mount an argument in defence of entrenched union power. Some trade unions in this country have much to answer for. Many have become isolated and out of touch with their membership, but the government has given them the cause they have been looking for&mdash;a cause that will unite labour in this country like never before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If these unions had been in touch with the broad rank and file of their membership, this bill would not have been able to have been introduced. We as the Labor Party, with its traditions and its foundation in the roots of the labour movement, acknowledge that many trade union members turned against us on 2 March. But already many of those people can see that this is a traditional old style anti-union conservative Liberal government&mdash;in fact, so driven by ideology it is more anti-union than Bob Menzies or Jack McEwen would have ever dreamed of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> We have also heard from members opposite the plaintive cry that this legislation is in the interests of small business. What utter non sense! If members opposite really understood small and medium sized enterprise, they would understand that the vast majority of Australian businesses either employ no&hyphen;one outside the family unit or, if they do, they employ a small number of people who are valued as part of the team.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the years when I was Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs, it was only the so-called and self-appointed spokesmen for small business who claimed industrial relations was the major issue for small business. You occasionally met someone&mdash;like ASBA's Chairman, Peter Boyle&mdash;who claimed all the problems of the world could be fixed with the abolition of unions. Thankfully, that view was in the minute minority, but unfortunately people like Boyle have access to Liberal politicians such as Kennett, Costello and Reith.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister, who has no real understanding of small business, has listened to these politicians and so-called small business leaders and fitted their view to his own ideology. The Prime Minister's ideology is driven by small&hyphen;mindedness and a lifetime antagonism to the organised labour movement. I do believe the Prime Minister is totally wrong if he believes he is helping Australian small business through this Workplace Relations Bill and Other Legislation Amendment Bill whilst at the same time refusing to act on the Trade Practices Amendment (Better Business Conduct) Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Small business is the one sector of our society that understands its most valuable asset is its own employees. Small business is about sales and without good employees committed to the business and its prosperity you will not be successful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I challenge the Prime Minister not to listen to the extremists in this debate but to go and talk to the real small businesses&mdash;to those that are value adding and to those that are exporting. These are the small businesses that are growing in our economy. These are the small businesses that prospered under Labor. These are the small businesses which will make us an internationally competitive economy. Frankly, these are the businesses which think that the government's legislation is just a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2761"> recipe for confrontation and a return to the industrial anarchy of the 1960s and 1970s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rightly or wrongly, we have already seen confrontation in our streets by employees in the building industry and the waterfront. The Prime Minister and his Minister for Industrial Relations may think this is a good dose of old hairy chest beating, but the image it creates of Australia both nationally and internationally is of a country that has not learned the lessons of its past.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The members opposite have made much of the impact of the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill on women. Let us look at that impact. For years women have had to have their conditions of employment negotiated by those bastions of full-time male workers&mdash;the unions. What has that achieved? It has achieved awards where part-time employment is not allowed at all, awards where there is a limit on the number of regular part-timers or awards where part-time work is only for those who can work at least 16 hours a week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about the woman who wants to get the kids off to school, complete the various tasks of motherhood, work for two or three hours over lunch for some extra cash to make ends meet and finish in time to pick the kids up? She has to get casual work, which does not have any job security, predictability of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> hours or access to conditions such as personal leave or maternity leave. There is no way this government will take maternity leave out of the awards, despite the scaremongering of those opposite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For a woman who has to make child&hyphen; or elder&hyphen;care arrangements, knowledge that you will be earning a wage during the hours you have arranged for a carer is important. The opposition would have us believe that this bill will `casualise' the work force. What a joke!  What a bunch of hypocrites! What a mob of scaremongers!</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GK6">Miss JACKIE KELLY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry, Mr Deputy Speaker, I withdraw the word. The truth is that from 1986 to 1995 the number of casual workers grew from 17 per cent to 24 per cent, as the unions' traditional full-time male constituency made part-time work less and less attractive for employers and the average family wage lagged behind the male wage, as the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) adequately pointed out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> There are 17 women in this parliament who will be monitoring the average weekly wage of females, and we will do a lot more than the unrepresentative number of token women on the opposite side have done in the past. This is a fresh opportunity for women to negotiate employment that suits their lifestyle. No limit will be placed on the number or proportion of part-time jobs an employer can offer. The opportunities, choice and protection of women in the labour market are boundless. And we are not going back. Anyone who thinks that women are going to be in decreasing numbers in the work force in future should think again. There is change happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Women no longer have to retire to a family life even when the kids are at school. They can take on a regular part-time job during the day which comes with all the leave and training entitlements of regular work. They can negotiate employment-placed child care. They can vary their hours to suit their children as they go from primary to secondary <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2762"> school and once their children are all grown up they are not disadvantaged by starting out to look for employment with no modern skills or recent work experience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Women are the big winners in the legislation because they can negotiate flexible working arrangements such as flexitime, job sharing, home based work, leave in lieu, paid parental leave or work based child care. There can be access to training and career development for part-time workers with older families who may be considering returning to work full time in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The awards will ensure 18 subject areas such as pay, long service leave, personal carers leave, sick leave, family leave, bereavement leave and maternity leave. Yes, maternity leave! Despite the opposition's claims that this will be lost, it is in fact a basic award and it will not be removed from the basic award. Adoption leave, compassionate leave and jury service are also basic entitlements, as is the 52-week parental or adoption leave without pay after 12 months of normal service. Recreation leave, 12 days personal leave and carers leave are also ensured under the awards. These are in excess of most existing entitlements in federal awards. This will particularly benefit women workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> By restricting awards to basics it simplifies the agreements, makes them more readable and therefore easier to understand. It shifts the focus of the system to the relationship between the employer and the employee at the enterprise level. The union's role is to assist the Employment Advocate in dissemination of information on negotiating agreements. The advising and assisting function of the Employment Advocate can be contracted out, providing for non-government community organisations to be involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Women from non-English speaking backgrounds often feel more comfortable seeking help from community based organisations rather than bureaucratic government ones. This process of negotiating an agreement is important. Knowledge of types of agreement is essential for workers to be able to negotiate. This can be done by the employer, the union or the Employment Advocate or his agent. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some services offered by the Employment Advocate include telephone inquiries for employers and employees, assistance to employees to compare their entitlements under awards with their current and proposed workplace agreements, information packages, model clauses and guidelines on negotiating an agreement. This information dissemination is vital to employers and employees alike.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do not let the opposition scaremongering convince anyone that workers will not be protected from unfair dismissal. Of course this will remain. People unfairly dismissed will be given their old job back or will be given financial compensation. But someone who steals from their employer will not be protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Employers are prohibited from dismissing people on the grounds of sex, marital status, number of kids, pregnancy or temporary absences for injury and illness. The work value `equal pay for equal work' applies to all awards and agreements. There will be clear and efficient machinery for dealing with the alleged discrimination against women in over&hyphen;award payments. There are 17 women in this the parliament monitoring any slippage in women's wages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those on the other side are quick to acknowledge that the average weekly wage for females in Australia is below the national average for males. Yet they had 13 years to rectify this. Like all their rhetoric on equal representation and quotas, they are big on words but very slow to act. They keep talking about it but they achieve very little. They have no plans for industrial relations reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am a great believer in `if it ain't broke don't fix it', but the labour accord, the labour market programs and the awards did not get equality for women. So it is broke. And we are going to do something about fixing it. All the opposition can do is sit on their hands and oppose for opposition's sake.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The voices of women opposite and the voices of women in union affairs&mdash;those male bastions of full-time workers rights&mdash;have gone unheard. But never again. We have given the women the opportunity to do it themselves. If the unions are on the ball and serious about alerting members to their <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2763"> rights&mdash;instead of using union membership as a stepping stone to parliament&mdash;then they will embrace this legislation and start the dissemination of information that will advantage the members in negotiating a workplace agreement that suits women's lifestyle and family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those opposite claim to represent the ordinary workers of this country. If that is the case, how come I am on this side of the House? From the brick veneer homes of the lower Blue Mountains and Penrith, those ordinary workers joined me on 2 March to protest against a government that claimed to represent the ordinary worker but instead chased their own career agendas, from union movements to parliament. They had 13 years to work it out. Even their own enterprise agreements were opposed for opposition's sake.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A classic case before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission involved J.K. Williams Contracting in my electorate. They employed 35 people, 27 of whom are currently employed under the J.K. Williams Contracting Pty Ltd enterprise agreement. They were opposed on every aspect and every issue of that agreement through the courts at terrific expense. They had to employ two different consultants and a number of different negotiation agencies, including lawyers. It was $300,000 later when the employees and employers were allowed to continue with the agreement that they had bargained on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The union's involvement was simply opposition for opposition's sake. It is a trap for employers and employees alike: if you negotiate an agreement, you must do so from a strong position of information and knowledge. The unions should be backing that by giving to members information on their rights and bargaining power and positions. They should not just oppose for opposition's sake.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This workplace relations bill has a number of advantages for females. It has a number of advantages for employees who wish to work along more flexible lines. I endorse all the amendments fully. I hope that we can come to some arrangement to get this through the Senate before the end of the next session.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Workplace Relations and Other Legislation <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Amendment Bill is one of the most important pieces of legislation to be introduced into this place by the new coalition government. It was brought in on 23 May. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s it was the coalition parties which drove the pace of industrial relations reform by continually pushing out the boundaries of acceptable policy discussion. Coalition industrial relations spokesmen, such as Neil Brown QC and John Howard, the now Prime Minister, bore the brunt of misinformation and intimidation from the Labor government and its trade union mates over that period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the coalition, to their great credit, continued to further expand the boundaries of acceptable industrial relations policy. In doing so, the coalition virtually dragged the Labor Party kicking and screaming down the path of labour market reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the problems is that Labor and, even more so, the union movement have always been too slow in recognising the need for meaningful reform. They have held firm to the centralised system, only allowing change at the edges. The irony is that Labor was quick to deregulate the financial sector and quick to reduce tariff protection for Australian industry but, at the same time, would not contemplate serious reform of the labour market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Harvester judgment of 1907, handed down by Mr Justice Higgins of the Arbitration Court, was the trigger for developing a tariff based system of protection for Australian industry. It went along these lines: if employers were to accept the system of arbitration and the concept of a basic wage, the rest of the community required protection from imports so that they could afford to pay the higher rates of pay. In other words, it was a trade-off. That was the genesis of the system that has developed to this day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Harvester judgment led to the centralised concept of the wage fixing system. It made the need for a liveable wage more important than the capacity of an employer to meet the wages bills. For Higgins, it was better for a firm to go broke  than to not pay a liveable wage. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, the capacity to pay argument is still one that the union movement has difficulty <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2764"> with. However, since the early 1980s, and with the increased exposure of Australian enterprises to international competitive pressures, the capacity to pay issue could no longer be ignored.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Internationalisation of markets has also highlighted the weakness of the centralised wage fixing system. It has become increasingly clear that in a globally competitive environment enterprises have to develop growth strategies which meet the needs of the individual enterprise. This includes setting wages and conditions at the enterprise level. As I have said, the only problem with this type of reform is that neither managers nor union delegates have had the expertise to undertake enterprise bargaining. Nor did they want all too often to take responsibility for their own work environment; it was too cushy under the old system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is much easier to leave these matters to the peak employer and trade union bodies who argue their cases before the various industrial relations commissions, which in turn make the final decisions. In the latter part of the 1980s, the ALP did start to feel the pressure to undertake labour market programs, however. With the onset of the restructuring and associated efficiency principles and later the structural efficiency principle, an element of enterprise bargaining was introduced within the centralised wage fixing system. It was very basic and arguably ineffective, but nevertheless it was beginning to be seen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These principles were part of Labor's accord process, and it was of little surprise that they were a failure in achieving real or lasting productivity gains. However, one benefit was that many managers were forced to manage and take total responsibility for their workplace. They had to examine all aspects of their workplace's operation and actually talk to their work force about operational matters, not just exchange their previous courtesies and pleasantries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Paul Keating realised the failure of Labor's industrial relations tinkering when he addressed the Institute of Directors in 1993 and proposed reforms which are similar to those in the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill, which is under <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> discussion today. Mr Keating advocated using awards as a safety net and negotiating wages and conditions in the workplace. However, as you will recall, I am sure, Mr Deputy Speaker, as events unfolded neither Mr Keating nor the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith (Mr Brereton) had the stomach to introduce the necessary reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The provisions of this bill were promised by the coalition at the most recent election. There does not appear to me to be any sleight of hand in this legislation, although I might just observe that it is sloppy drafting of legislation when the bill was introduced only last week and we have several pages of amendments coming into the House this day. Whoever was responsible deserves condemnation for not getting it right the first time.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will say this for the coalition&mdash;that all was revealed to the Australian people about its proposals in this direction before the last poll.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill is about fairness and choice, it is about increased productivity and competitiveness and it is about increased real wages and employment growth. It is not as revolutionary as Jobsback, nor is it as radical as New Zealand's and Victoria's reforming legislation. Neither does it go as far as many business leaders have suggested it should, although I must say that, when I hear their urgings from time to time and when they are put to the test in the breach, they are not to be found on many occasions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I am also sure that this bill will not be the last word in labour market reform under this government or subsequent governments. The fact is that this bill is an admirable beginning because it will not only ensure satisfactory levels of protection to employees but also provide the reassurance that workers cannot be worse off, in conjunction with much needed flexibility to improve productivity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Included in the claimed reforms are: conversion of awards into a system of minimum conditions; new unfair dismissal rules; the introduction of Australian workplace agreements; creation of the Office of the Employment Advocate to assist both employers and employees to comply with their obligations; a legislative right to freedom of association, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2765"> along with the end of preference clauses in awards and enterprise agreements; the right to strike and lock out during the bargaining period; and, lastly, the reinclusion in the Trade Practices Act of sections 45D and E, which prohibit secondary boycotts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simplification and transformation over time of the award system into a set of minimum conditions will produce the necessary framework for detailed terms of employment to be determined at the workplace and not at the peak industry or occupational level. It is an essential element in changing the prevailing adversarial mind&hyphen;set to a more cooperative and mutually beneficial approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The arbitration system produced winners and losers, although in the long term all may be said to have been losers. National productivity and real increases in national wealth can be achieved only when Australian workplaces adopt a cooperative mind&hyphen;set. Capacity to pay is, of course, the most important determinant in setting wages and conditions&mdash;it is as simple as that. However, given increases in productivity and profitability, workers deserve their slice of the action. They deserve higher real wages when those conditions of higher profitability and productivity prevail. When workers and managers bargain together, they gain an appreciation of the priorities of the other and should be able to narrow their differences. Workers have many of the answers to improving productivity but, because in the past they have not been consulted or do not feel they are part of a bigger team, their expertise has all too often been ignored. Workers need to be included in the decision making process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Enterprise agreements, whether they are the new Australian workplace agreements&mdash;abbreviated to AWA&mdash;or certified agreements, provide a formal process by which pay and conditions can be determined. Informal wages setting via the old system of above&hyphen;award payments can also continue to operate. In encouraging enterprise bargaining, the government has made it clear that no employee will be forced to switch from their award. The award system will form a safety net which over time will be simplified to a number of key minima.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">AWAs can be individual in nature and rely on the corporations power for their authority. Unincorporated businesses will be unable, because of section 51(xxxv) of the constitution, to access AWAs and I think it is doubtful that unincorporated, non-unionised workplaces will be able to access certified agreements, but that is for the future. Unincorporated businesses, as well as incorporated businesses, will also have recourse to state enterprise agreements arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where state agreements are made, media speculation of 28 May makes it clear, there is some concern that where a state agreement is entered into, the federal award will not provide any minimum pay conditions but the state award will instead apply. This is obviously an area of concern, with most state awards setting lower minima than federal awards. Such a situation does have the potential to erode pay packets and undermine this government's promise that no worker will be worse off. I hope the press speculation of an amendment to this provision does materialise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The move to an increasingly sophisticated enterprise bargaining system is being greatly assisted by the removal of the old provisions of the Industrial Relations Act 1988, which stipulated that unions must have at least 10,000 members, and by the abolition of the `conveniently belong to' rule by which unions had almost exclusive coverage rights in some industries and occupational groupings. This has opened up the new potential for large unions to undo the union amalgamation process and allow workers to establish new unions at their workplaces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unions will now be in open competition with each other. This is good for choice and has the potential to create thousands of enterprise unions which could, if they wanted, establish confederations of like&hyphen;minded enterprise unions. The only potential downside there is that many workplaces which currently have only one union may develop many unions, making it more difficult for both unions and employers to negotiate enterprise agreements. Workers' choice is, however, of overriding importance, with no union deserving exclusive coverage in a workplace as a matter of right.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2766">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another major reform proposed is that of legalising the right to strike and the right to lock out during the bargaining period for a new enterprise agreement. This apparently follows development in other countries, especially the United States; and a particular example since the Second World War is, of course, Japan. It is essential that unions and workers in general have the right to strike as the employers should have the right to lock out employees as part of the process of striking a new enterprise agreement. Hopefully, it is never used but that right and choice should be there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even in the most cooperative workplace, conflict will develop between the parties from time to time. It is up to the parties in a dispute to settle it themselves, avoiding recourse to a third party. This is part and parcel of employers and employees not being able to pass the buck to someone else, as at present they can pass it onto an arbitrator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is important for many reasons, some of which I have already mentioned, yet the reform of the unfair dismissal laws is a welcome measure which will give some hope to many unemployed in Australia. Labor's former provisions were definitely anti&hyphen;employment. They were a massive disincentive for employers to take on new staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new provisions give employees a fair and simple process of appeal against dismissal. The new system, unlike Labor's sham, is fair to both employers and employees. It will be interesting to see how this provision measures with state unfair dismissal laws, which in some cases provide wider scope for fair dismissal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Complementary to increasing the level of competition among unions is the right for workers to join or not to join trade unions. This is a fundamental right in any democratic society, which Labor has continually denied working Australians in the past&mdash;and, indeed, so have previous coalition governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a fundamental right in a democratic society, and you might ask why. We all know that Labor does not really pay attention to the rights of individual workers. Labor and the union movement are only interested in maintaining the flow of union funds into the Labor <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Party's coffers, and compulsory unionism, preference clauses and exclusive coverage provide unions with the opportunity to do just that by maximising their membership. The gravy train, hopefully, is coming to an end.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Building sites and other workplaces where `no ticket, no start' rules apply will hopefully become a thing of the past. This is especially the case for independent contractors who have been forced to join unions if they simply wanted to work as independent contractors. That is an appalling position, especially as unions not only do not represent contractors' interests but also are outwardly hostile towards them in so many cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reinclusion of sections 45D and 45E in the Trade Practices Act to reintroduce prohibitions on secondary boycotts is a welcome break from the Labor government's dilution of the secondary boycott provisions during its terms in office and the transfer of the supposed replacement provisions to the Industrial Relations Act. Labor was not able to alter the old 45D and 45E provisions because of coalition and Democrat opposition in the Senate. Unfortunately, as the Australian Democrats have continually slid to the left of much of the Labor Party, they have reneged on the early policy position of Don Chipp and the Democrats. That largely reflects the Democrats' lack of direction and, most importantly, lack of principle. They are just another populist political player.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate should give this bill serious consideration&mdash;and it should pass it. The minister has stated that he is amenable to constructive amendments but, rightly, he will not allow the bill to be carved up. It is a whole package. It is all or nothing in terms of its main provisions. This should not come as a surprise to anyone inside or outside of this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The system of compulsory arbitration has always been a system which has benefited unions and employer associations, as well as other members of the industrial relations club. Because of the IR system's focus on arbitration, managers and union officials in individual workplaces abrogated responsibility in the past for the conduct of workplace relations. In effect, the system was able to develop in an <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2767"> adversarial manner, with little regard being paid to working together because any disputes would eventually be arbitrated. Those opposing this bill will be threatening Australia's economic future and, if they do, should be condemned in the strongest possible terms. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill is the most important piece of industrial relations legislation to be debated in this House since the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill 1904 and, therefore, it is a pleasure to be able to speak in favour of it. In those early parliaments, when George Reid, Alfred Deakin and John Watson all fought for control of the treasury bench, attempts at introducing, varying, amending and repealing what became the centralised wage arbitration framework brought down each of those governments as they lost support on the floor of the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last month the member for Flinders (Mr Reith) introduced this bill. A previous member for Flinders, and a Prime Minister at that, reputedly lost his own seat&mdash;indeed, the only Prime Minister in our history to do so&mdash;when his government attempted to withdraw from the field of arbitration. Several Commonwealth governments have found their graveyard in industrial relations, so it is not surprising that they treated the industrial relations system as a sacred cow and that the arbitration system lasted as long as it did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Few would argue today that the present industrial relations system is worth dying in a ditch for&mdash;indeed, even bothering to erect barricades for. As I will state later in my speech, the elements that have led to the deconsecration of the industrial relations system are contained within. I find it rather paradoxical that those who propound the doctrine of immutability with respect to the industrial relations system, those who devote themselves to `the culture'&mdash;or is that `the cult'?&mdash;of the present arrangements, are so quick to appeal to history in this debate, as if the original drafters of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act in the first decade of federation prescribed a formula which was inerrant or infallible.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For instance, in speaking against the bill last week, the member for Barton (Mr McClelland) cited and quoted both Charles Kingston and Alfred Deakin in attempting to garner support for his case. In proposing a certain model of conciliation and arbitration, both Kingston and Deakin were responding to the need to remedy the bitterness of the industrial mayhem of the late 19th century and thereby ensure a sound, productive and peaceful environment wherein wealth would be created, assimilated and redistributed. It is also interesting to note the connection that Deakin's `new protection' sought to make between tariff protection and a strong arbitration body.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both men would never have predicted that the model they advocated would translate and transmogrify into the monster it has become. Indeed, the evolution of their original idea is a misnomer. There has been no evolution&mdash;more atavism&mdash;in creating a monolithic dinosaur, an arcane network of courts and tribunals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As early as the 1930s, E.O.G. Shann, one of Australia's greatest economists and historians, identified the intellectual bankruptcy of centralised wage arbitration by stating that Australia's greatest economic evil was distortion of the labour market, stemming from the interaction of trade union power with the regulation through arbitration of wages. It was in the 1980s that, as our terms of trade deteriorated, it became evident that the symptoms of low productivity and chronic current account deficits were related to more fundamental deficiencies in our institutions which protected our capital, goods and labour markets; that they were symptomatic of a deeper malaise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirteen years ago John Howard first articulated the need for labour market deregulation in a speech at the National Press Club. It was then that he declared:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The time has come when we have to turn Mr Justice Higgins on his head.</PARA>
<PARA>It was a time when John Howard rejected the orthodox view that Stanley Bruce had lost that election in 1929 because he had attacked arbitration; when Gerard Henderson highlighted the culture of the industrial relations <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2768"> bureaucracy&mdash;or the `IR club', as he called it&mdash;which was dedicated to the maintenance of the status quo.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most incredible things about this bill is that we are actually debating it in 1996&mdash;that is, 10 years after the need for a market based wage system became apparent to everybody who had an even remote interest in the subject. Someone whose interest was not remote in 1986 was Andrew Hay, who stated at that time:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I don't believe we have time on our side which will allow us to take an evolutionary route over a ten year period.</PARA>
<PARA>Too bad; 10 years have passed now&mdash;but better late than never.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interestingly, most other countries deregulated their labour markets first, then the financial market, and then lowered protection. In Australia meaningful industrial relations reform was something that the ALP were unable or unwilling to achieve, hamstrung as they were by the labour movement. In Australia only a Liberal government could achieve deregulation of the labour market and practical change to the culture of the workplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two of the individuals who fought the excesses of union power in the 1980s are now sitting on the government front bench. By their involvement in landmark cases, both Ian McLachlan and Peter Costello helped to highlight the need for a change in work culture in Australia. More importantly, it was the Liberal Party which led the way in arguing for reform. For Labor, this was a sacred cow they would not lead to market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even so, in 1993 Labor recognised the need to move the industrial system away from the staged adversarial system that centralised arbitration had encouraged; that bargaining at the workplace level was more likely to bring about sustained productivity which would therefore underline real wage increases; that, in effect, the best way to improve the productive performance of individuals and enterprises was to place the emphasis on bargaining at an individual level&mdash;consultation, not a sham and destructive confrontation.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's system of industrial relations was always unique. The only country that had a similar framework of central wage fixing and tribunals was New Zealand. It is now five years since New Zealand passed the Employment Contracts Act and gave up on a paternalistic system which encouraged divisive collective bargaining.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This gives us an opportunity to see how Australia might benefit from workplace reform. As Judith Sloan has said, in that period inflation has remained low, industrial disputes are the lowest they have ever been, there has been a 14 per cent growth in employment and unemployment has fallen from 11 per cent to six per cent. In fact, unemployment has fallen more rapidly amongst Maoris than amongst non&hyphen;Maoris, and the distribution of income has become more equal. More importantly, a recent survey has shown that three&hyphen;quarters of New Zealanders are happy with their working terms and conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As in Australia, those New Zealand reforms were opposed by the Labour Party and the union movement. As in Australia, only a non&hyphen;Labour government could implement the labour market deregulation. As in Australia, the New Zealand National Party was rewarded in 1990 with a solid majority to implement economic reform which had stalled under Labour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia and New Zealand emerged from the recession at the same time, but in New Zealand jobs growth has been quicker and unemployment has been reduced more rapidly. In New Zealand industrial unrest was predicted. Five years later, the country has experienced one of the biggest falls in working days lost in the OECD. Maori and Pacific Islanders were predicted to be disadvantaged. Unemployment has fallen most rapidly among this group. Exploitation by employers was predicted and a complaints hotline was set up. That was discontinued for lack of interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At an enterprise level, good outcomes have not been guaranteed for businesses or employees. Just as in the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill, bad management and bad unions are likely to fall by the wayside. A new culture of management has been required, but the national <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2769"> statistics from New Zealand point to an improvement in productivity and job opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The world competitiveness reports now rate New Zealand among the top 11, while Australia slips back from 16th to 21st. In a competitive world, Australia cannot carry an industrial relations system which was crafted in response to conditions existing at Federation. A rigid labour market has contributed to high unemployment, large current account deficits, real wage decline, patchy productivity growth and levels of industrial disputation which are higher than our competitors'. After 18 quarters of economic growth the lowest unemployment figure the previous government could boast was still above eight per cent. More importantly, youth unemployment, at just under 30 per cent, is a national disgrace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The system contained an assumption that employees and employers were unable to advance their own interests and required unions and the legalistic apparatus of industrial tribunals. Conflict was entrenched and contrived while our competitors developed cooperative workplace relations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this bill, the award system will remain to provide a safety net of minimum wages and conditions. The IRC will be unable to rule on claims above the safety net. Its role will be to set the awards and see that they are abided by. However, for most employees the focus will move to responsibility for individual initiative for the agreements made at an enterprise and workplace level. The bill recognises the mutual interest that employers and employees have in the success and productivity of their workplace and allows them to make decisions over wages and conditions for themselves if they wish.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> While discrimination will be avoided, the flexibility of the new agreements will allow employees to balance their work and family life. Surely this is what we should all be working towards. And surely this is what the proposed section 170 is attempting to do in facilitating agreements to be reached at the workplace. Personal and collective experience clearly demonstrates that it is those who are involved on a day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day basis in the work ings of an office or a site who know what are fair and reasonable working conditions, what suits and what enables them to have a life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There can be no doubt that, as it has always been, a person is largely defined in society by the work that he or she engages in. Whilst there is a large body of people who enjoy their daily work&mdash;and here I am mainly referring to paid work, as that is the type of work with which this bill is concerned&mdash;most people I know would say that they work to live, not live to work. In other words, these people have lives and interests outside the time they spend in the office or on the site. The beauty of this Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill is that it will deliver the flexibility that most working people desire. This flexibility will be allied with a compliance system that gives no&hyphen;one unjust privileges over the rest of the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, let me make this next point strongly: this bill is not about protecting unscrupulous or incompetent employers; this bill is not anti&hyphen;union. Indeed, if concepts such as flexibility and efficiency are to be considered anti&hyphen;union, there is no hope for any of us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Liberal Party is not in the business of bashing unions. The Liberal Party has always been about choice. It is an obvious but important point to make that the coalition are about promoting the fundamental freedom of association as well as the fundamental freedom of non&hyphen;association. In the same way that no&hyphen;one is compelled to join a union, no&hyphen;one under this bill is denied union membership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the creative union leader or organiser, this bill affords exciting opportunities to reinvigorate a movement which is in decline. Indeed, the more I examine the bill the more I am convinced that there exists a historic opportunity for unions to rethink their current strategy and to flourish in the next century. As stated before, a genuine and responsible union need not fear any provision in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unions that are responsible and accountable to their members will have a valuable place in the new system and their role will change. Both Peter Sams of the New South Wales Labor Council and Doug Cameron of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2770"> Australian Manufacturers Workers Union, while not endorsing the bill, have seen the opportunities that this legislation presents to arrest the decline in union membership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is little wonder why the union movement as a whole is in decline. The protection granted to the union movement has seen it become lazy and weak. The lack of competition within the union movement has exacerbated its decline. Rather than participate in a reawakening, the ACTU has decided to continue the wake.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A policy we have long held is to allow greater competition between unions in so far as regards representational rights. It is for this reason that I support the bill's abolition of what has been termed the `conveniently belong' requirement. In an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> on 27 April this year, Alan Kohler neatly summarised the current situation and the reason for this proposal, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For too long unions have been given monopoly rights to represent workers. Like all anti-competitive practices, it has ultimately worked against unions:&mdash;traditionally Australian workers have had the choice of either joining the union they are given&mdash;or not joining one at all. More and more are choosing the latter. The conveniently-belong rule simply says that an existing union can't broaden its reach to cover a new set of workers, and a new union can't be formed in a workplace, if there is an existing union to which the workers might conveniently belong already. At present, completing the anti-competitive picture is Section 118A of the current IR Act, which gives the IRC power to resolve disputes by awarding the right to represent a group of workers to one union, and denying it all others.</PARA>
<PARA>The reasoning behind the implementation of the `conveniently belong' rule was to avoid demarcation disputes. Unfortunately, the result of the rule has been one of union atrophy with this bill. If businesses are suffering from demarcation disputes, under this bill the IRC would have the power to reallocate union coverage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot help reflecting on the irony associated with the coalition introducing legislation which will encourage and enable unions to be more responsive to their members' interests. In providing for choice in representation, the smart union organisers who focus at the enterprise level will be extremely effective and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> successful in articulating and promoting the interests of their members. There can be no doubt that the former government's encouragement of the formation of mega&hyphen;unions has contributed to the decline of the union movement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The aims of this bill are many and admirable. In the time remaining in my speech, I would like to comment on just a few. The bill encourages the development of a cooperative approach between state and federal jurisdictions. For instance, section 152 will provide that federal awards will no longer automatically override state employment agreements&mdash;that is, state enterprise agreements and voluntary employment agreements will no longer be overridden by subsequent Commonwealth awards. I must say in passing that without such a reform the entire nature of federalism is undermined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Several members have raised the issue of the gender difference in over-award payments. They have ignored that over-award payments are set on market and not discriminatory grounds. Over-award payments which are discriminatory on the grounds of gender are prohibited by the Sex Discrimination Act of 1984. Cases of sexual discrimination will be able to apply to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's unfair dismissal law was a classic demonstration of good intention shrouded in bad law. The unfair dismissal law resulted in a brake on employment and frustrated small businesses who were working towards providing real jobs. We will replace the failed unfair Brereton law with a procedure which provides employees with an efficient and effective avenue for legitimate claims. The Industrial Relations Commission will have the power to settle claims and order compensation where appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I strongly support the reintroduction of the secondary boycott provisions&mdash;sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act. These sections give employers, particularly small business employers, legal redress and remove any privileged position that unions may have enjoyed before the law. Australia no longer has the capacity to indulge protected and privileged bodies. Perhaps there was a time <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2771"> when we could afford the preferential treatment that the union movement has received in this country, but such a time does not exist now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As members of this House will know, John Howard, as Minister for Small Business, originally introduced the first of these sections in 1977. Without them, the employers and employees would have been powerless against the live sheep export dispute of 1978 and the illegal strike of the Australian Meat Industry Employees Union at Mudginberri in 1986. The importance of sections 45D and 45E is not so much how often they are used but that they act as deterrents to militant and unlawful strike action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also support the provisions which remove the privilege that unions enjoy of exemption for civil liability under state law and delays to common law actions. It is a fundamental principle that all associations and all individuals should be treated as equal before the law. State law was the key to ending the Queensland power dispute and the extreme strike action of the ETU, and common law action was successful in giving Dollar Sweets redress against the militant action of the tomato&hyphen;left Federated Confectioners Association. This is not union bashing; this is union liberating. The compliance regulations simply ensure that all associations, and that includes unions, are treated equally before the law. I commend this bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this place to support the amendments moved by the member for Canberra (Mr McMullan). Anybody who has been paying attention to this debate will by now have understood that, rather than this legislation being an advance in industrial relations, it is a retrograde step.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In listening to the speeches and reading through the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of what those opposite have been saying, one gets the feeling of being in some kind of time warp. The rhetoric and attitudes and the material coming across date back 20, 30 and 40 years. I wonder where these people have been for the last 10 or 15 years when we have seen such substantial changes taking place in our work force and our work relations.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More importantly than that, the underpinning of this legislation is, in itself, fraudulent. All through the election campaign we were hearing about unfair dismissals. We now realise that was exaggerated. We all know that the cases referred to were in fact either state cases or, in the main, cases dealt with prior to amendment. So the idea of working up some kind of public animosity towards industrial legislation based on that was fraudulent. The idea that somehow unions were the problem, when in fact they were very much part of the solution and have been for very many years, was fraudulent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the amendment bill points out in its very first clause, this legislation breaches the rock solid guarantee given by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), who is so pious about his reputation, that no&hyphen;one would be worse off. Not many speakers have referred to it, but the previous speaker mentioned the transference of people back into state jurisdiction, which will make many of them much worse off. As to the changes to apprenticeships, on the one hand the government talks about shifting money from long&hyphen;term unemployed support to supporting apprentices and on the other hand is saying that in future years apprentices will only be paid for the four days a week that they are at work. It might not affect existing apprentices, but the fact is that this legislation means that in the years ahead people who become an apprentice boilermaker, metalworker or electrician will only be paid on a pro rata basis while they are at work. In fact, their wages will be less than they are now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the one hand they are saying that they want to encourage more apprenticeships, but on the other hand they are signalling in this legislation that there will be a cut in wages for those people. Workplace based training is a fuzzy area and it means that effectively people will be working for $3.05 per hour. So much for rock solid guarantees, so much for the basis of it and so much for the mandate. The government has no mandate for what is being put forward in this legislation. In fact, to the contrary, the government's mandate was to protect people, not to attack them. The government's mandate was to improve the economy, not push it backwards.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2772">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer back to the early 1980s, when the current Prime Minister was then the Treasurer. There was a massive wage increase of 14&half; per cent in 1981. I want to refer to what it did to the economy, to workplaces and to people individually. In Newcastle the steel works was virtually closed. In 1983 the steel works was closing, make no mistake. In 1983 one of the first things that the previous government did was to establish a steel plan. One of its key components was to require the company and the work force to work together. In fact, that was quite an exciting experience because it had not happened much before. A number of people in BHP management said to us, `That has been really effective. We are glad that happened.' It was the first time they had actually sat down and worked it out. They told their employees about their business and what was happening inside the business. They told them the real figures and showed them the cost inputs, the market prices and all the other forces at work which drive a business. The employees had never known this before. The employers told them all of that and received enormous cooperation. Now BHP has invested heavily in the plant and it is committed to investing even more heavily in it in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, there has been a reduction in the work force, which has been quite difficult for my community. However, it has resulted in enormous productivity and a massive improvement in steel quality. Let us face it, BHP Newcastle produced poor quality steel from its inception until the late 1980s because it did not need to produce good steel. Part of this whole process has involved looking at quality, performance and productivity across the business with the work force being involved in it as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> What is proposed in the legislation would mean that BHP would deal with every employee separately. Under the CRA model&mdash;as is allowed by this process&mdash;every employee will have a private contract and would be told, `You can't tell anybody else how much you are getting and, if you do, you could be dismissed for it.' If we had done that in 1983, that company would have gone by now. There is no way it would have survived in New castle in that kind of environment of worker against worker, section against section and mischief against mischief. That is what this is about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is more than going back to the old days of industrial warfare. That was a `them and us' attitude when there were bosses and workers. That was the old model, which has long gone. This legislation puts everybody against everybody. This is not team building; this is team destroying. For example, Incitec is a company involved in a very difficult industry and is reliant upon natural gas. In Newcastle natural gas is three to four times the price of the same raw material in Indonesia. Ninety per cent of that company's costs come from its raw materials. I will not go into the profits made by AGL and the problems of gas pipelines. That is not about employees or workers; this is more about the wisdom of some of our decision makers in business. Incitec's gas supplies cost them three to four times the price. They went to their employees and said, `We really need to minimise our wages costs as best we can.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1991 Incitec, in conjunction with the government, took people across to Canada and America to look at a range of companies. They wanted the unions to be involved because they thought it was important to have that corporate knowledge available. Those funds were provided to assist union representatives to go on that delegation&mdash;to enormous criticism from those opposite. It became a matter of criticism in the parliament that that was actually being done. These are the people who talk about cooperation. As a result of that visit, that company has dramatically changed its internal structures and relationships. The shifts, hours and days that they work were designed by the work force in conjunction with management and the unions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1992 I took enormous pleasure in attending a seminar sponsored by the Commonwealth. Two union representatives attended the seminar and were the first speakers. They outlined the benefits of restructuring and how to do it, as per the Incitec model. They talked about annualised salaries, 10&hyphen;hour shifts and a whole range of ways to do things differently. Those people, Mark Soper and Mary <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2773"> McGill, have done an enormous amount. They have gone into workplaces and talked to managers and owners of plants in Newcastle and throughout the whole Hunter Valley. They have advocated new ideas and new methods. The Commonwealth's investment in those people travelling to Canada has paid enormous dividends for companies right throughout the valley.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In recent months, Incitec have shown record performances of output of both productivity and quality. Their up&hyphen;time in terms of their plant has improved enormously and their whole relationship with their work force has grown wonderfully. This started five years ago in that particular company. It started in BHP Newcastle back in 1983-84. Where have these people been for all these years? Don't they know what is doing on in the real world? All this rhetoric we are hearing about really dates back a very long time, to a past age.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that Australia needs to be competitive and flexible, but Australia needs to work as a team. It needs to have people working and sharing responsibility, and taking responsibility. The idea that somehow those employers at Incitec could have individually negotiated a massive change in working hours and work conditions across different trades, occupations and backgrounds is absolutely laughable. They would have closed years ago with this legislation, this kind of model and the projections put forward, as would BHP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am fortunate to have a copy of a submission that Dr Roy Green made to the Senate inquiry. Dr Green is well known and incredibly well respected in the industrial relations system and in the system called better practice. Just last week we heard about the National Audit Commission's report. We constantly see the new government picking up from the previous government on the term `best practice'. It is now an important signal. What has been put forward in Newcastle, which has been working so well, is the acceptance of the concept of best practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Best practice is not simply about separating unions out and working with individual employees. It is about how the whole company functions as a team. The models that are available are now established and well en trenched. We have companies in Newcastle such as Goninan's and Anderson Rae increasing their work forces and winning contracts against competition both nationally and internationally. They do not need this legislation to achieve that; they just need a bit of commonsense, a cooperative workplace environment and a cooperative union environment where the union becomes the reservoir of support and understanding and depth of knowledge, not the image being put forward. Dr Green's submission states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, a body of research demonstrates that awards are not the main or even a significant factor impeding flexibility and productivity in Australian workplaces.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a person with incredible experience and depth of knowledge saying that the idea somehow that awards are stopping flexibility is just not true. It is not true because in Newcastle we know it is not true. We have proven it is not true. The old industrial centre of Newcastle has modernised and changed like nowhere in the world, and faster than anywhere in the world. If one compares Newcastle with Birmingham, Dusseldorf or Pittsburgh and looks at what has occurred and how long it took to make the changes, they will find that Newcastle changed faster than anywhere in the world. What has been put forward today in this legislation undermines all of that. This is terrifying stuff to a place like Newcastle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> quoted Peter Barrack, the Secretary of the Newcastle Trades Hall Council. He has been one of the drivers of these changes, as have so many others. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think the legislation is ideologically driven. And I think there is a lack of understanding of the sort of co-operation through the best practices process that is happening on the job.</PARA>
<PARA>We are using best practice procedures in Newcastle. Someone should tell these people opposite. They should get out there now. I think the last speaker mentioned John Howard's legislation in 1977. That is about where they are. They are still fighting the battle of 1981. Remember when Malcolm went to the wedding. To get to the wedding he had to agree to a wage increase. They are still fighting that battle 15 years later.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2774">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is all rooted in that kind of class warfare. There obviously is a class warfare in Australia, but it is not from us; it is from those opposite. Just go and read their speeches and look at what they are saying. The hatred and the venom that comes across to the union movement is unbelievable. Obviously, they do not know anything about it. Obviously, they do not realise that in a sensible industrial city or country the unions are part of the solution. They are not the problem; they are part of the solution. The best practice model has been demonstrated and proven to be a vehicle to harness the experience and the depth, to build teams and to build a team across a company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has gone on with this whole legislation is a farce. A whole lot of political rhetoric has come forward in the guise of economic reform. The fact is that this legislation is aimed at driving down wages. That is what it is about. It is aimed at going back to the old system of driving down wages to somehow improve economic performance. If this legislation were adopted as it is now, there is no doubt that average wages in Australia would reduce. Casualisation would increase and youth exploitation would worsen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am increasingly getting reports&mdash;in fact, I commented publicly about it not long ago&mdash;about the number of young people being exploited. They are working for nothing to get work experience and working at weekends and not being paid overtime. They are too scared to tell anybody because they need the job. These people are being taught at 14 and 15 not to trust employers because they will get used up and not to tell anybody because if they do they will be blacked around the town. What is happening out there now is partly being encouraged by this legislative process. As for the idea of a 15-year-old going to an employment advocate, it is hard to get them to approach a politician or even tell their parents or their friends, let alone some government official. This legislation is setting a climate for division, for disloyalty and eventually for driving down wages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I came to the chamber to support the amendment. I encourage the community of Australia to engage in this debate via the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Senate inquiry. This legislation cannot be allowed to pass in the form that it is. If it does, it will be a massive backwards step&mdash;not to the 1980s but to the 1960s and 1970s.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 is one of the most significant pieces of legislation to be debated in this House. It signifies a new beginning for the Australian workplace; indeed, it is an opportunity we cannot afford to miss.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill marks a substantial change. It recognises that high rates of unemployment and Australia's increasing exposure to international competition mean there is little time to waste in changing the mind-set of Australian workplace culture. This bill will shift the underlying rationale for a system from an increasingly outdated and paternalistic model to one which treats employers and employees as intelligent individuals, capable of determining their own best interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition has led the debate for reform in our industrial relations system. Indeed, I congratulate the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), who has championed the need to make major changes so as to enable Australia to become productive, efficient and successful again. The Prime Minister's leadership stands in stark contrast to the leadership of former Prime Ministers Hawke and Keating, who buckled, in my opinion, under the pressure from the ACTU on issues of industrial reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will provide Australian workers with new opportunities. They will enjoy greater flexibility, higher living standards and better paid jobs. To achieve this, it is necessary to replace the system inherited from the previous government. This is not because the model that they had does not provide the legal means for reaching enterprise agreements but because the old system treats genuine workplace agreements as a second-best option.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are breaking with the past here, where people are forced against their own free will to join a union dominated by a few heavies who put their own selfish interests ahead of those whom they are supposed to represent. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2775"> I suggest that it is time to break from that. Those on the Labor side of politics see adversity and conflict in all relationships between employers and employees. Members opposite would have us believe that all employees are not capable of understanding their own interests or how to best protect them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members on the opposite side of this House say they do not see the need for reform. After their 13 years in power, they are blind to the situation which they have left this nation in&mdash;around a million people unemployed, many hundreds of thousands more underemployed, ballooning current account deficits and foreign debt, stagnant wages, record high interest rates, and a growing gap between the rich and the poor. Our ability to compete internationally is sadly deficient&mdash;not to mention Mr Beazley's $8 billion black hole. Yet the members opposite have the nerve to ask: why reform?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's accord system, which was supposed to help Australian workers, has stifled them. That system helped a long-term decline in workers' living standards compared with other nations and gave us, this nation, a record level of unemployment. So much for a party which purports to represent the workers!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under this legislation, employees will not be left out in the cold to fend for themselves against those employers who may seek to exploit them. The Employment Advocate will provide assistance to employees and employers about their rights and obligations. A principal deficiency in the current system is that it requires of employers and employees a degree of familiarity with legal and procedural niceties. Small business people in particular cannot be expected to have such detailed technical knowledge, nor can most afford the services of those who do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Employment Advocate will provide a free grievance investigation service, will handle alleged breaches of Australian workplace agreements, will deal with any complaints of duress in reaching an agreement and will deal with freedom of association grievances. The Employment Advocate will pay particular attention to providing support for young people, women and people from non- <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> English speaking backgrounds. At present, of course, it may be theoretically possible for employers and employees to negotiate mutually advantageous agreements. But they are disinclined to do so because of the many obstacles they must overcome before an agreement can be formally sanctioned by an industrial tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was a small business operator, and I know that the best assets in one's business are the people who work in it. Employers cannot succeed without them, and employees have nowhere to go without employers. We need each other. We need to work together for mutual benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am proud of the fact that many years ago the people working in my factory were able to negotiate an agreement whereby everyone benefited. They chose the hours and shifts they wanted to work. They negotiated an over-award payment for themselves. They negotiated a share in the company's profits, which in turn provided an incentive for increased productivity and best work practices. They were prepared to participate in such an arrangement because they understood that, by increasing the efficiency and productivity of the company, not only would they benefit themselves but this would also provide jobs for their mates who did not have one. The point I am trying to make here is that all of these arrangements were entered into without union involvement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The small business community had two main and very real problems with the previous Labor government: bureaucratic red tape and the unfair dismissal law. I will address the issue of red tape and unnecessary bureaucracy at another time, and I would like to congratulate the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser) for his speedy work in addressing this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The unfair dismissal laws of the member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton) have turned out to be a disaster for this country. That legislation has proved to be the biggest disincentive for employing people. Labor's unfair dismissal provisions are complex and confusing. Under them, employers cannot sack someone who continually lies to them or steals from them.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2776">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed new laws will provide a fair go for all. They will be fair to both the employee and the employer. They will provide employees with access to a simpler process of challenging dismissals. They will protect the rights of employees who have been unfairly dismissed. They will discourage frivolous and malicious claims, and they will empower the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to consider whether a termination of employment was harsh, unjust or unreasonable. This bill will give business&mdash;small, medium and large&mdash;the boost it needs to start employing people again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members opposite argue strongly for the unions. I have no problems with that at all, but I have a real problem when they say that we on this side of the House are anti-union. We are not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since being elected as the member for Canning, I have lost count of the number of people who have visited or phoned me because they were having problems in their workplaces. I always ask them whether they have spoken with their union. `Yes,' they say, `but they'&mdash;meaning the union&mdash;`were not interested. They didn't want to know about me,' they say. What a great advertisement for unions. And members opposite cannot understand why union membership has dropped dramatically over the last decade or so. I can tell them categorically that it is because the unions are not servicing the members they are supposed to represent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today, many workers are disillusioned with unions and ask why they should pay their union dues. Union bosses are certainly not helping their members. They are more likely to be playing factional politics with members opposite at the expense of the workers. I believe that unions must now be seen as a service provider for their members and not players in their own right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The abolition of compulsory unionism will guarantee workers genuine freedom of association. This government is committed to giving people a choice. Workers should have the right, and will have the right under this legislation, to have a far greater choice of which union or employer organisation can best represent them.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Workers who believe that their union is not representing them, and there are many who believe this to be true, can vote to establish their own union called an autonomous enterprise branch. They will need only a minimum of 20 members, rather than the present 100 members, to be registered. This truly gives the Australian worker a chance to say who shall represent him or her and this will better cater for the problems that arise within their individual and unique workplaces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill before the House recognises that the role of the tribunal needs to be more facilitative and less prescriptive. When solutions are imposed by outside bodies, not only do they invariably fail to give sufficient weight to purely local factors, they also do not become the property of the parties themselves and, as anyone with practical experience in this area knows, where the parties are not fully committed to a bargain there is little chance of operating it effectively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This workplace relations bill will benefit women. Under the new legislation, restrictions will be lifted on permanent part&hyphen;time work. This will particularly help women returning to the work force after a break in their careers. Family&hyphen;friendly working arrangements between employees and their employers will be possible under this new legislation. Most women do not fit into the standard mould of working five days a week from nine to five. Indeed, they need flexibility to combine their work with their family responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that the present arrangements have perpetuated a lack of flexibility in relation to the employment of part-time and casual workers. Many awards are overly prescriptive about how such forms of employment are to operate. Current arrangements which set employment quotas for part&hyphen;time workers or prescribe minimum hours of work often hurt those whom they are designed to help most.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under Labor's award system it is hard for people, particularly women, to get any sort of permanent part&hyphen;time work. Casual employment is the only real option yet the uncertainty of this is not realistic. By lifting the restriction on regular part&hyphen;time work this bill will increase the opportunities for people to work <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2777"> part&hyphen;time with set conditions such as sick leave.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, personal and carers leave and parental leave will be guaranteed. Dismissal based on discriminatory grounds such as pregnancy will continue to be unlawful. Pay discrimination on the basis of sex will not be allowed in awards or agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To sum this up, the safety net remains in place. Awards, fair minimum wages and conditions for all employees will continue. Viewed in its historical context, this bill consolidates the gains made by federal workers under the award system by preserving existing benefits as legislated minima or award based rights. It is not an attack on community standards or basic rights. What the bill does is recognise the practical distinction between broadly based community standards and requirements and the need in a competitive economy for workers and employers to establish working arrangements which meet the demands of the individual workplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will promote genuine cooperation between employees and their employers. It will give Australians greater choice and more incentive, and that is what we on this side of the House are all about.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a very important piece of legislation which will dramatically affect the course of workplace relations in this country if it is passed without amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at the history of workplaces and industrial relations, you will see that we had a situation a century or two back where workers were exploited in an extreme fashion. We even had child labour. You had people being sacked for undertaking any kind of industrial action and you had very poor wages and conditions. They were part of the fabric of poverty and of disadvantage in communities in their early stages of industrialisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Workers banded together and formed trade unions or combinations because they found that that was the only way they could gain decent wages and conditions for themselves and for their families. They further found that when there was industrial disputation governments would intervene on the side of employ ers. So in Australia, for example, they entered the political process and formed their own political party, the Labor Party, which still stands, over 100 years later, and still stands more for a fair go for employees than for any other single thing. No matter how much our society changes over the years, and no matter how much the political agenda might change over the years, the thing which the Australian Labor Party will always stand for, come hell or high water, is a fair go for employees, irrespective of circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are the circumstances that we find ourselves in now? I suppose the internationalisation of economic life is the most important feature of the times that we live in. That internationalisation of economies is putting stress on employees which, in a way, is not unlike that which they faced back in the 19th century when trade unions and the Australian Labor Party were formed in the first place. Workers are told that if they do not produce more or accept poorer wages or working conditions, then the product they are making will be manufactured in some other country and they will lose their jobs. The employer can go elsewhere, just as the employer said to employees 100 years or so ago, `I can go elsewhere; I can get somebody to work for less.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have theorists and academics writing about technology and leisure time and asking the question, `What are we going to do with all the leisure time that we are going to get out of new technology?' Yet the opposite seems to be the case. Recently there was a talkback show about the Queen's Birthday holiday and whether we were having too many holidays. Just about everybody who rang in said, `I was working on the Queen's Birthday.' I did the same thing; I went into my office to work on the in&hyphen;tray which had built up. That is a feature of modern life; we are working more rather than less. So these international pressures are on us. But the question is: does this bill represent the way to go? In my submission, the answer to that is clearly no.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an odd schizophrenia developing about the government's position on wages. We hear some government ministers or <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2778"> spokespersons talking about labour market `costs'. This is the old language of the right of politics; wages are considered a `cost' to business and a `cost' to employers. I have heard the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) use that expression in the House about labour costs on the waterfront and in other places. We have also had the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) talking about real wages and saying that Labor was responsible for a decline in real wages. They will have to work out just what their position is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What you need to understand about `real wages' is that it is a question not simply of wages but also of incomes and other factors which go to make up the living conditions of ordinary Australians. Under the accord, we had not only agreements about wage outcomes but also efforts in the area of job creation, reforms in superannuation, Medicare, family allowance supplements, and so on. Real living standards rose for ordinary Australians during the period of the Hawke and Keating governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also note that the Minister for Industrial Relations has claimed that real incomes in Victoria have been increasing since the advent of the Kennett government. The question in my mind is: whose income? Mr Ron Walker appears on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> rich list and, back in May 1994, had $80 million. In May this year, he was listed as having $190 million. He has made $110 million in two years, so his income has gone up. He can, indeed, offer the Minister for Industrial Relations a discount of $43,000 on the purchase of a townhouse in St Kilda Road. So some people's incomes are increasing. But whether ordinary Victorians are having their incomes increase is far more questionable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For Victorians, the question is whether this bill is going to make them better off or worse off. Taking shop assistants as an example, after the advent of the Kennett government Westco Jeans introduced employment contracts. They abandoned penalty rates and the like. They would have cost workers some $50 per week. This move by Westco Jeans was defeated through the shop assistants union moving to federal award coverage. That, of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> course, was made possible by Paul Keating's win in 1993. Now, given the change of government, that is under threat, and those workers again stand to lose that $50 per week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are three provisions in this bill which I particularly want to talk about, because I think they are extremely serious in terms of their impact on workers. The first is the question of state agreements overriding federal awards. Under schedule 5, which concerns awards, section 128 and subsections 152(2) and 152(3), the bill provides that a state enterprise agreement overrides a federal award, whether the agreement is made before or after the award.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have to bear in mind the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) gave a `rock solid guarantee'&mdash;his words&mdash;that no one would be worse off under this bill. Those employees of Westco Jeans now stand to lose the $50 per week which Kennett would have taken from them and which Paul Keating's election win saved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Giving priority to state employment contracts over federal awards reverses some 90 years of history in this country. It is the reverse of sensible industrial relations. It breathes new life into those unfortunate employment contracts developed under Jeff Kennett. It makes a mockery of the federal government's commitment to 20 minimum conditions; in the Victorian standard, you only have five conditions, so the 20 conditions disappear out the window. It makes a mockery of the guarantee by the Prime Minister that no worker will be worse off. It makes a mockery of the idea of complementary legislation, because it allows any state agreement to override the Commonwealth legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the bill will establish is a hierarchy, with Australian workplace agreements at the apex, then state employment agreements, then federal awards at the bottom of the hierarchy. That will encourage forum shopping by employers seeking to get the lowest possible outcomes. So, in Victoria and Western Australia, employers will be looking for the Kennett or Court employment contracts. Lest anyone thinks this is a bill from a government committed to states rights, that is not the case <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2779"> at all. You can use the Australian workplace agreements in New South Wales to avoid Bob Carr's protections for employees there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second area that I want to spend some time on concerns part&hyphen;time work and the abandonment of the restrictions on part&hyphen;time work. I believe this could result in major changes to the character of the workplace in this country and will have a very adverse effect on the quality of life for workers in a whole variety of industries. In the minister's speech, quite incredibly he implied that the removal of restrictions through the commission's fixing minimum and maximum hours of part&hyphen;time work would lead to `reasonable predictability' in the manner in which hours are worked, and also that removing restrictions on minimum and maximum hours of part&hyphen;time work would be a boon for workers who have family responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fairies at the bottom of the minister's garden might think that, but anyone who has got family responsibilities will know that the reality is completely the opposite. Workers with family responsibilities need to have predictability in the hours which they are to work as a part&hyphen;time worker. You can only get that predictability with awards from the commission setting minimum and maximum hours and clear rostering provisions to require employers to specifically identify the hours each week that an employee will work. In the absence of minimum and maximum hours for part&hyphen;time workers and rostering arrangements, there cannot be and there will not be any predictability given to part&hyphen;time employees concerning the hours they are to work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This will lead to the gradual but inevitable undermining of all existing agreements with minimums and maximums and rosters, so that in the very near future the Australian industrial landscape will be characterised by no predictability in any employee's hours of work. We have a situation where many people have full&hyphen;time jobs or are offered full&hyphen;time jobs, but there will be no incentive for employers to offer you full&hyphen;time work. They will be able to take you on as a part&hyphen;time worker and simply work you for as many hours as they see fit. And they might work you for effectively full&hyphen;time hours for a long period <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of time but, as soon as it suits them to do something different, you will be on part&hyphen;time work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To give an example of how this might affect a worker, you can have a worker who rings in and reports that they have had an accident. A woman, for example, works for a company for five years, regularly works 38 hours each week and accumulates sick leave of 18 days. She is out picnicking with the family and breaks her arm. Her doctor says, `You are off work for three weeks.' She rings the employer and says, `I have had an accident on the weekend and the doctor has put me off work for three weeks.' The employer says, `Well, I am very sorry to hear that. You just take care of yourself and don't rush back.' Then he says, `By the way, I was waiting for you to come in today because I had decided that we needed to cut back your hours for a while. We only needed you for four hours today and not at all for the next three weeks.' She says, `What about my sick leave?' He says, `That is terrible. It is a coincidence.' So she would get her sick leave for the four hours but not for the three weeks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In those circumstances, part&hyphen;time employment will become the order of the day, and it will disadvantage people who previously had full&hyphen;time jobs. Indeed, it will take over casual employment, where people get loadings in lieu of sick leave and the like. Those casual loadings will disappear and people will simply be taken on as part&hyphen;time employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing about which I want to express concern in the House today is the provisions concerning right of entry. Liberal Party policy was silent concerning this issue of right of entry. The government comes in here and says it has got a mandate for these changes, but during the election campaign it was absolutely silent on the issue of right of entry. The schedule concerning awards repeals the provision which gives the commission any power to make awards and orders dealing with union right of entry. Right of entry provisions are absolutely critical to providing such protections as workers will continue to have under this legislation and absolutely critical to ensuring that those protections are monitored. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2780">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is evident that the change in right of entry provisions is simply a step by the government to neutralise the effectiveness of trade unions. Its impact will be that awards will not be enforced because the alternative measures proposed will simply not be effective and workers will not be able to have their conditions enforced. For example, the existing section 286 ensures that a union official may only enter premises for the purposes of ensuring observance of an award. There is not a blank right of entry for union officials to enter employers' premises for general union business. It is only about securing the observance of awards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government were concerned with award provisions that significantly increased the statutory right of entry then they could legislate to prevent awards having provisions inconsistent with the provisions of section 286. However, what the government has done is to take away union rights of entry and not put in place any alternative system of policing the observance of awards. Policing the observance of an award can only be undertaken by an employee specifically alleging an underpayment or breach of an award and by then having the matter dealt with by a court of competent jurisdiction, and we all know how difficult it is to get matters before courts. You have to be able to get the evidence before you can get to court. Therefore, you need that right of entry. However, the government's legislation is designed to prevent unions from exercising that right of entry. An alternative method is for the employee to go through the union.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has provided in this legislation for inspectors to be appointed by the minister but it is absolutely clear in the current budgetary climate that the ability of a minister to appoint inspectors, even if the minister wanted to, is severely limited. The impact of this is that employers will have no fear of being caught out. There will be no incentive for them to obey the law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The analogy is with red&hyphen;light cameras. At intersections where a red&hyphen;light camera is installed, motorists will obey the traffic signals whether or not the red&hyphen;light camera is active and operating. It is the realistic fear of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> being caught which ensures that road traffic signals are obeyed. At intersections where there is no red&hyphen;light camera, some drivers will take the opportunity of running the red light. This is a matter of great concern to me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister promised to govern for all of us, not just for some of us, but this is a bill for some of us. This is not a bill for trade unionists who will lose important rights which they have previously had protected. This is not a bill for young people who will be exploited. There are provisions in this bill which will enable youth wages to be slashed to $3.05 per hour by an abuse of the provisions concerning time spent on the job compared with time spent on training. This is not a bill for people like shop assistants and retail employees who will be forced to work on weekends and at night with no provision for penalty rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not a bill for female workers who will suffer due to the disruption to their family life and lifestyle. Women will also suffer as a result of losing award coverage because evidence has shown that women tend to receive a lesser percentage of overaward payments than men, whereas their award wages are far more comparable with those of men.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not a bill for those without industrial muscle, the people for whom Labor's accord did so much. This is not even a bill for responsible employers whose standards will inevitably be lowered. This is a bill for the few, for a small band of employers, particularly the less scrupulous ones, and it is a bill for the most militant workers who have the industrial muscle to extract more from the industrial jungle. It will be a free&hyphen;for&hyphen;all. This bill is designed for a dog-eat-dog society. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The House will recall that in particular I said in answer to a question that not one minister, be he a foreign minister or an economic development minister, has expressed any concern to me about the abolition of the DIFF program&mdash;not one. I made these remarks in the heat of question time and in good faith and with absolutely no intention whatsoever to mislead the House. The statement I made was wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 20 June, the First Assistant Secretary of the North Asia Division of my department drew my attention to the fact that I had received a letter from a Chinese vice minister, Sun Zhenyu, concerning the abolition of the DIFF program. I asked the first assistant secretary what the status of a vice minister was. On being told it was the equivalent of a departmental secretary, I decided in my statement that I had not misled the parliament as the letter had been signed by the vice minister. I have subsequently been advised by other officers in my department that a vice minister is actually the equivalent of a deputy secretary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the Thursday night I travelled to Adelaide and from the Friday until the Sunday afternoon I was occupied with the management of the withdrawal of Miles Kupa as the nominated ambassador to Jakarta and the handling of the Sherman report. On Friday, 21 June, AusAID passed to my Canberra office a record of a conversation I had had with Professor Ginandjar on 16 April. On Monday morning AusAID faxed to my office the record of conversation with Dr Habibie.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because the parliament was not sitting until the following Monday and because of my preoccupation with the Sherman and Kupa issues, my office first alerted me to the existence of DIFF material on Sunday night. Late on the Sunday evening my advisers discussed with me the government's response to the Sherman inquiry, on which final decisions had to be made first thing on Monday morning. They also discussed the issue of the withdrawal of Mr Kupa's endorsement as ambassador to Jakarta.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was made aware by my staff at this time that there was important material to consider about the DIFF scheme and I undertook to examine the material the next day. On Monday morning my staff added the Habibie record to the material after it arrived from AusAID. The following morning, on the Monday before cabinet, I considered the final details of a departmental submission on the Sherman inquiry and signed off on that submission. I then attended the cabinet meeting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In preparation for question time I naturally enough focused on possible questions on the Miles Kupa matter and the Sherman inquiry. Obviously, with the benefit of hindsight, I regret I did not look at the DIFF material before question time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During question time, aware that this material still had to be examined, I on three occasions said that I would check if there was additional material relevant to my answer of 18 June. I did this so I would not mislead the House on Monday, 24 June, in case this material was pertinent to the issue of whether I had misled the House on 18 June. On examining the material late that afternoon, a record of conversation revealed that the Indonesian minister, Professor Ginandjar, had expressed his concern about the DIFF scheme during a conversation on 16 April. This reference is one paragraph in a 20&hyphen;paragraph record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of Dr Habibie, he referred to a specific DIFF project. He said that Indonesia was keen to see a particular project succeed. As with Professor Ginandjar, this was only mentioned briefly at the meeting, which, for the record, constitutes one paragraph out of 15. I was made aware before 18 June that a letter would come from Dr Habibie and this letter was passed to my office on 19 June, one day after my answer to the question in the House. Subsequently, in discussion with AusAID officers on 20 June, the arrival of this letter was referred to. I did not read the letter until the afternoon of Monday, 24 June and judged, probably erroneously, that, since I had received this letter after 18 June when I had made my comments to the House, it was therefore not germane to the issue as to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2782"> whether I had misled the parliament on 18 June, given that the letter had arrived after my initial statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since last Monday afternoon I have had AusAID and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade continue to examine every piece of paper we can find which may suggest that in any way there was ever a reference to DIFF in discussions with ministers. As a result of that search, my attention has been drawn this morning to a conversation with the Indonesian Minister for Industry and Trade, Tungky Ariwibowo, in which no mention was made of the DIFF scheme but he did refer to the heavy marine engineering training centre project. I have been told this morning that this is a DIFF project. No mention of DIFF was made in the record of conversation or at the meeting itself, but I include this at the first opportunity so there could be no uncertainty left in this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have also been shown this morning a record of a conversation I had with the Ambassador of the Philippines to Australia on 6 May 1996, during which the ambassador remarked that President Ramos had asked her to raise a particular project which was a DIFF funded project. I am bringing this to the House at the first available opportunity. I also signed a letter yesterday morning to the Philippines Secretary of Agrarian Reform in response to a letter from him on DIFF but, as is the normal practice, I was not aware of Secretary Garilao's letter until yesterday when I signed the reply. I did not know of the existence of this letter on 18 June or when I made my statement to the House on Monday evening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">AusAID, my department and my office have examined every piece of information we can find to see if there is any other reference to DIFF in any discussions with me. They have told me they have not been able to find anything else. I am not aware of any other information but, should I find other information, naturally I will inform the House as soon as practical. I cannot do more than that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This incident has arisen because of loose use of language by me in the environment of question time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising today to speak on this Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill, what leaps to my mind is the issue in Queensland of extended trading hours. That matter gives a very good insight into how trade unionism works in Australia today, or should I say how bad trade unionism works in Australia today. I had serious reservations <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> about the creation of these monster unions, these conglomerate unions, and I think that my apprehension has been vindicated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was a very enthusiastic supporter of enterprise bargaining but I must say that I am very disappointed in the way that enterprise bargaining has worked out. I think there are a number of serious problems that have arisen there that people like myself did not foresee, and it has not worked out for the average Australian worker at all. I do not think that it has brought the great benefits that we expected to flow to industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me come back to the first point, the extended trading hours issue in Queensland. In the Mundingburra by&hyphen;election, the ex&hyphen;ALP member, Mr Davies, in addressing a gathering of some 500 small business people said that the decision taken there was the result of an agreement worked out between the relevant unions covering retailing in the state of Queensland and the big retail traders. Presumably that would be Coles Myer, Woolworths and Franklins.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They promised the union involved total site coverage; that is, every single one of their employees would become a member of a trade union. That money would not be paid by the employee himself; it would be taken out of his pay by his employer and sent to the trade union. On that basis, the trade union shifted its ground and endorsed the proposal for extended trading hours. Some of the employees working in these retail establishments are working for as little as $5 an hour; in reality, it is sometimes even worse than that, because they are asked to do extra jobs after hours and they know that, if they do not do them, they will not have jobs to go back to. They are not game to complain, because of the high unemployment levels. If they complain, they will find themselves out on the dole queues very swiftly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These people were fed to the wolves. The trade union movement in Queensland had consistently opposed the extension of trading hours, because it would force people to work longer hours for relatively less pay per hour. There would most certainly be no excess pay per hour, because, at the present moment, if <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2784"> you work over those extended trading hours you have to be paid time and a half or double time. It can be argued; admittedly, it can be argued the other way, too. But it most certainly can be argued that there is no increase in income for the people working those long and very late hours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason that the trade union movement changed its position was in order to get bigger union membership for itself. So, to increase their income, unions sold out the employees whom they were paid to represent. I have seen unions do that again and again. In all fairness, there are some unions that have been genuine. They may have been excessive in other cases, but I must single out the CFMEU as a union that has not done that. I have seen a number of cases wherein they must have been sorely tempted to do it. But they have not sold out their membership and I think it is only right that I separate them out. There are good unions and bad unions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of the extended trading hours, we saw a very dangerous mechanism working. That mechanism has now been working for some time. It will be ironic to read in the history books that the people who built that mechanism were, in fact, members of the Labor Party. I can speak with authority of my own state, and that is why they got slaughtered&mdash;both in the state elections, in the industrial areas, and federally&mdash;in the state of Queensland. In fact, they were left with only two seats in all of Queensland&mdash;neither of them industrial seats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is rather interesting that neither of those seats could be remotely thought of as industrial seats. When one thinks of industrial seats, one must think about the member for Capricornia (Mr Marek)&mdash;a former trade union official&mdash;and me. I very briefly served as a union rep as well. I also represent a very industrial seat, in the industrial heartland of Queensland, among the coalminers and the hard rock miners of Queensland. There is hardly a single miner in Queensland who is not represented by the National Party in this House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I suppose we have a responsibility to come here today and offer a small word of praise for a union that has played it square by <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> its membership, from where I sit. I say that also because we have the issue of fly&hyphen;ins, which is very serious for us. The employee has to live at the mine site, and his family lives in a town or city some thousands of kilometres away. The Century proposal is to fly workers in from Brisbane, so I do not know how they could have families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You go out and get a job to look after your family, but how can you look after your family when you are living 1,000 or more kilometres away from it? It seems a little bit extraordinary to me. When your son is playing football, you like to be there to see him. When your daughter is speaking in a public speaking competition, or playing basketball, you like to be there. When one of them breaks a leg or an arm, or there is some other trauma at home, you should be there. But there is no hope of your being there, of course, because you are over 1,000 kilometres away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once again, there are unions in Queensland that let this happen, or facilitated its happening, so that they could get site coverage of these new mines. There are other unions that have fought fairly courageously and tenaciously against it and, of course, damaged their own ability to get site coverage on these new mines in the state of Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must praise the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith). Like many people, I suppose, we have apprehensions when our side of the House goes into an area which most of us are not skilled in. I exempt the member for Capricornia and I suppose to some degree myself, who have some experience in these areas, but the vast bulk of people on this side of the House are not experienced in the area of looking after the employee nor in understanding his situation. I viewed with very great apprehension the proposed changes that were coming forward. But I must say, having listened to a number of trade union officials who briefed me before I was to speak here today, that I was agreeably surprised that we did not have the really serious problems that a lot of people were expecting to come forward as a result of this legislation. It has been very difficult for the minister and I really go out of my way to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2785"> praise the minister for what he has achieved here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that in certain areas a little bit more flexibility is needed. When I was an employee I worked under a very rigorous demarcation system and I thought it was very unfair to the corporation for which I worked&mdash;and mind&hyphen;numbingly stupid and inefficient. To see those things changed is most certainly a move in the right direction of building in more flexibility. I think what is happening here is a finetuning and a building&hyphen;in of more flexibility where it is needed; and it has also preserved what is so essential, the right to collectively bargain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we remove the right to collectively bargain, as an employee, that puts me in a position of having to go up to my boss and say, `Look, I want some more wages' or `Look, I think it is really dangerous for us to keep working on line 601 because the pelletiser is not in a safe condition.' I get the reputation for being a troublemaker and I am going to lose my job. Unless I have got the right to collectively bargain and I have an outside person, my union representative, to come in and represent me in these areas, we are moving into a very dangerous and most unhealthy and unhappy situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are certain areas of the legislation&mdash;I do not want to go into any fine detail; I do not think it is an appropriate approach to the subject to do that&mdash;that give me some worry. If a union has gone in for its members and negotiated an enterprise agreement, a workplace agreement, I think that the members of that union should get the benefit. I think that other people that refuse to join that union should not necessarily do so, and I emphasise `necessarily'. My own son was in this situation and I said, `If you want to get the benefits of what these people have fought for to get and to deliver to you, the onus is upon you to pay the union dues.' He said, `Part of the money goes to the ALP. I am not going to do that.' I said, `I still think you have to do that in spite of that rather pernicious aspect, if you like, of the arrangements.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> I give considerable praise to the minister. He has taken some criticism from the employ er and big business side, that the changes have not gone anywhere near far enough. But we have a situation where in the Labor years the average Australian worker has lost seven per cent of his purchasing power. Last time I did the figures, average weekly earnings were lagging behind the CPI by about six or seven per cent. Then, of course, there is a huge increase in taxation in the federal budget. I cannot quote you the exact figure but I think it has gone from $40,000 million to $120,000 million. So, even though it is a deficit budget to some degree, there is an almost 300 per cent higher taxation regime now than there was in 1983. That carves a whopping great 16 per cent off the average worker's income. So the average Australian worker has taken a terrible hiding over the Labor years and is 23 per cent worse off now than he was in 1983. I would not like to see him placed in a weak bargaining position when he has already lost 23 per cent of his income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be improper for me to speak today without making reference to a very prominent trade union personality in North Queensland, a person who has gone out into the business world and done very well there in recent years. Mr Ken Knuth has been a great advocate in North Queensland. He was president of the Meat Workers Union in the biggest meatworks in Queensland at the time, the Pentland Meatworks outside Charters Towers. For a brief period, that meatworks had the biggest kill in Queensland. He was president of the union there, the AMIU.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ken is a great believer in the secret ballot. He said that continually, and this was very true of the AMIU. There were a number of stoppages; I think there were three in the space of five years. One of them was for two days. The stoppages were over social matters&mdash;social decisions taken by the state government which had absolutely nothing to do with the interests of trade unionists and most certainly nothing whatsoever to do with the interests of meatworkers. Yet these people were forced to go out and sacrifice a day's pay or two days pay over this issue. In fact, the vast bulk of them at the Cape River meatworks were in favour of what the Queensland government was doing.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2786">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He said that if a secret ballot had been able to be taken at the local place of work, then they would never have gone out and there would not have been that disruption and loss of pay for a lot of people. In one case there was two days loss of pay. These people live from payday to payday and they are in desperate trouble with their grocer, their local supermarket and various other people to whom they owe money if that money does not come and if they lose two days pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John Maitland was always wont to say that people on my side of politics are constantly worried about strikes. He said that it is enormously difficult to get people to stay out for more than two or three days. He said that they owe money and really the danger in modern society is that we do not have the strike weapon available to us at all. He said that whilst you never use it, unless you are very incompetent, in very, very extenuating circumstances, by the same token, as a weapon it has really lost an awful lot of its sting. That is another reason why I think that the legislation that should have been coming forward should have been fairly moderate sort of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have another area of concern, which people who are not familiar with unions should be made well aware of. The legislation does not go into this area and maybe it should have. The ability of a particular line of work to have its own specialist separate union is very, very important. When the fettlers in the railway were more or less forced into the ARU they were really not looked after at all. It was a union that was controlled by the running men and those sorts of people, and the fettlers were left out. Whilst the running men had very decent homes and airconditioned sleeping quarters, the fettlers were still on dirt floors without reticulated water supply. They should have had the right to form their own separate union for that particular area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The firefighters in Queensland wanted to break away from the AWU, and I always thought that they had a very good case. When a union becomes very big, it becomes, like all big organisations, neglectful of small minority groups inside its own organisation and those areas do not get looked after. Take the exam ple of the very legendary Clarrie Fallon of the AWU. The forestry workers in Queensland got off side of Clarrie and did not have a log of claims put in for some four years. They went without any log of claims being put forward as punishment for having questioned his opinion on a particular issue. I was told the story by my own father, but I noticed it also figured prominently in Clyde Cameron's book.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Clarrie Fallon figures of the trade union movement were, some might argue, drunk with power. Most certainly they were enormously powerful people, and some treated some of the minority groups in their union extremely shabbily. If a group wants to break away and form its own union, I really think that that is something that should be allowed for. I really think that the new legislation does allow for that to some degree.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to praise the minister once again, because I think that he has done a really excellent job. To go into this enormously controversial area and to be able to come out of it with virtually no criticism and a remarkable amount of praise from all sides is really a very laudable achievement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been very worried, because I think the average employee in Australia has had it very rough over the last 12 or 13 years. They have lost 23 per cent of their income. To further undermine their right to collectively bargain would be deeply troubling for me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make all of those remarks in the hope that we can go into an era where there is a little bit more flexibility where it is needed, yet preserve our right to collectively bargain. Without it, ours would be a very sad Australian society.</PARA></SPEECH>

<ELECTORATE> (Isaacs)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(1.56 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I might commence my remarks on this fairly heinous bill by saying that perhaps the hub of the wheel around which Australian society revolves is the right to a fair go: a fair go to recipients of social security benefits, to enable them to live a decent life; a fair go for manufacturers and exporters, who may receive some incentives and subsidies to encourage them to compete in international markets; and a fair go, of course, for Aboriginals, who endure life spans significantly less than those <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2787"> enjoyed by other Australians and who should rightly be compensated for the decimation of their culture.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The mature and considered industrial relations system that has been developing and evolving in Australia since the strike&hyphen;torn era presided over by the Fraser government&mdash;and, indeed, since times before that&mdash;has been premised on the fact that the bargaining relationship between the employer and the employee is by nature not one in which the concept of that same `fair go' prevails. Left to market forces, the employer will always have the upper hand. Historically, a fair go in that context has not always prevailed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The workplace relations bill undermines each of the three key foundations on which both a fair go and rights to decent living standards are built and premised. The first of those is the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and its role as an independent umpire in the workplace. The second of those is the right of workers and unionists to organise and bargain collectively. The third, of course, is the award system itself. To put it in somewhat of an anatomical context, awards will be gutted, the umpire will be hamstrung, and a blind eye will be turned towards workplace exploitation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All Australians&mdash;both those for whom the concept of a fair go comes relatively easily and those who obtain a fair go through their access to government services&mdash;will live in an Australian society which, by my standards, will be inherently less fair. It will be less fair because, in totality, each of these three measures will lead to a lowering of the standards of living of Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill, if enacted, will indeed adversely affect the weak and the disempowered in the community: I cite, amongst those, women, part&hyphen;timers, migrants and the young. Women have historically achieved greater pay equity with men under the award system than outside of it. That is something that the member for Lindsay (Ms Jackie Kelly) might want to reflect upon, following her submission to the House this morning. Statistics show that, on average, women under awards receive 93.8 per cent of men's wages, yet women receive <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> only 54.7 per cent, on average, of over&hyphen;award payments received by men.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The message is clear. Where wages have been set by direct negotiation rather than by the Industrial Relations Commission, women have been severely disadvantaged in comparison with men. The government's industrial relations bill will compel women to enter into direct negotiations with employers. Whilst all employees risk losing out on those negotiations, women, in my view, will remain particularly vulnerable. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very happy to answer this question from the member for Perth. As I have said previously elsewhere outside the House but for the first time in the House, the matter of DIFF and its termination has been raised with me at various levels here in Australia and overseas. It was raised, for example, in the course of a visit to the Philippines. On 22 April, the Philippines foreign secretary, Siazon, raised it with me indirectly. President Ramos raised it with me, and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2788"> further letters have come from various ministers in that context as well as at other levels.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These matters were raised in the context of the overall bilateral relationship and, to take that example of the Australia&hyphen;Philippines bilateral relationship, it is true that there are some DIFF projects which will continue to receive funding under the termination arrangements. The funding is some $20 million plus for this coming financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point I would want to make very clear&hyphen;cut is that our bilateral relations are based on a range of factors, not the least of which was the announcement I made in the Philippines of a $6&half; million FMD aid project for the Philippines to help withstand a particular animal disease. That was warmly welcomed by the Philippines ministers and seen as part of an ongoing commitment to the relations between Australia and the Philippines.

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member's question covers an issue that is of continuing debate in the Australian community. The view of the government is that, if this matter comes before the parliament for determination or vote, as far as the coalition parties are concerned, any response to that will be determined on a conscience or individual basis. I respect the fact that within my own party and within the National Party&mdash;and I dare say it is the case within the Australian Labor Party as well&mdash;there are a range of views strongly held on this subject. In the past I have made <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2789"> it clear&mdash;and I repeat it today&mdash;that, speaking as an individual, I have the strongest possible reservations about the legislation passed by the Northern Territory parliament. But I respect the fact that there are other people of good conscience who hold a diametrically opposed view and I would not seek to impose my personal view on anybody.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There remains the question, against that background, of how the Commonwealth government should respond to the action launched by certain individuals and by the Northern Territory branch of the Australian Medical Association challenging the constitutional validity of the Northern Territory legislation. The Commonwealth has been named as a defendant in that legislation. We have decided that steps should be taken to have the Commonwealth removed as a defendant as it is clearly legislation at the instance of the Northern Territory parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also decided that it is not appropriate, at this stage at least, consonant with our view about this being a conscience issue, for the Commonwealth to be arguing either  for or against the validity of the Northern Territory legislation. I think that is the correct stance for us to take and the stance that is most consonant with the view that it is a conscience issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I simply make two other comments. The first is that it is, of course, open to any member of this parliament, if he or she feels strongly about this issue, to introduce a private member's bill. It would not be the desire of the government to hamper a consideration of the issue. But that is a matter for individual initiative and it is not something, consistent with our view on this being a conscience issue, that the government would seek to sponsor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The final matter relates to the question of the entitlement under the Medicare arrangements of Australia for any procedures which might be carried out under the Northern Territory legislation. As many members will know, the minister for health has a specific ministerial discretion in relation to those benefits. The minister has informed me and informed the government that he has sought the advice of the Australian Medical Associa tion regarding how he should exercise that discretion under the Medicare arrangements. When that advice has been received the government will give the matter further consideration, taking, of course, into consideration the advice of the minister for health. I should make it clear that, whilst we will be interested to know the view of the Australian Medical Association and will pay very heavy regard to that view, we will not be automatically bound to accept the advice of the Australian Medical Association.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I have become aware of a continuing policy of economic vandalism which is being led by the Australian Labor Party in the Senate and where other opposition parties in the Senate are joining in. It is clear that, after 13 years of failed government, the Australian Labor Party is now doing its best to frustrate all attempts to improve the Australian economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me take areas where the Australian Labor Party is even turning on policies which it introduced. In relation to the Development Allowance Authority, a bill which is currently in the Senate, the Australian Labor Party, in conjunction with the Australian Democrats, have taken the opportunity to tack onto that bill proposals to take away infrastructure borrowings in relation to urban road projects. Their proposal to do that is a proposal to sabotage about 40 projects with an investment value of $2.5 billion over the next six years. It is a proposal to sabotage about 18 projects in the mining industry, 10 in the tourism industry, six in the electricity, gas and water industry, four in the manufacturing industry, and three in the transport and storage industry. It is an action which puts the federal Labor Party directly at odds with the New South Wales Labor Party and led to the undignified spectacle of federal spokesmen <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> attacking state spokesmen in relation to the Eastern distributor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not only in relation to infrastructure borrowings. It is also in relation to the tariff concessions system. Before the election, the Australian Labor Party proposed to abolish the tariff concessions system altogether. It was this government that ameliorated the effect of that policy by reducing the impact from five to three per cent. Yet we see in today's paper that the Australian Labor Party refuses to accept the modification of that and is putting that at risk in the Senate also.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it is not just the tariff concession system either; it is the sale of Telstra&mdash;an initiative which this government, in relation to part&hyphen;privatisation, has announced, with an overwhelming support of the Australian people, to set up the greatest land fund this country has ever seen, to retire debt to take some of the debt burden off future generations of Australia&mdash;which this opposition is also trying to frustrate in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me make clear the utter hypocrisy of the opposition in relation to that. When questioned about what they would do if Telstra were part&hyphen;privatised, whether they would renationalise it after coming to office, they say, `Oh no, we would accept the situation and we would take the money.' Where is the principle in relation to that? In other words, `We will make it as difficult as possible for you as a government, but if you make the hard yards, we as an Australian Labor Party would be the first in there to try to take the benefits.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was a party that left Australia with an $8 billion deficit, which left Australia with high interest rates, which left it with a legacy of debt, and now is doing everything it can to frustrate the efforts that are required to build it back again, to alleviate the debt, to get the finances into position and to take the pressure off monetary policy. This is an opposition which has no credibility, makes no constructive performance in the Senate and which is condemned even in relation to its own policies.</PARA>

<ANSWER PAGE="2791" SPEAKER="Howard, John, MP" NAMEID="ZD4" ELECTORATE="Bennelong" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Prime Minister" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My attention has been drawn to some remarks made this morning on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS>  program by Mr Noel Pearson, in which he made a number of comments concerning my attitude towards the decision of the High Court of Australia in the Mabo case. I want to take this opportunity to explicitly repudiate what Mr Pearson said and also to tell the House that when confronted with an earlier denial of mine today, when addressing the National Press Club, Mr Pearson did not repeat the allegations he had made on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS>  program this morning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What he said was that, in essence, I have never accepted the decision of the High Court of Australia. He implied that I had a continuing prejudice against the Aboriginal people's benefits arising from that decision. In making those claims, Mr Pearson was stating an untruth. Mr Pearson was doing a great disservice to the Aboriginal people and he was deliberately prejudicing the cause of good relations between the Aboriginal community and the coalition government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make no secret of the fact that the new government of this country adopts a different approach, in some respects, from its predecessor in the area of Aboriginal affairs. But I challenge Mr Pearson, I challenge anybody opposite and I challenge any Australian interested in this area to scour the record and find any remarks of mine which have been critical of the decision of the High Court of Australia in the Mabo case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that I have always regarded the Mabo decision itself as being a justified, correct decision. I have stated that on a number of occasions. My criticism of Mabo is not the High Court's decision but the, I think, unwarranted extensions of it engaged in by the former Labor government. My criticism is of Labor's handling of Mabo, not of the Mabo decision itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While we are on the subject of Mr Pearson, his credentials in this debate are somewhat flawed by his partisan alliance with the Australian Labor Party. For example, on 23 <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2792"> February 1996 this is what Mr Pearson had to say when he was talking of the coalition campaign:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Liberals' racist and divisive campaign slogan is a scary condensation of an uninclusive government for middle Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>That was after he had been photographed with the former Prime Minister in the gulf area, clearly supporting the Labor Party's position. Mr Pearson has a perfect right as an Australian citizen to align himself with the Australian Labor Party. That is his perfect, democratic right. But if he presumes to represent the interests of the Aboriginal people, I would advise him to correctly interpret and quote my views on the High Court decision. I counsel him against misrepresenting the attitude that I have taken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new government of Australia seeks a basis of cooperation with the Aboriginal communities of Australia. We are committed to the principles of the Native Title Act. We believe in an Australian community where all races are united with the hope of a common destiny and an equal future. But I do not accept some of the socially divisive approaches to Aboriginal affairs that have been urged by some members who sit opposite and which have been advocated on occasions by people like Mr Noel Pearson.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DG4">Mr TIM FISCHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Mallee for his question. I advise the House that I am most concerned about the extraterritorial trend in US law making and its  implication for Australian companies. This issue has arisen recently because of the Helms&hyphen;Burton legislation, which provides for the imposition of penalties against foreign companies involved in commercial activities with Cuba, and a similar D'Amato legislation, which relates to Iran sanctions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At this point, I am not aware that any Australian company has had to withdraw from operations in Cuba or Iran as a result of US extraterritorial legislation, but companies are continuing to follow developments closely. I am keen to ensure that the US understands our basic problems with this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Extraterritorial measures are inconsistent with basic principles of international law. They seek to impose punitive measures on third&hyphen;country investors and impinge on the sovereignty of other countries. Australia argues that the most effective way for the US to achieve foreign policy objectives is to work closely and cooperatively with its partners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I during recent visits to Washington have expressed to senior representatives of the US administration and to Congress our opposition to such legislation. Additionally, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2793"> we have outlined that to members of the G7, meeting later this month.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, there is widespread international concern about this trend in law making. For instance, the Cairns Group meeting, which I chaired in Columbia earlier this month, expressed its `strong concern about unilateral and extraterritorial actions which create dangerous precedent and potential threats to the multilateral trade and investment regime.' Members can be assured, particularly the member for Mallee, that Australia will do all that it can to persuade the US authorities on this issue.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. A paper, `Land degradation and Australian agricultural industries' by research economist Mr Paul Gretton, was released this week. It was reported that almost 50 per cent of agricultural land in Victoria, about one-third of agricultural land in New South Wales and 15 per cent of agricultural land in Queensland was very seriously degraded. It is clear that the commitment by governments to this point of time has been insufficient. How do you propose to address this serious national challenge?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4K4">Mr ANDERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Dawson for this very important question that she has just raised. The report to which the member refers has confirmed what we have known for some time but have tended not to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2796"> pay enough attention to&mdash;that is, the extent of land degradation in Australia is far greater than many people would at first think.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, in our highly urbanised society, where the problem is to a great extent out of sight, it is, therefore, sometimes out of mind. We can lose an understanding of how critically important our land and our soils, and what they produce, are to supporting our way of life. The cost not just to farmers but to regional economies, to our external account and, in a very real sense, to future generations is extraordinarily high&mdash;hundreds of millions of dollars a year in today's terms; heaven only knows what in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> That being the case, a significant increase in the level of commitment by government is required to assist in the task of addressing the problems. The farm community wants to address the problems. When it can&mdash;thanks largely to the sorts of policies that have been imposed upon it in recent years&mdash;it often finds it hard to muster sufficient resources. Government has a role to play as well, in terms not only of restoring the profitability of the farm community but also in addressing other issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The approach to date has, quite frankly, been insufficient. The previous government thought that a few small funding programs tossed around to cover the environmental issues that happened to be the flavour of the day would be enough&mdash;pretty systematic of the way in which they approached politics. Obviously what they did was insufficient.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> This government clearly recognises the seriousness of the issue of land degradation. We have in place the largest and the most comprehensive integrated&mdash;I emphasise the word `integrated'&mdash;plan in the history of the nation to redress the problems that we face, of which the one alluded to by the member is just one but a very important one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We want to get on with the job, we need to get on with the job and we want to start now. It has to be said again, and said until everyone's got the message, that any obstruction to the Natural Heritage Trust legislation will lead to further environmental damage. That is the reality. It will mean that further valuable natural resources will be destroyed <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> because of the wilful actions of the opposition, wilful environmental vandalism. That is what it is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ALP approach to the environment has been flawed in the past; it is flawed at the moment. I finish by making this observation: it records no respect for future Australians, let alone current Australians, because in the terminology used recently in this place by the Treasurer what they are doing is engaging in nothing less than a form of intergenerational theft. We have to take actions now to secure the future for generations that follow.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

The committee has analysed research on the subject of the portrayal of violence and its impact and has received submissions from the public. Currently there are in excess of 600 submissions received from the public, demonstrating the level of interest by the public in the issue and the importance of the work of the committee.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That this House censures the Minister for Foreign Affairs for his repeated misleading of the House on regional concerns with the abolition of the DIFF program and calls upon him to resign.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no question at all that this House has been misled in a fashion which in normal terms would produce a resignation of a minister concerned. One can only conclude from these proceedings that the minister is not resigning because there is some arrangement that he entered into at the period of time when he became the shadow foreign spokesman that protects him from the normal course of events.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, I have only to cite the one example. There were resignations while we were in office and it is not unusual for ministers to go. There are many grounds on which they go. They are usually preceded by a degree of pressure in parliament and that pressure is usually in the first instance resisted. It was so in this case. I draw the attention of the House to the resignation letter of J.J. Brown, who was a minister who resigned for inadvertently misleading the House. I ask you to contrast the circumstances surrounding his resignation, which was sought by the then opposition, and those that we have contemplated here over the last eight sorry days. He said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After examining the documents on file relating to the composition and decisions of the Expo tender assessment panel, it has become apparent to me that I misled the parliament on 10 December when I stated that there had been a tied vote on the relevant decision on 21 March this year. My statement to the parliament was made in complete good faith, in the honest but mistaken belief that the two public servant members of the panel were not entitled to vote but were simply present to ensure that proper tender procedures were followed. I had always genuinely believed this to be the case and I had no intention whatever to deceive the parliament when I said as much last week. I have been shown to be wrong on the facts, but my conscience is and will remain completely clear. Because of my respect for the institution of parliament, I feel that I have no alternative in all the circumstances but to resign as the minister.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>Contrast the circumstances of his resignation with the charade that we have been subjected to over the last eight days by the Minister for <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer). There can be no comparison between that particular answer dealing with that largely irrelevant matter in public policy and the centrality of the issues that go to the heart of our relationship with the region around us, that determine the conditions of survival and prosperity of this country and that have to be defended by a minister who is capable of respect in the region around him, is capable of having his integrity regarded as unimpugned, is capable of being dealt with in a forthright fashion and is capable of knowing that when he presents himself in this place he presents himself on a basis of honesty and truthfulness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There can be no doubt whatsoever either that he has massively gone against the recommendations and requirements imposed upon him by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), who likes to regard them as unique standards. But, having had a look through his particular propositions, I cannot see anything there that did not apply to our government and our ministers. It must now be regarded as a book of humour by John Howard on the question of what ought to be the conditions of ministerial propriety. There can be no doubt either about what is required not simply by John Howard as Prime Minister but by anyone else who has ever looked at the records of parliament over the years. The guide on ministerial responsibility states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any answer which may be found to be incorrect should be corrected as soon as the error is found, using the procedures of the House concerned.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the position given to the ministers as to what they ought to do in regard to this. Now the Minister for Foreign Affairs has stated that he was aware of a letter from Dr Habibie&mdash;the circumstances of which would have been clear to him before he went into question time on the first day, on 18 June. He says now, `I probably erroneously thought that was the case.' I ask him to look at those particular propositions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you have thought erroneously that you actually had a piece of information before you that you did not properly utilise in question time, why were you not correcting it, coming to that particular conclusion, until eight days and numerous lousy press headlines later? He <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2799"> was very disparaging of the Australian press in his remarks on that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no question in my mind that it is not just the pressure of this House that has brought him to account here, but also the endless embarrassment that he has caused the government, himself and this nation in the media both here and overseas. It brought him into this place to make that shoddy, shabby and, above all, incomplete statement to the House on his own culpability in this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very interesting too because the former Leader of the Opposition, now Prime Minister, had a great deal to say about this sort of behaviour when he himself was in opposition. What did he say about the true Westminster position? He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The true Westminster principle of ministerial accountability is simple in practice and almost universally misunderstood. That is, you resign if your continued presence will do damage to the government or cause the government acute embarrassment.</PARA>
<PARA>So he comes down not only on the grounds of what he ought to have done by any requirement placed upon him by any Prime Minister at any point in time in this nation's history but also on a special criterion that was put up&mdash;that is, the continuing embarrassment that would be caused to the government and the people of this country by his presence. Under these circumstances, he is attempting to cling to office now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I go back to that particular proposition he made this morning when he dropped his statement after his 1&half;&hyphen;hour cabinet meeting, or whatever it was, in which he explained himself to his colleagues and the damage that he had done them. After he explained himself, he came in here. What an extraordinary statement it was. I was made aware before 18 June that a letter would come from Dr Habibie, and this letter was passed to my office on 19 June&mdash;one day after I got an answer to a question I asked in the House. No doubt there was no point in making him aware of what the content of the letter would be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not a euphemistic letter that you have to delve through to work out whether or not it in some way or another related to the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> DIFF program. This is a letter that is about as strident, albeit cast in polite terms, as anyone would receive from a foreign minister. I will just go to two particular parts of it. This project is of concern to Dr Habibie and no doubt was probably raised with him in his conversations with Dr Habibie. If anyone has had a conversation with Dr Habibie about anything that interests Dr Habibie, they will know those conversations are memorable. It is simply not possible to conclude that he would fail to recollect that conversation with Dr Habibie a month or so later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In case he forgot it, his memory was triggered for him. Remember, his memory was again triggered about Dr Habibie's concerns before he went into question time on 18 June. So it is very passing strange that he could not recollect until Monday that there were a couple of conversations with a couple of Indonesian ministers&mdash;one of them being Dr Habibie.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This project that he refers to in his letter of 13 June was proposed in 1995 to the Australian government to be financed under AusAID projects. A series of activities were carried out to pursue the government commitment; the most important item that has to be finalised is the letter of offer for financing the project from AusAID to the government of Indonesia. Since the DIFF scheme under AusAID has been terminated recently, the funding commitments of the Australian government may not be available. Serious problems may arise due to this evidence since the government of Indonesia has been committed to perform the project in the fiscal year 1996-97 for the 10 provinces in the eastern region of Indonesia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is no small matter. It is a matter entered into with the Indonesian government. The Indonesian government has sat down with Australian officials over a lengthy period of time&mdash;and, for all we know, Alexander Downer at a particular period&mdash;to emphasise a project in 10 provinces. The Australian government has given them every reason to believe it will be concluded with the assistance of the DIFF program. He has told them that it is all out the window as far as this government is concerned.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2800">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want people in this House or anywhere else to underestimate the damage that this DIFF stuff is doing us. You must not underestimate the fiendish damage this is doing our reputation in Asia&mdash;the massive damage that it is doing to our reputation for reliability. Those in Asia do not actually sit down and discuss the Australian budget. As far as they are concerned, they are at one with the Prime Minister, when the Prime Minister said that he took over a country that was well managed and with a good economy. As far as they are concerned, that represents Australia as far as we have an economic personality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But here we have fellows wandering around playing games with them&mdash;playing the games that they play here with us in opposition as they try to cover what was an agenda that they had in place years ago. They play games with us in opposition. But the problem is: they play their games where it matters. The game that you play against us in this place does not matter. But it matters like heck when you play that game with the survival and reputation of this nation in the region around us&mdash;as you as foreign minister have done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part of that game you have engaged in has caused you to get an extraordinary headline&mdash;within the context of the way in which the Indonesian media operates&mdash;in a very credible journal in Indonesia. It has characterised you very accurately with a characterisation that we are not allowed any longer to use in this place in censure motions. But they did not miss you. They did not miss you when they went through you on that particular day in that particular item.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we are confronted with this damage you have done us as a result of the way in which you have conducted your diplomacy and the deceit of that diplomacy, the absolute deceit of that diplomacy, with you going around telling these nations that you discovered after the election an urgent program when you know darn well that this DIFF proposition was proposed not to deal with any suddenly unexpected change in Australia's budgetary circumstances&mdash;you run away from this all the time&mdash;but was to pay for your miserable election pork&hyphen;barrelling. You do not even <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have the excuse that we were competing with you on it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There you were, 10 per cent, 14 per cent ahead in the polls. You had all of our policy out there, for months ahead of the election, being argued by us. There you had our very modest proposals put in place during the course of the election campaign. You had nothing to compete with. You were on a lay&hyphen;down misere to win. But what do you do? You come in and you say, `Well, we are going to pork&hyphen;barrel like billyo, and it doesn't matter what.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part of that extraordinary pork&hyphen;barrelling was to abolish the DIFF scheme&mdash;just straight out the window&mdash;`We will abolish the DIFF scheme and we will pay for a few little electoral bribes here and there around Australia. We will wreck Australia's foreign relationships. We will get out there and wreck Australia's foreign relationships just for the sake of a miserable extra seat or two in what is going to be a massive win.' That is a disgraceful performance by you in opposition which you have compounded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you were any decent sort of foreign minister, what you would have done after that would have been to get up on your scrapers before the intimidators, such as your former deputy, Mr Costello, and the others, and say, `Listen, Sport, it's all right for you to argue your garbage in parliament, but when you are actually dealing with people overseas you have to deal with them with a bit more integrity than that. You let this off the hook, as you go round scouring, abusing and intimidating your colleagues, because there is a bit of Australian national interest at stake.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Educate him. He is a very ignorant man on public policy. Educate him. That was your job as foreign minister. But you could not educate him because you are not educated yourself. You are not in a position to be able to comprehend these sorts of issues. You have flammered around the countryside for years and years, spouting off the top of your head the first thing that comes into it, cracking churlish and silly little schoolboy jokes all over the countryside. We might have expected that the man would grow in office or the boy <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2801"> would have grown into it. But we were sadly mistaken in that expectation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we got in this parliament was a continuation of the blow&hyphen;hardery, until you finally actually had to confront the issues, as you confronted it here today. I said the other day that I thought your affairs were something out of Monty Python. Sit down and take a look at your statement this day; how extraordinary it was. Go back to the 18th: `Not one has raised this with me, not one&mdash;except Dr Habibie, before I said it, in a letter to me; then Dr Habibie; Professor Ginandjar; and I find the President of the Philippines, the foreign minister of the Philippines, the minister for foreign trade in China.' Not one! We are now up to about seven. It is a most extraordinary performance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But even with all of that&mdash;and I think perhaps the people in the gallery and the public generally are tired of this&mdash;contemplate the answers of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer). We have had a whole lot of stuff out here. We have had Alexander Downer coming in here this morning, wrapping his coat around himself and saying, `This record is complete.' Where did we hear that before? We heard that on Monday&mdash;and we heard it on Tuesday: `This record is complete.' But when we ask a question of the Deputy Prime Minister in this government's baring of all, this government's `total hang&hyphen;out' as President Nixon used to talk of, we find that the total hang&hyphen;out is a limited hang&hyphen;out, the sort of limited hang&hyphen;out that the President of the United States in those days was so beloved of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It came out in this place and up jumps the Deputy Prime Minister as bright as a button&mdash;`I am not going to tell you of any conversations that I have had with my ministerial counterpart.' Well, beauty; thank you, Tim. We might have thought that on this particular occasion you would have been able to say to us, `Well, no, at no point of time have I been reminding Mr Downer of the multiplicity of statements that have come through to be contemplated.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the Minister for Trade. He is in the same department as the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The Minister for Trade has, on what <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Mr Fischer was saying, numerous representations made to him personally at all levels. Mr Fischer has been receiving those in multiplicity over the course of the last three months. Are we seriously to believe that Mr Fischer has not mentioned to the minister responsible in his own portfolio that he has been receiving these representations? Are we to believe that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we don't believe that, what does that make of Alexander Downer's statement this morning? What does it make of his statement this morning if we are to believe that after all those representations there probably is a likelihood that they were mentioned to him? Yet again, the record is not complete. Despite the assurances of the Prime Minister, despite the assurances of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, we do not have a complete record before us. Even if the Deputy Prime Minister did not feel constrained to tell us what the conversations were between them, he made darned sure we knew how the message would have been conveyed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have held the defence portfolio, which is related to foreign affairs, and we were basically drop copied with what went to the Minister for Foreign Affairs in a wide variety of areas. You know darned well that he was drop copied with absolutely everything Tim Fischer did when he went overseas. So Tim said, `Don't hunt me for my view. Hunt the record where you will find a plethora of mentions of this at ministerial level.' This minister has not felt free and not felt bound to present them to us here in this chamber. So you were dropped in it by your colleague. You were dropped it in comprehensively by your colleague&mdash;your colleague who has known that you have ill-served your government and ill-served it in the worst possible way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have here a situation that I find absolutely unprecedented in this place. Generally speaking, when people are caught as red&hyphen;handed as this they have the decency to stand up in this place, explain themselves and put the best possible gloss they can on it. They get up there and make mention of their great contribution to Australian public life and their hope that they will make it in the future and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2802"> their desire to see more of their family as the next few months go by and thank the electors for having looked after them so well for so long. In doing that they find no favour and the only thing that really matters to the Australian people is their resignation. That's what follows&mdash;their resignation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Resignation in this instance has not followed. The case for that resignation is absolutely clear cut. The foreign minister has repeatedly misled this House. He has misled it from the very first moment when he was aware of Dr Habibie's approach to him over the DIFF matter in particular&mdash;the most senior development minister in Indonesia. He was absolutely aware of that. He has been skipping through the raindrops ever since, trying to protect himself with dates, trying to protect himself with sleight of hand on the questions. What he has built up instead is a panoply of deceit. He ought to be censured by this place and dismissed by his Prime Minister. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This side of the House rejects this motion quite clearly. This is the third censure motion that has been moved by the opposition. It is not expected they should go down this path. On a radio program this morning I noticed it being said that they had moved two censures in a row and it was suggested that maybe there would be three in a row. There was a question about whether this was unusual. It is unusual for one reason&mdash;that is, the other side of politics, when they were in government, so frequently ran away from censures and just closed them down. The fact is that you never had the courage, and very seldom the decency, to stand up and make the arguments that needed to be made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have brought new standards to this government, we have brought new standards to the parliament, and we are very happy to uphold those standards. I said in my statement <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> today, with the greatest of candour, that this incident has arisen because of `loose use of language by me in the environment of question time'. If everybody who used language loosely in question time had to resign, this place would be empty because it is a frequent and common occurrence. I owed it to the House and to the government to ensure that the record was corrected. I have done that, and I have been happy to do that. That is part of the new standards that this government is very happy to set.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The argument of the opposition today seems, at the end of the day, to revolve around a newspaper headline. There is a newspaper headline in an Indonesian newspaper&mdash;an unflattering headline, I concede&mdash;and apparently therefore that is another argument for why I should resign. It begs the question whether in 1992 when there was a newspaper headline in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">South China Morning Post</EMPHASIS> reporting that the then foreign minister had made a tasteless joke about Deng Xiaoping that was a basis for resignation. Remember: `Evans in dog house over puppy joke' was the way the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper ran the headline.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not have the headline from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">South China Morning Post</EMPHASIS> but I might remind the House what the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans) said as foreign minister in 1992 when talking about the dog of the Governor of Hong Kong. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Governor's dog is probably a supreme delicacy. They'll turn it into hors d'oeuvres for Deng Xiaoping who, I'm told, eats four puppies a day.</PARA>
<PARA>That was an extraordinary thing to say, a bizarre thing to say. According to the measure of the sort of hyperbole from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), this is apparently something that fundamentally undermined Australia's interests at the time. I expect that at the end of the day the readers of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">South China Morning Post</EMPHASIS>  have managed to get over it and I don't doubt they no longer remember the statement at all. Whether Deng Xiaoping remembers, of course, might be another matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I came to the House today and made a full and comprehensive statement on the basis of all the material that we have available to us <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2803"> according to my department and AusAID, the aid agency within my portfolio. It was quite appropriate for me, as a minister of the Crown, to do that. I was happy to do that. Frankly, I think it has very substantially cleared the air on the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that the record of this government in the area of foreign policy over the last 3&half; months has been outstanding. For the Labor Party to whip up an enormous storm over what I described as `loose use of language by me in the environment of question time' is simply in order to shroud the achievements of this government in the area of foreign policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For all your boasting in foreign policy, for all the pompous boasting, as I said, during the election campaign, the former Minister for Foreign Affairs was inebriated by the exuberance of his own pomposity, always going on about the immense achievements of the government. Yet, when we came to office, one of the first things we had to do and one of the first things we did do was to start the job of repairing our relationship with Malaysia. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in particular has done an excellent job in the process of repairing that relationship, and I have obviously been happy to play my part.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was not the only relationship that needed to be restored. We needed to do a good deal of work to improve our relationship with New Zealand as well. It is a neighbouring     country, it is part of our region, and it was a country that regarded our relationship as having sunk to a new low because of the activities of the now shadow minister for foreign affairs. The simple fact is that, by my and the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) and others, including the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan), going to New Zealand and dealing with the New Zealand government&mdash;our Prime Minister meeting with the Prime Minister of New Zealand as well&mdash;we were able to restore that relationship to the excellent level it should be at.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We came to office with a relationship with the European Union that also was not in good shape. That was a point made perfectly clear to the National Press Club here in Canberra <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> by the Ambassador of the European Commission. What we have done is start the work of restoring that relationship and making sure that Australia's relationship not just with the European Commission but also with the member states of the European Union has been restored to the place it should be restored to. The European Union is extraordinarily important to the health of the Australian economy&mdash;being, after all, some 36 per cent or so of foreign direct investment in Australia. We have done that. We have started to restore that relationship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we have made great strides in developing relationships, above all, with the countries in our immediate region. We have given our highest foreign policy priority to engagement with our own region. We have indeed enjoyed excellent relationships with ministers in Indonesia and, particularly in this case, the Deputy Prime Minister in the Philippines, with ministers in Singapore, Thailand and, further afield, in Japan; and I am sure we will build on those close personal relationships that we have already been able to establish in just 3&half; months in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that we do not agree with every government about everything. Of course, there are some differences. But I think that in our region they understand only too well that this is a government which is committed to the region as its highest foreign policy priority and understands that the bulk of our work in foreign affairs will be to pursue engagement with our own region. This must be a priority for an Australian government. These are the big issues. These are the things that are important. These are the things which are crucial to the future of this country, not endless parliamentary time taken up because a minister&mdash;happy to concede the point&mdash;uses loose language in the environment of question time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that the Labor Party, having slipped from government to opposition, has slipped from thinking about issues which are fundamental to this country to playing parliamentary parlour games and very little else. The really big issues for this country are the issues that you have completely forgotten.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2804">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us just take this issue of DIFF. You would think, listening to the Labor Party nowadays, that this development import finance facility scheme was the only thing under Labor that anchored Australia to its own region. You would think it was the only thing in the relationship between Australia and our region and that abolishing it is somehow going to decimate&mdash;melt down&mdash;the relationships between Australia and our region. And that is how this debate arose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think, frankly, you could ever argue that our country was so flimsy and so weak that the only contribution it would make to its own region was a development import finance facility worth $124 million a year. Who in this House would remotely believe that fanciful proposition? The fact is that the development import finance facility is not part of the core of the relationship between Australia and countries in our region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we were confronted with the task of having to act with fiscal responsibility we ended up in the area of the aid budget having to make a choice. Either we cut out aid facilities such as this, which subsidises businesses, or else we cut humanitarian aid. One of the themes of this government has been to ensure that government is humane in the way it behaves. That is a theme that has emerged quite strongly in many of the policy areas of this government, including in our foreign policy. I think it would be wrong to give a greater priority to a business subsidy program&mdash;or, as one shadow minister said yesterday, to a trade program&mdash;than it would be to give the priority to humanitarian aid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think humanitarian aid has a higher priority than, if you like, a trade or economic program such as the DIFF program. I think humanitarian aid should be the priority. The fact is that you do not, but you make such an enormous issue of the development import finance facility&mdash;out of a $1&half; billion aid project, this is $124 million, about eight per cent of the aid budget&mdash;that we can only conclude that it is the only part of the aid budget that you think is of any importance. We could be excused for coming to that conclusion. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> It should be remembered that the former government very substantially reduced the amount of aid that Australia pays to Malaysia. I think that aid has been reduced to virtually nothing. There is still some aid through assistance to students, but there is very little over and above that. Was that reduction in aid to Malaysia responsible for the deterioration in our relationships with Malaysia? No. It was loose language by the former leader of the Labor Party which really did cost this country's interest. That is loose language that does damage. That is loose language that really is important. This particular exercise pales into insignificance by comparison.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party is trying to whip up an issue this week when, clearly, they do not have any other issue to run. I am very happy to have been able to come to this House today and make a statement and make it perfectly clear that, of course, I regret the incident that arose because of loose use of language by me, as I have often said, in the environment of question time. Of course I regret that. But I have fulfilled my responsibilities to the House. I have fulfilled my responsibilities as a minister of the Crown. I believe that this government has made an excellent impression in the international community in the first 3&half; months we have been in office. I believe that, as time goes on, in terms of foreign affairs we will go from strength to strength. We reject this censure motion.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is an issue which demands not a limp and flatulent statement of regret; it demands a statement of resignation. It demands a statement of resignation from a person who should not only not be a minister in this place as a result of having misled the House on the scale and to the extent that has become apparent over the last few days, but it is a motion of censure of someone who unquestionably should no longer be foreign minister of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there is one thing that counts for anything else in international relations it is personal integrity. It is the confidence people have in you and your word, your trust and your <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2805"> reliability. It is bad enough when you just engage in embarrassing personal behaviour like the bumbling gaucheries that became a matter of public notoriety after the recent visit of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) to Washington. It is bad enough when you make policy misjudgments of the kind that you have with your decision permanently to abort DIFF because you think it is a poor quality, dispensable form of aid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is bad enough when you make errors of judgment on major policy matters of the kind that you have just been found out on in Washington with the rejection out of hand of the ill-conceived idea that you have been promoting of pre-positioning of American stocks in the Australian mainland. It is bad enough when you make errors of judgment in the administration of your portfolio, as clearly has occurred on a very significant scale with the aborted appointment of Miles Kupa to Jakarta. It is bad enough when you play politics with people's personal hurt and distress, as you have been doing for months now in your previous capacity and now your present one with consular cases like that of Jacqueline Gillespie, David Wilson, John Flynn or James Peng.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of these things pale into relative insignificance when people around the region and around the world lose personal confidence in another foreign minister's integrity. Diplomats and ministers in international relations have to sometimes choose their words very carefully in order to avoid confrontation or embarrassment, in order to avoid security lapses and in order to in many other ways avoid undermining the national interest.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that the foreign minister's handling of this particular matter has breached every one of those guidelines of decent and sensible international relations. This is already becoming conspicuously apparent in the perceptions of this behaviour and this course of events that are emerging around the region. Today we have seen a spectacular example of it in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kompas</EMPHASIS>, one of Indonesia's leading daily newspapers, with a heading on the very front page saying, `Australian foreign minister lied about Habibie and Ginandjar'. The text of the article says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Alexander Downer twice did not give an accurate answer to the Australian parliament about talks with the Minister for Research and Technology, Dr Habibie, the Minister of National Planning, Mr Ginandjar, when he was in Jakarta last April.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is the second big mistake that Downer made this week and both in connection with Indonesia. A few days ago he acknowledged his mistake about the nomination of Miles Kupa as Australian ambassador because he did not know about the leaking of a report that had been written in 1992.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>There it is: a prominent, respected regional newspaper, picking up and running with what has become self-evident to all of us in this parliament and self-evident to anyone in the Australian public who has been following the course of this debate. It is self-evident around the region too. It has already put Australia's reputation into disrepute, because there have been lies. There has been misleading behaviour. There has been a conspicuous lack of integrity. They are all spelt out in the course of events this week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So far as Ministers Habibie and Ginandjar are concerned, what are they? They are clearly on the record. On 18 June, there were no representations, no letters and no discussions with any minister. Then we find on 24 <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2806"> June the concession that no matters were raised with me after 16 May, deliberately designed to conceal the fact for as long as it could be concealed&mdash;but the truth eventually came out, as it always does&mdash;that, in fact, there had been these discussions. There had been these very significant representations made by two enormously significant economic development ministers in Indonesia before that artificially chosen date of 16 May&mdash;in fact, back in April when the foreign minister was in Indonesia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we had the second lie, misrepresentation, deceit&mdash;whatever you choose to call it; the statement that `no-one had raised with me, was writing me letters or was doing anything else after 18 June'. The date was set in a way to deliberately mislead by spelling out the date of 18 June as the only relevant date up to which relevant considerations apply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then, of course, we had the truth emerge again&mdash;as it always does&mdash;that after 18 June there was a further letter received from, again, this particular Indonesian minister. We had a further dose of the truth revealed today in a spectacular fashion that, in fact, the knowledge of the existence of that letter was strongly evident before 18 June, compounding the felony that had already been developed over that previous course of the last few days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the things that have stuck in the craw of our regional neighbours. These are ministers of great stature, great standing in their country, and they are treated as if their representations are of no account. They are forgotten. They are figments of the minister's imagination. The truth as it applies has to be dragged out of him, inch by inch, centimetre by centimetre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we had the saga so far as the Chinese minister was concerned. He was misleading this parliament about the representations coming from the Chinese minister Wu Yi. There was a pathetic attempt to slip and slide around that by saying, `No, it wasn't really a ministerial representation. It was really a representation made by a vice minister on that particular minister's behalf.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Then we have the further pathetic denial that there was no misleading in the content of the actual reply made to that particular Chi nese minister, when the stated reason for the cancellation of DIFF was said to be the budgetary problems that the government faces&mdash;or alleges that it faces or claims that it faces&mdash;rather than the truth of the matter being, as we all know, that this was a cavalier decision taken thoughtlessly, stupidly and over&hyphen;quickly without any regard to the consequences back in February, before the election in March, as a way of paying for the pork-barrelling that this election was all about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of this obvious misleading deceit is there in the text of the letter, written on the minister's signature to a Chinese minister. These things do not go unnoticed. These things are characterised, analysed, understood and perceived as examples of half&hyphen;truths, misleading behaviour, forms of deceit that are simply unacceptable in this, our region, or in any other conduct of international affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there is the question of breaking agreements solemnly entered into. I am not sure that people yet fully understand just how this DIFF process works. What happens is the DIFF projects are the subject of agreed bilateral negotiations, which are the subject of Australian ministers signing off on both before and after they take place. An agreed list of projects is finalised and agreed at officials levels, signed off by ministers. It is on the basis of that that letters of advice are then sent out to the relevant Australian companies. That process involves, so far as every participant in it is concerned, a clear understanding of a solemn international commitment entered into between governments to keep these projects alive to set them afloat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have here is a situation where 50 projects, as I understand it, that have reached that particular stage of letters of advice being sent have now been scuffled at a cost to the economy of some $1 billion and at an even larger cost to the credibility of Australia. Eighteen of them are in China; 16 of them are in Indonesia, I think; seven of them are in the Philippines&mdash;the three countries who have now unequivocally made clear their disgust with this particular decision making process, this particular breach of faith, this particular breach of agreements by this particular Australian foreign minister.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2807">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another major sin in international affairs, and that is to act in a way which demeans or humiliates or puts down or otherwise means your colleagues or counterparts are losing face. Again, we have had a spectacular series of examples of that particular breach of international good faith in the behaviour of the minister claiming, as he does, that no representations have been made to him when manifestly they have been by Minister Habibie and by Dr Ginandjar on behalf of Fidel Ramos, the President of the Philippines; by the ambassador on behalf of Madam Wu Yi, the Chinese minister, by her vice minister; by the secretary of agriculture, we discovered today, from the Philippines; and from God knows who else that we have not yet found out about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For these series of representations made at these levels in this solemn and deliberate way by people of this stature seeking to communicate this kind of message to the Australian government, for these things to be dismissed as meaningless and of no account&mdash;not the sort of thing that any person could be reasonably expected to remember; things that it is possible to lie or tell half&hyphen;truths about and duck and weave about&mdash;this kind of behaviour is seen for exactly what it is in the region: as disgraceful behaviour for anyone who claims to be the foreign minister of a respected country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not only a matter of these various dimensions of his behaviour as foreign minister. It is a matter of his propriety to Australians and his colleagues in this particular chamber. The standards of ministerial propriety that have been articulated by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) make it clear: `Ministers must be honest in their public dealings and should not intentionally mislead the parliament or the public.' The public is, understandably, crucial&mdash;a very important part of the whole process&mdash;but what have we got in the public statements made by the minister outside this parliament?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have got the grotesque misrepresentations in this article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> earlier this week&mdash;utterly, deliberately, blatantly misleading the Australian public as to the reasons for the abolition of the DIFF project. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> It is a statement which is, again, of extreme significance because, if there is a budgetary problem, obviously there is a totally different sort of a case to be made for the cancellation of expenditure of this kind that would be the case if it is simply an order to pay for some sleazy, pre&hyphen;election pork&hyphen;barrelling. So that misleading perpetrated on the Chinese, perpetrated on the Australian public, is another ground for this censure motion today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, no sin in this place could possibly be more important, as all sides of politics have traditionally acknowledged, than misleading this particular parliament. No sin could be more clearly established than was the case here. We have had sin in the form of direct misstatements back on 18 June about not one letter, when a letter was known to exist; and statements made in the form of failures to acknowledge the possibility that something occurred outside particular artificially defined dates which are designed very specifically to convey an impression of the truth which is very different from that which was, in fact, the case&mdash;the utterly artificial identification of 18 June and May as the relevant dates, ignoring what happened before and what happened afterwards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had use of language which slips and slides, which is not merely loose but which is positively debilitating to the English language in the way it has been assaulted in its deliberate lack of precision, designed to do no more than systematically mislead this parliament and avoid the possibility of further embarrassment to this beleaguered and thoroughly deservedly embarrassed minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The penalty for this misleading of parliament is strong and it is time honoured. It is not a matter of slap and tickle, it is not a matter of giggle, it is not a matter of voting down a censure by using the weight of parliamentary numbers, as we will undoubtedly see again today. It is, rather, a matter of upholding the integrity of our most fundamental democratic institution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The responsibility here is not just that of the government parties. We cannot expect much from this raggle&hyphen;taggle lot opposite in terms of understanding or appreciating the magnitude of the issues that are involved. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2808"> What it is all about, ultimately, is not the numbers in this place; it is about the responsibility and the sense of responsibility of the individuals concerned. In particular, it is about the responsibility of the leader of the government, the Prime Minister, John Howard, who has come into this place today embracing his minister, making absolutely clear his confidence in him, embracing everything he said on the public record, justifying it, defending it and doing nothing to put it in any context that would indicate serious regret or even the beginnings of an understanding of the scale of the damage that has been done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said outside this chamber today that if I, in the eight years that I had been Australia's Foreign Minister, had displayed one element of the lack of competence, the lack of judgment and the lack of integrity that have been demonstrated over the last few days by this minister, the present Foreign Minister, both Bob Hawke and Paul Keating, my prime ministers, would have had my guts for garters. Any leader worth his salt in this parliament would do the same thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John Howard made character, integrity and the reinforcement of parliamentary tradition&mdash;in particular, the integrity of the parliamentary process&mdash;an absolutely crucial element in his re&hyphen;election campaign. He has been mouthing off about standards ever since he walked into this place after the election. But unless he now puts his money where his mouth is, unless he honours his rhetoric, unless he lives up to those standards, unless he acts now to demand the resignation of Alexander Downer, he will demean not only himself but this institution. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Richardson did, but the present Deputy Leader of the Opposition did not. The reason I make that point is that I have here a bit of paper which is pretty relevant to the matter. Senator Richardson, in a press release dated 28 April 1992, stated that he had telephoned the President of the Marshall Islands, Mr Amata Kabua, on 6 April, asking that Mr Symons be allowed to return to Australia to prepare his defence&mdash;part of the core reason for the Richardson resignation. Senator Richardson said&mdash;and I quote:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . he had first checked the propriety of making such a call with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, and had made the call in a private capacity.</PARA>
<PARA>Let us see who should in fact `fess up' with regard to resignations, because this shadow minister never came out of the woodwork in relation to this matter. It is very timely to remind the House of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand the pressure which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is under, because he has the Manager of Opposition Business, Mr Crean, temporarily absent from the House, breathing down his neck at every moment. The caucus happily knows you made a mistake with regard to that ballot and that Mr Crean, as Manager of Opposition Business, is finding his feet in respect of being in opposition a whole lot better than the elaborately transformed Senator Gary Evans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That leads me to another point. During his long period as Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition had more agendas running than what might have been in the national interest. There was a phase when clearly the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was more interested in a job with the United Nations than he was in the pursuit of Australia's foreign policy interests.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a matter of public record that it came through at the eleventh hour. It is a matter of public record that he was on his way back to the airport when he finally got his meeting with President Fidel Castro. I make the point: that visit had a lot more to do with the ambitions of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for the United Nations than it did with the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say very clearly that the Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) of this day has made very substantial progress in getting foreign policy relations with key countries, including Malaysia, back on the rails and&mdash;not just in respect of his initiative to move ahead since the elections&mdash;has facilitated meetings in Brisbane which were not only with the Malaysian Prime Minister, Dr Mahathir, but also with other ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Foreign Affairs also created the framework which led to the Malaysian trade minister, Rafidah, returning to Australia just two weeks ago and coming to Canberra for a series of joint ministerial meetings and which subsequently led, as a consequence of the contribution made by <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Minister Downer, to an agreement being reached between me, as the Minister for Trade, and the Malaysian trade minister, Rafidah&mdash;a redoubtable and dynamic lady, not always the easiest person to negotiate with&mdash;resulting in the modernisation of the trade agreements which exist between Australia and Malaysia. You may be dismissive of that particular breakthrough; I am not. That is a powerful example of what the foreign and trade policy deliberations are achieving for Australia in a very reasonable and sensible way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has also discussed and finalised with me the issue of the appointment of an ambassador to APEC to build up our individual action plans to meet the APEC requirements. He has also put real momentum into our regional relations, especially in the APEC context. The minister has been to Japan and has led the way in building a very strong bilateral relationship between the new coalition government and the government of Japan. I do not have to remind the House that Japan is Australia's largest trading partner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the context of all that, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the member for Mayo, came back into this House this day and made a very substantial statement. I want to reiterate to the House that, in terms of this motion, the minister, about two hours ago, said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This incident has arisen because of loose use of language by me in the environment of question time. It is important that everything in this matter is set before the House and I regret that this has not been handled more expeditiously.</PARA>
<PARA>What could be more clear-cut than the approach by the minister? None of your failed ministers ever came through with a clear&hyphen;cut statement on the floor of the House. It was, of course, in totally different circumstances. That is why I am very happy to defend the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me now deal with the matter of DIFF in some detail. Members might like to know that it is eight per cent of Australia's aid program for this financial year. Some members in the gallery might like to think this is 50, 60 or 70 per cent of the Australian aid program. It is just eight per cent of the aid program&mdash;an important eight per cent. Some <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2810"> elements are continuing into the next financial year, as has been pointed out by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the member for Wentworth (Mr Andrew Thomson), and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also interesting to see what some key people have had to say about the DIFF program over the years. I refer to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daybreak</EMPHASIS> program when the Chairperson of Community Aid Abroad, Dr Judy Henderson, said that `the commercialisation of the aid program' was represented by DIFF. To quote further, Dr Henderson said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is the export subsidy program for Australian industry which actually subsidises Australian industry to tender for contracts. That subsidy is through the aid program . . . It shouldn't be in the aid program.</PARA>
<PARA>The Executive Director of ACFOA, Mr Russell Rollason, not someone known for his support of one side of politics or the other but someone of great note in aid issues over the years, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DIFF is primarily aid to Australian industry, not to the poor of the Third World.</PARA>
<PARA>Members on both sides might like to listen to this quote from Mr Rollason:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DIFF distorts Australia's geographical priorities for the aid program. The basic motivation behind the DIFF scheme is commercial, not development.</PARA>
<PARA>These are quotes of some note from Russell Rollason. It is a matter of record that the government and the minister have moved quickly to appoint Paul Simons, the former executive chairman of Woolworths, to carry out an investigation and assessment of the aid program priorities. I welcome this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to the DIFF program, more specifically, if you are about continuing with $90 million plus of extra DIFF expenditure, as it would seem the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition would argue, you have to look at what else goes out of the program. Is that aid for HIV programs for men, women and children in Africa&mdash;they are important programs and I do not want to see those wiped out&mdash;aid to victims of flood and famine and aid to prevent children dying from malaria, measles and diarrhoea in Papua New Guinea? <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> In other words, you have to strike a balance with regard to our aid priorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is prepared to make the tough decisions. This Minister for Foreign Affairs is prepared to make the tough decisions. This minister is honest enough to come into the House and deal with these matters when they are raised. The amount of paper which has flowed across my desk in the first three months of government, I concede, exceeds my expectations; it is quite massive. You look for the snowing and you turn them around pretty quickly. The member for Rankin (Mr Beddall) is not without some merit on that point, because he was comprehensively snowed on the issue of woodchips at every single stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has made it very clear to the House that he has had representations from various levels. I say very clearly that I too have had representations from various levels on the question of the DIFF policy. What is exceptional about that? This was announced earlier this year in the election build&hyphen;up. It was made very public at that time. Embassies worth their salt would have reported that in their cables and reports on the election back to their home governments. It is quite reasonable that they should then have made further representations. They have been alluded to in summary cables from the Philippines and from elsewhere. These cables make it clear. I accept a degree of disagreement with regard to this policy decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say again that it should be considered in the context of the totality of our bilateral relations, be it with Australia and Indonesia, Australia and the Philippines or Australia and other Asian countries. When you consider it that way, you will see a different picture altogether. On that same visit to the Philippines, I was very happy to announce a very important aid project of $6&half; million, an FMD aid project, which was warmly welcomed by the ministers of the Philippines government and has led to further progress being made indirectly on a range of bilateral negotiations between me and the primary industries portfolio area and between me and government ministers at all levels within the Philippines government that I have had contact with.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2811">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is about the good management of our bilateral relations. We are off to a flying start with regard to that and we can thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) for that flying start, which has got Malaysian relations back on the rails, built a lot of confidence into a range of other relations, and&mdash;much as you do not like it&mdash;we are going to continue down this path and we are going to show what a mess 13 years of Labor made, with all your resignations during that particular period, in terms of the real outcome of foreign affairs and trade for Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, what agony. At least you have got to say about the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) that he did not have the gall to come in here and try to defend the indefensible, because Alexander Downer's position is indefensible. Everyone in this House that knows anything about the forms of this place acknowledges that point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By any standards, today's statement when he came back into this place at 1.30 this afternoon, giving us five minutes notice, should have been a resignation speech. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) made you come into the House and give that statement because nothing that would have resulted from your own approach could have led with any confidence to our believing you had come in of your own volition and done it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have not only misled this parliament&mdash;I should direct these comments through the chair to the foreign minister&mdash;as acknowledged by the Prime Minister this afternoon; the foreign minister has also shown himself not to be across his portfolio and as having jeopardised significant trade and aid opportunities in the region. What more damage can a person do, you have got to ask yourself. And yet he comes into this place, effectively saying he has done nothing wrong, giving a limp apology to the parliament and hoping that it will go away. Well, this will not go away. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most serious offence that can be carried out in this parliament is to mislead it. When you have got the opportunity to join an executive of the Commonwealth government in this country and have charge of a portfolio, you are expected to be across it, you are expected to advance Australia's interests, not set them back. And that is what you have done. And it is against all of those measures that your resignation should have been appended to the speech you came into the parliament with today at 1.30.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that before today's statement of the foreign minister there was a general view among the press gallery that was observing this that you had not technically misled the parliament. There was a general view that you were incompetent, you were not reading your material, you were too loose with your words and, by any other standards, you should go, in particular bearing in mind the Prime Minister's standards, saying he wants performance out of his ministers&mdash;but I will come to that in a minute. The press gallery effectively saw you as not having technically misled, but today your statement to this parliament blew that notion out of the water because what you did was come into the parliament and say that you knew of the Habibie letter before 18 June.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You said in your statement today in the parliament that you knew of the Habibie letter before 18 June. What is the significance of 18 June? That is the day you got up in this parliament for the first time to deny that any minister had raised this issue with you. Remember what you said? `Not one minister has raised it with me'. Well, we already know that there are eight who have raised it and we are still going to find out how many more, but is that what you really meant by `not one'? Do you treat us as fools?

Sure, it is not one, but the fact of the matter is that you have misled the parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You knew of the Habibie letter before 18 June. You knew of it before any statement to this parliament. So that technical defence that you have not misled the parliament is simply washed away; it has disappeared. Against the background of your having been found to have misled and the Prime Minister acknowledging that you have misled, you have got no other honourable action but to resign. And that is what should have been appended to your statement in the parliament today at 1.30 p.m.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 18 June you had great play in this parliament. You see yourself as some great raconteur at the dispatch box. You see yourself as the person giving solidarity, support and leadership. We know that you cannot lead because they got rid of you a couple of years ago. You came into this parliament thinking that by answering a question in an offensive way to the shadow minister for foreign affairs you could just skate through this and ridicule us in the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did you come in and say? You said that not one minister had raised this with you and you asked whether it was so important that they had not raised it with you, whether that was the logic. This is you taunting us with rhetorical questions in the parliament. You went on to say that they would be writing you letters if they were concerned, knowing full well that they had written you letters. You knew that. Yet you came into this parliament and deliberately said that no-one had raised concerns. It is shameful. Shame on you! You have no course but to resign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But you then compounded the problem. What we then had was the statement of 24 June. You slunk back into the parliament at 8.30 at night. There was no notice of this. I do not think that even the shadow foreign minister had been told of your attendance in this parliament. You thought that you could get on the record some correction that would save face and get you out of the trouble.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did you do? You came into the parliament and said `so that the record is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> complete'. That was Monday of this week. Yet today we have additions to it. The record is certainly more complete today than it was on Monday, but you had us believe on Monday that the record was complete. On Monday you said that it was complete. In that statement of 24 June you went on to say, `I have had records checked back to 11 March'&mdash;checked back from 24 June, when you made the statement&mdash;to 11 March. There was still no mention of the Minister Habibie letter. What a disgrace!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You thought that you could come into this place and continue to avoid what you knew you had misled the parliament about from 18 June. That is misleading by any standard. But the difference is that the new Howard government has so-called higher standards. The Prime Minister made great play during the last election campaign of lifting standards and ensuring that there was more supremacy of parliament over the executive; that there was more accountability; and that the parliament was a more open forum so that ministers could be held accountable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the day the parliament reconvened, he tabled a ministerial code of conduct in the parliament. I will quote the section to the foreign minister so that he can mull over this, too, in deciding what is the honourable thing to do. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ministers must be honest in their public dealings and should not intentionally mislead the parliament or the public.</PARA>
<PARA>We see the foreign minister departing the scene at the moment. I want him to listen to this. The code of conduct went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any misconception caused inadvertently should be corrected at the earliest opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA>He has at least given you the defence that you inadvertently misled the parliament. But what is the requirement on you if you have inadvertently misled? It is to correct the matter at the earliest possible opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You had this letter on 18 June&mdash;certainly before 18 June, but we are not sure when. That was eight days ago and five parliamentary sitting days ago. But you had not taken one opportunity until 1.30 this afternoon to correct it. Why did you correct it? It was because of the constant barrage of attacks <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2813"> over the last two days and because the Prime Minister forced you to. Let there be no mistake about that. I want to know for how long the Prime Minister has guaranteed your existence in that job on the basis of what you have said today. The fact is that you should have tendered your resignation with the statement on the 18th.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a look at the opportunities the minister had to correct his statement. First of all, he should not have given the flippant response on 18 June, because it was wrong. He misled the parliament on that day. The second opportunity that he was given to retract was in question time on Monday of this week. The third opportunity was on the night of the first Monday of this week, 24 June, when he came into this House and said that he wanted to complete the record. But he did not complete the record. What is worse, he knew that he had not completed it. By his own admission today, he had had the letter and made no mention of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As if to compound the problem even further, in response to the very first question that was asked of him in question time on Tuesday, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I gave an undertaking to the House during my answer to questions yesterday and during the censure debate that I would check the records in my department on this matter and was quite happy to come back to the House . . . and I indeed did that. Frankly, Mr Speaker, I have nothing else to add.</PARA>
<PARA>So he had four opportunities up until the start of question time yesterday to correct it. At that point the Habibie letter was not public knowledge. It became public knowledge later in the day, at about 5 o'clock. Yet he took not one opportunity to come into this House and correct the record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know this because we were in here debating the export market development grants scheme and had a full house at 10 o'clock last night, when a division was called on that scheme. The minister was slinking back on the other side of the chamber, voting against our amendments to this proposition. He had the opportunity last night to correct the record but said nothing. Today, as we all know, the sitting of parliament commenced at <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 9.30 in the morning. He could have come into the House and corrected it then.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He thought that he could get away with it again. He thought that because he had got away with it four times he may as well chance his arm again. At least the Prime Minister and the rest of his cabinet colleagues were not that stupid. They had to twist his arm to make the statement he made before this House at 1.30 p.m. today. That continues to show how much the foreign minister has misled this parliament, has continued to mislead it and has continued to compound the issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What he has tried to do is to pretend in this parliament that you can just have a slip of the tongue; that you can be a bit careless with your words and you should not be hung for it. That might be right in some people's view, but you cannot do it four times. As soon as it is drawn to your attention, you should have the decency to come into the place and apologise. What do you mean by improving parliamentary standards if you think you can get away with misleading the parliament and the issue will just slip away? It is a shameful approach to be taking on behalf of the people that elected you. It is a shameful approach in terms of this institution and the reputation that we try to build around it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one other point that I want to go to, and that is this question of the DIFF scheme itself. The foreign minister tries to make out that this is not an important scheme. It is. It is not the only scheme that we say is important for our aid and trade, but it is a vitally important one. The decision that has been taken by the coalition government to cut this scheme&mdash;despite the fact that they promised in the election to keep it&mdash;has already cost $1 billion in investment opportunity to this country and 1,500 direct jobs. Yet they masquerade on the basis of being a party that will get investment going and get job activity. One billion dollars and 1,500 jobs!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me go to the point of the minister saying he prefers aid to trade. The point I want to make is that, in the Habibie letter, it is both. What scheme has been cut out there? It is the electrification project intending to electrify one million households in remote <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2814"> areas. That is of benefit not only to the Indonesians who do not have electricity&mdash;what else is aid about if it is not giving them the standards that we take for granted?&mdash;but also to Australian industry through investment and jobs. Yet you have jeopardised it. You are trying to pretend that these are mickey mouse schemes&mdash;that they do not really matter&mdash;and that you would prefer to do aid rather than trade. But you are fooled, because you can do both with this. You have put the very thing at risk. It is for that reason you should be censured but, more importantly, you should resign. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No amount of yelling and screaming by the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) and those who spoke before him on the opposition side will disguise the fact that their comments are repetitive and irrelevant. They have added nothing new to the matter before the House. In fact, it is almost possible in passing to have a degree of sympathy for the Labor Party. This censure motion has been rendered entirely irrelevant and a waste of the time of this parliament by the statement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) earlier today. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has advised the House that he inadvertently misled the House through the use of loose language, for which he has expressed his regret. That is the beginning and the end of the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They woke up this morning and thought, `How do we keep this alive? We can shout, we can hector, we can exaggerate. We can make life more difficult for members of the government.' And then, of course, they find that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in total discharge of his obligations to the House and in full compliance with the requirements of ministerial conduct of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), has undercut the ground from them entirely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple fact is that there was no need for this censure motion. I have been in this place for 13 years and I have seen some pretty lame censure motions, but the one today ranks up there amongst the worst of them. This is an entirely concocted and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> artificial charge being levelled at the Minister for Foreign Affairs. If you were sincere and if you were decent you would have accepted the statement as delivered at 1.30 p.m. and the answers given to you during question time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, leaving all that aside, the real crime of the censure motion before us at the moment is that it is directed at the wrong person. It should be a censure of the shadow minister for foreign affairs, the honourable member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith (Mr Brereton). And why? Because he has jeopardised&mdash;even endangered&mdash;this nation's relationship with the Chinese government for the simple reason that in the parliament he accused, openly and on two occasions, the Chinese embassy of leaking confidential correspondence between it and the Minister for Foreign Affairs. On page 2555 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 24 June, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Can I conclude by asking: what is the minister's response to the fact that the letters exchanged between the minister and the vice&hyphen;minister of the Chinese ministry of foreign trade and economic cooperation concerning DIFF were actually leaked from the Chinese embassy in Canberra on the day after your answer last Tuesday? Doesn't that fact demonstrate that the contemptuous dismissal of the serious concerns of the Chinese government has actually caused great damage to our bilateral relations&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>all the rhetoric&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">damage which prompted the Chinese embassy to take action when you lied to this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is little wonder that the Chinese government was enraged . . .  So enraged were they that within 24 hours they had taken action . . . </PARA>
<PARA>You can pretend that this is a matter which is, as the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans) said, reverberating around the capitals of the world and that this is a matter on the tip of every diplomat's tongue throughout the world. But the fact is that what will register more with missions&mdash;whether it be in Australia or in other countries&mdash;is the fact that the person pertaining to be the next Minister for Foreign Affairs has accused officials within the Chinese embassy of leaking confidential information and, moreover, did it in the most public forum available to any citizen of this country.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2815">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the Chinese response was quick and was angry. Within 24 hours, the councillor at the Chinese embassy had contacted the Department of Foreign Affairs, on behalf of the ambassador, and repudiated entirely the charge&mdash;that cowardly charge&mdash;levelled against the Chinese embassy. So no more cant or hypocrisy from your side about the dimensions of this issue. You have elevated it to a very serious national issue by your attacks on the Chinese embassy. What would you expect from the shadow minister for foreign affairs? I will not, however much it tempts me, relay for the information of members&mdash;particularly new members&mdash;his track record in this place and, more particularly, in the New South Wales parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will simply quote Mr McKinnon, the New Zealand foreign affairs minister when he said on 10 February last year that the actions of the then Minister for Transport, the now shadow minister for foreign affairs, had brought relations between our two countries `to an all time low'. That is his skill at international relations. They are his credentials to aspire to the office of Minister for Foreign Affairs. That is why when he was appointed journalists burst out laughing in front of Kim Beazley when he announced that Laurie Brereton would be the shadow minister for foreign affairs. The next morning it led to an exchange on ABC radio between the broadcasters Peter Thompson and Pru Goward. Peter Thompson asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, what about Laurie Brereton going to Foreign Affairs; and were journalists chuckling at this yesterday. . . What made them chuckle?</PARA>
<PARA>Pru Goward replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, I think because Laurie Brereton is not the picture of a diplomat.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course he has proven that in his short time as shadow minister for foreign affairs. Let us put aside his background and give him a chance to establish new credentials to aspire to high office in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even when he is given the benefit of the doubt on his appointment, look what he has done since. He has made only two contributions as shadow minister. The first was to politicise the Gillespie children. What was Mrs Gillespie's response? She found his <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> comments nauseating. That is what she thinks. Those members who were in here earlier were listening to the member for Holt, the former Minister for Foreign Affairs. For some reason he labelled the charge against the Minister for Foreign Affairs of bungling the Gillespie episode. How remarkable! This is what Mrs Gillespie said on 25 March this year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Gareth Evans wouldn't even speak to me on the phone. He spoke to me once when my daughter was burnt and then I had to promise I wouldn't tell the media, that I wouldn't discuss it because it would make him look bad.</PARA>
<PARA>Gareth Evans used to say about her problems:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . well, that's too bad. He wasn't going to get involved. I find it quite astonishing. I just caught the Channel Ten five o'clock bulletin, and I find it quite astonishing and quite nauseating that Laurie Brereton, the new Shadow Foreign Affairs Minister for Labor . . . is coming out and demanding some sort of inquiry . . . wanting a full report from the Government on the Gillespie children.</PARA>
<PARA>That was Mrs Gillespie on 2GB radio. What is the purpose of this censure motion? What people have forgotten is that this House censured the shadow minister for foreign affairs just yesterday. He has no credentials and no standing at all with which to charge or attack members of this government, let alone his opposite number. Honourable members must listen when the member for Holt speaks and they will notice the unbroken sentences that go for three minutes without a full stop. If they can tolerate his `garrulous Gary' style, he did say this in the most sanctimonious voice possible, `Well, if I had made the same errors as the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Paul Keating would have had my guts for garters.' Good Lord!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">`Gareth's greatest gaffes' is the headline in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> dated 8 July 1995 and they run through the very serious fundamental errors of judgment he made as Minister for Foreign Affairs in the last 12 months or so. This will jog quite a few memories. It is sad how quickly we forget. Once they are relegated to the opposition and are so rejected and despised by the Australian people, one does tend to forget them and cast their record of government into the wastepaper bin of history.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2816">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do honourable members remember in April 1995 how he fumbled the complaints of the former ASIS officers and agents who went on TV? He could not or would not act on their complaints, even though they had been brought to his attention and that of his department many times over. He did nothing at all so they had to go public and of course compensation has been paid out as a result. Do members remember in May 1995 when the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> wanted to publish some details relating to telephone interceptions involving embassies here in Canberra? Gareth Evans response was that he wanted to gaol journalists. Do members remember how that went on for weeks and weeks? The great civil libertarian of Melbourne University in his younger days wanted to gaol journalists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In June 1995 do members remember how he underestimated Australian public opinion in regard to French nuclear testing in the Pacific? How he completely and utterly failed to represent the interests of this country. He was so out of touch that he was unable to summon up even a skerrick of courage or determination to try to deter French nuclear testing, and didn't it cost them politically! He has been brought to the lower house as a leadership aspirant, a man of his judgment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In July 1995 he failed to anticipate the backlash over the appointment of General Mantiri as Indonesia's ambassador to Australia. Then, as the Indonesians know only too well, he sought to undermine General Mantiri to stop him ever coming to Australia. If Paul Keating had any standards or respect for this institution or his responsibilities as the former Prime Minister, he would have had his guts for garters. But who would ever have relied on Paul Keating or the former Labor government for enforcing standards? If any member of the Labor Party thinks we are going to be lectured about parliamentary standards, they have got another thought coming. We have elevated parliamentary standards to a new level and it is a level they do not like and one they will never meet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Year after year the Labor Party had minister after minister on this front bench who were blatantly incompetent and failed to discharge their responsibilities in this place. Above all <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that, the Minister for Foreign Affairs has had an excellent start to his portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member wants to wave press clippings around. The honourable member can wave one Indonesian newspaper, and I will come to foreign newspapers. Let us have a look at this collection: `An impressive beginning' in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> by Lindsay Murdoch; `How Downer engineered a diplomatic coup' in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> by Greg Sheridan, no less; `Downer scores a quick coup' in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>; `Mahathir talks coup for Howard'; `Dr Mahathir a prize catch for the Coalition'; `Mahathir to see Downer'; `Downer passes easy first assignment'; `Mr Downer's Asia priority' which was praised in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> editorial; `Jakarta welcomes Downer in style', Patrick Walters in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>; and `Flynn return a coup for Downer'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the member for Holt was speaking for some reason about the Minister for Foreign Affairs' failings in regard to the Gillespie case, he spoke also about his failings in the Flynn case. Ask Dr Flynn what he thinks about his treatment under the administration of the member for Holt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">`Downer's Asian debut' was the headline in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of an editorial praising him. Another headline was `Downer assigns Asia top priority'. It goes on and on. Moreover, there are a whole number of international newspapers as well, including Indonesian newspapers. A headline in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Indonesian Observer</EMPHASIS> on 17 April was `Suharto hails Australia's commitment to Asia'. On 17 April 1996, the headline read `Downer and his constructive policy'. A headline in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Jakarta Post</EMPHASIS> on 17 April was `RI endorses Australia's UN Security Council bid'. On 16 April 1996, `Canberra vows constructive diplomacy on RI' was the headline. There were also articles in papers in Singapore and Thailand. This is too embarrassing. I will not embarrass the Minister for Foreign Affairs any longer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have here a desperate opposition. With the arrival of the member for Blaxland (Mr Hatton), I notice members of the opposition have spread themselves out into a new compartment of the chamber when they could actually fill up the whole back row. Have you <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2817"> noticed that? Have you noticed there are actually eight seats in the back row that will accommodate your six or seven over there? Why do you not want to be all together? Is it because you have been reduced to a pitiful rump in this parliament and, therefore, of course, will exaggerate and beat up anything that may come from our side?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This minister has regretted an inadvertent misleading of the parliament. You cannot, whatever verbal dexterity you have, string it along any further. Why do you not all get together so we and the people in the gallery can see the opinion the Australian public have of you? The Minister for Foreign Affairs enjoys the confidence of this government. He has completely and honourably discharged his responsibilities in this House in a way that is utterly unknown and foreign to members of the Labor Party.</PARA>

He adverted to a situation about miners in Mount Isa who had suffered high levels of lead in their blood. He turned to address members of the opposition and said words to the effect `The opposition spokesman should not laugh. These are serious matters'. I was not in the chamber at the time. I have spoken to the member for Kennedy and he accepts that it was an honest slip.

<PARA>This bill proposes an amendment to the Australian Capital Territory Government Service (Consequential Provisions) Act 1994. That amendment will enable the extension of staff mobility arrangements between the ACT Government Service and the Australian Public Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1994 when officers of the Australian Public Service were compulsorily transferred to the ACT Government Service, the provisions of the Australian Capital Territory Government Service (Consequential Provisions) Act 1994, the ACTGS act, were introduced to allow ACT officers to apply for selection on merit for positions advertised in the gazette as vacancies in the Australian Public Service. Similar provisions are provided in ACT legislation for Australian Public Service officers to apply for ACT vacancies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In July 1995 the ACT Government corporatised the ACT Electricity and Water Authority, ACTEW. This had the effect of removing the mobility rights which ACTEW employees previously held as ACT officers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following a request by the ACT government and advice that the ACT government is considering corporatising further authorities, this bill proposes an amendment to the Australian Capital Territory Government Service (Consequential Provisions) Act 1994 to insert a regulation making power in the act which will enable the mobility rights of former ACT officers to be continued in an appropriate way consistent with overall Commonwealth policy <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2820"> on corporatisation and contracting out.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this bill and the bills that have been introduced before it is essentially to direct funds from the relevant levying arrangements for each of those industries to the Australian Animal Health Council Ltd.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will allow the pork industry in this case, and in the case of the previous bills the relevant agricultural industries, to meet their funding obligations to the council.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the bills to honourable members. I also commend to all honourable members the Australian Animal Health Council, both on account of its coming into being and also its continued and important role in Australia's livestock industries in particular. The council has been set up to meet some key needs and to address considerations of great importance. I would like to touch on those briefly. Firstly, it is relevant to point out that there are eight separate animal health services in Australia, each with some unique features, but with a significant amount of overlap, thus creating a situation in which it makes a lot of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sense to rationalise and pull together those areas that can best and more efficiently be addressed by one body.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth noting that there has been a significant reduction in resources available to animal health services in most states and territories. I sound a warning that this process must not be allowed to continue unabated. The winding back of everything from field staff through to veterinary laboratories and so forth around the country may very well cost us dearly one day. Very careful evaluation needs to be made by all governments of the effectiveness of such services as are retained. Such services as are considered for rationalisation ought to be very carefully evaluated in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that there is a need for a national approach to deal with animal health services to ensure coordination, cooperation and consistent policy and service delivery. This is especially so in an age when, for example, livestock are regularly moved from one state to another and in an age when, increasingly, those consumers of our product, who are to be found in foreign lands&mdash;those countries that take our exports&mdash;expect to be able to deal with us as a nation rather than on a state by state basis. For example, in the case of a problem with residue, as we have seen a couple of times in Australia's meat industries, there needs to be a capacity to handle the situation on a nationally coordinated basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the past there has been a lack of industry involvement in policy development and in financial management involving animal health services. It always makes sense to have involved in the processes that affect those industries both those who, on the one hand, are most directly involved&mdash;who have the expertise&mdash;and those who, on the other hand, have the incentive to get it right. There is a need to establish efficient, adequate and durable resourcing arrangements for animal health services. That goes to the heart of achieving the greatest possible cost efficiencies. That is important not only from the point of view of the taxpayer, who obviously does not want to be funding duplication, but also from the point of view of industry which wants to minimise costs in terms of levies that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2822"> might be raised to achieve objectives relating both to the common good of an industry and to the potential financial impact of things going seriously wrong in any of our livestock industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to ensure that we avoid any underutilisation of private veterinary services in the public domain. I think that has been a feature of animal health regulatory arrangements in the past. We need to make realistic, sensible and commercially prudent use of private suppliers where we can in this area. We need to apply strategic direction to the animal health service industry, again, to avoid unnecessary duplication and to focus on a widespread basis our approach to difficult issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is the reality of the new GATT sanitary and phyto&hyphen;sanitary requirements. Touching on an issue which I raised earlier, they do require us to be able to respond on a national basis on behalf of any of our industries or in relation to questions of quality assurance, food hygiene and those sorts of things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also a growing consumer consciousness of the need for clean, healthy food. There is the question of our  facing, as a major agricultural exporter, specialised and increasingly sophisticated testing capacities in key markets. We need to be mindful of that. The best way for us to ensure that important markets remain open to us in a spirit of goodwill and willingness to expand trade opportunities is to ensure that we have in place quality assurance programs which really do work. I think the Australian Animal Health Council can play a major role in ensuring that, to use the jargon that is now so common in agricultural industries, we get it right from paddock through to plate, whether that plate is a domestic plate or a foreign plate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I think it is important that we are able to maintain close scrutiny of Australia's capacity both to deliver effective services to prove its animal health status and to meet specific requirements of major international markets. This is an ideal body to do that. I commend the industries involved for the way in which they have been able to coordinate their responses to the need and then to pull <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> together the package that is reflected in the legislation before us today.</PARA>

<PARA>This bill proposes changes to the Industry Research and Development Act 1986 which make the research and development tax concession a better value program for all Australians, both by stopping unintended use of the concession and by making the administrative procedures better suited to the needs of industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Access to the concession is to be confined to a reasonable period after the research and development activities have been conducted. This means that the tax concession program can return to its rightful focus of encouraging new research and new development rather than encouraging consultants to plough through years of company accounts looking for a tax sweetener for their clients. The scope of this gravedigging is so extensive that these measures are expected to result in revenue protection totalling $235 million over the next three financial years.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other improvements to the registration process, such as advance registration and registration of activities, also encourage companies to direct their creativity towards new technologies and markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also validates overseas research and development decisions and internal review decisions taken outside the mandatory time periods prescribed by the principal act. This <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2823"> validation is quarantined to the effect of the mandatory time period and will work to confirm the deductions of companies affected by these decisions. Amendments are also made to ensure that such invalid decisions are not taken again in future. These amendments are made without undermining the mechanisms built into the legislation to ensure that companies receive decisions in a timely fashion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of changes have been introduced to bring the administration of the research and development tax concession into line with the self&hyphen;assessment principles of taxation administration. These include reducing the obligations of the Industry Research and Development Board prior to registering a company and introducing the ability to set fees by regulation in relation to applications and requests to the board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill represents a huge boost to the integrity of the research and development tax concession, which is long overdue. I refer you to the explanatory memorandum to the bill for a fuller description of their changes and their necessity to the responsible administration of Commonwealth revenue.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The various provisions of the bill should be seen in the context of the government's commitment to quality, diversity and innovative change in the higher education sector. A number of amendments provide supplementation for price movements. This supplementation covers items such as superannuation <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> expenses, teaching hospitals, special capital projects, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander support funds, 1996 expenditure for grants to open learning organisations, and operating grants in respect of the years 1996, 1997 and 1998.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is committed to providing flexible funding for research projects in higher education institutions. To achieve this objective, amendments are to be made to subsection 23(1) of the act to broaden the range of research proposals that the minister may approve, including research training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendments to section 20A of the act will create a facility for providing advances of operating grants for a wide range of purposes. This will increase the overall flexibility of funding arrangements for higher education institutions. Subject to parliamentary scrutiny, the minister will be able to issue guidelines that will establish the overall amount to be paid as advances as well as the types of activities that will be funded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill provides for the streamlining of administrative procedures of the open learning deferred payment scheme. The concept of `semester' is replaced with `study periods' to reflect the structure of the open learning scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also makes amendments to subsection 106AA and subsection 106AB. Currently an open learning agency will process an application for the deferred payment scheme without the inclusion of the client's tax file number. The amendments will mean that clients will be ineligible for the deferred payment scheme if they do not provide a tax file number.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An amendment to section 106E broadens the current obligation of the agency to provide information to the minister to include statistical and other information relating to clients undertaking units of study. The amendment will result in the agency being subject to the same obligation as higher education institutions. These amendments will enhance the Commonwealth's ability to monitor the scheme's effectiveness and ensure proper accountability. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2824">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will provide funding to trial the development of an indigenous university network. The framework will include improved student support services, up to four indigenous teaching and research centres, an indigenous electronic network, and the development of open learning style educational packages for indigenous people in correctional institutions and other places with restricted access to higher education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other amendments to the act will remove the requirement for taxpayers to include the amount of HECS debt when lodging their income tax return. The Australian Taxation Office already has access to this information. It will update the definition of `qualified accountant' in section 3; and update tables A and B of section 4 of the act to accurately reflect current higher education institutions recognised for the purposes of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill reflects the government's commitment to a relevant, high quality education system which is striving for excellence and innovation in teaching and research. I commend the bill to the House and I present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>

<PARA>This bill amends the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Act 1990 to implement the government's election commitment to expand substantially the benefits available under the defence home owner scheme. The bill also makes corrections to the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government recognises that the dedicated service of defence men and women is a critical element in maintaining Australia's national security. The conditions of service <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for those men and women must be tailored not only to providing appropriate remuneration for their efforts but also to recognising the unique characteristics of defence service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The defence home owner scheme is established by the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Act. It is designed to meet the requirements of both the Defence Force and individual members. It offers an interest rate subsidy on home loans which is related to length of service, with the benefit being enhanced for members who provide operational service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The characteristics of Defence Force service&mdash;such as regular postings to different locations&mdash;make home ownership a particular challenge for our service personnel. The home owner scheme assists them to meet that challenge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition parties' defence election policy pledged enhancement of the benefits in the home owner scheme and its extension to eligible members of the reserves. This bill delivers on those policy pledges as it does on lowering the eligibility period from six years to five years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments to the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Act double the maximum amount of subsidised loans to $80,000, or $160,000 where spouses have a joint entitlement. This increase will be available for existing as well as new borrowers under the home owner scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of members rendering continuous full&hyphen;time service, the basic eligibility period for new borrowers is reduced from six to five years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The home owner scheme will also be extended to reservists&mdash;as was promised in our policy&mdash;who have completed a basic eligibility period of eight years of statutory training obligation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The remaining amendments made by the bill relate to references in the Defence Force Discipline Act. The Defence Force Discipline Act provides a code for the investigation and prosecution of service offences committed by members of the Defence Force. The act itself specifies some offences directly related to Defence Force service and deals with other <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2825"> more general offences, such as aggravated assault and burglary, by adopting the criminal law applying in the Jervis Bay territory. The law applying in the Jervis Bay territory is essentially the law of the Australian Capital Territory, which has included the New South Wales Crimes Act, as amended by laws of the Australian Capital Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1992, Australian Capital Territory legislation changed the status of the Crimes Act in force in the Australian Capital Territory&mdash;and which is therefore applied to the Jervis Bay territory&mdash;from an act of New South Wales to an act of the Australian Capital Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current references in the Defence Force Discipline Act to the Crimes Act of New South Wales in its application to the Jervis Bay territory therefore need to be replaced by references to the Crimes Act of the Australian Capital Territory in its application to the Jervis Bay territory. Failure to make the change could put at risk prosecutions based on Defence Force Discipline Act provisions adopting Crimes Act offences. The amendments to the Defence Force Discipline Act will correct these references from the date of commencement of the relevant Australian Capital Territory legislation. I commend the bill to the House and I now present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill contains a number of important bankruptcy reform measures. A similar bill was first introduced into this House by the former government in March last year&mdash;if I remember rightly, by the shadow minister who is at the table, the honourable member for Denison <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> (Mr Kerr). Before its introduction, extensive consultation was conducted by way of discussion papers circulated to interested professional and community groups.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Despite this consultation, concerns regarding certain provisions remained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill that I am introducing today will, I am confident, overcome the issues raised by, or on behalf of, many insolvency practitioners during debate on the 1995 bill. It also addresses other matters identified by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee in its majority report of September 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill retains many of the features of the 1995 bill with some important changes that will achieve a greater level of fairness, while also providing an appropriate balance between the aims of financially rehabilitating debtors and enabling proper levels of returns to be recovered for creditors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The concerns raised by practitioners regarding the definition of insolvency as proposed in the 1995 bill have been addressed. The bill now proposes that `insolvent' be defined in the same terms as that applying under Corporations Law. That is, a person is insolvent if he or she is unable to pay his or her debts as they become due and payable. I have also adopted suggestions that transferees should not be disadvantaged by the new provisions if a transfer is void against the trustee. Instead of the transferee merely proving in the bankruptcy, under the proposed changes a trustee will be required to pay to the transferee an amount equal to the value of any consideration that the transferee gave.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Changes are also proposed to the definition of income when assessing whether a bankrupt is liable to make a mandatory contribution to his or her estate. Among other things it will exclude payments of legal fees that are paid under special schemes designed to assist low income litigants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2826"> These are just a few of the changes that have come about as a result of consultation with practitioners. I recognise that professionals involved in the personal insolvency field have a lot to offer and obtaining their views will assist in the development of improved laws in this area. To this end, I have estab lished a new forum to achieve improved consultation on matters of interest to personal insolvency practitioners. It is planned that the consultative forum will meet twice each year. I have invited key organisations in the personal insolvency field to participate in discussing important matters for improving bankruptcy law and practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill as a whole will bring about major improvements to bankruptcy administration by streamlining procedures and processes for trustees, introducing a new form of insolvency arrangement, and tightening up antecedent transaction provisions, all of which I will discuss in a little more detail. I am confident this bill will lead to significant improvements to bankruptcy law and practice and further reforms will be possible through the cooperative efforts of all those involved in the personal insolvency system.</PARA>
<PARA>ADMINISTRATIVE ARRANGEMENTS</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">One Stop Service</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will create an extended service within the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia&mdash;ITSA. This will be achieved by the proposed abolition of the offices of Registrar and Deputy Registrar in Bankruptcy and the distribution of the functions performed by them among the Inspector-General in Bankruptcy, the Official Receivers, trustees and the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill is designed to ensure that most persons in financial difficulty will only have to deal with one agency in relation to bankruptcy and personal insolvency matters, rather than two, as at present. People who lodge debtor's petitions will benefit most from this change, although those involved in administrations resulting from creditors' petitions will also find that there has been a significant decrease in the paperwork and administrative red tape that will be required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At present, when a debtor presents a debtor's petition for bankruptcy, he or she must go to the Registrar's office in the Federal Court to complete a petition and a statement of affairs. When the petition is accepted, the debtor becomes a bankrupt. A file in relation to the bankruptcy is held by the Court. Under the proposed arrangements the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> debtor's petition will be lodged with ITSA and all records relating to any bankruptcy will be held in ITSA. If the bankruptcy is administered by ITSA, as 92 per cent of them are, then the debtor need go no further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill provides that ITSA will be responsible for providing information to all debtors who want to lodge a debtor's petition. It is envisaged that this information will cover such things as possible alternatives to bankruptcy, the effect of bankruptcy on their assets and income, as well as employment disqualifications associated with becoming a bankrupt. This information should enable debtors to give more careful consideration to whether bankruptcy is really appropriate or whether it would be better to try other options, or seek further advice about their financial difficulties, before lodging a debtor's petition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are no changes proposed for creditor's petitions, which may involve a contest between the creditor and the debtor as to whether a sequestration order should be made. Creditor's petitions are dealt with by court hearing before a judge, or a district or deputy district registrar of the Federal Court exercising delegated judicial powers. If a sequestration order is made, the bankrupt's estate is administered by a trustee, either a registered trustee or the Official Trustee&mdash;ITSA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consistent with the change to a single administrative agency for personal insolvencies, the bill proposes the transfer of the responsibility for maintaining bankruptcy records to ITSA from the court.

<PARA>ALTERNATIVES TO BANKRUPTCY DEBT AGREEMENTS&mdash;A NEW FORM OF INSOLVENCY ADMINISTRATION</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over a number of years, there have been calls for a form of insolvency administration outside bankruptcy and part X that can be used by people with low levels of debt, few assets and low incomes who are not able to afford to enter arrangements under part X of the act. With the recent rise in the number of bankruptcies, most of which are attributed by the bankrupt to either unemployment or excessive use of credit, the introduction of a new simple form of insolvency administration is timely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People who find themselves unable to pay all their debts or who may be unable to meet repayments due to a temporary change in income will no longer have to go bankrupt. Instead, they may put a proposal to creditors for dealing with their debts. Proposals might contain a request such as the payment of less than the full amount of all or any of the debtor's debts, a delay on payment, periodic payments out of income or agreement to seek financial advice. The essence of debt agreements is that they are made direct with creditors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Debtors on a relatively low gross income of approximately $36,000 per annum, with both debts and assets less than a threshold of approximately $52,000, will be eligible to make a debt agreement. A debt agreement will release the debtor from debts which <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> would be provable in bankruptcy as if the debtor had become a bankrupt when the agreement was recorded on the national personal insolvency index.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A debt agreement will operate to stay legal proceedings for enforcement of debts, other than debts or liabilities arising under a maintenance agreement or maintenance order. The debtor would put the proposal to the Official Receiver&mdash;that is, ITSA&mdash;which would be responsible for finding out whether the proposal was acceptable to the debtor's creditors. If the creditors agree to accept the debtor's proposal using the method set out in the bill, then the agreement will be registered by ITSA. Agreements can be varied and brought to an end using the same procedures. Also, the court will have power to declare a debt agreement to be void. Ordinarily, a debt agreement will end when the debtor has fulfilled all of his or her obligations under it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although the Official Receiver accepts or rejects debt agreement proposals, he or she will not necessarily perform a trustee function under a debt agreement, as would be the case of a trustee in a bankruptcy. Instead, a debt agreement could provide for the debtor to make payments to creditors directly, or for this to be done by some other third party or, perhaps, one of the creditors on behalf of the others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed debt agreements provide a real improvement for low income debtors who are interested in meeting their obligations to pay their debts. They should allow debtors the opportunity to obtain a `breathing space', during which time they can explore opportunities for dealing with debts outside of bankruptcy. This will avoid the stigma that bankruptcy entails while, at the same time, encouraging practical arrangements with creditors likely to result in a better return for them.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the proposed amendments, changes will be made to the provisions relating to transfers of property. These changes will apply to all new bankruptcies occurring after the commencement of the amendments. A transfer of property will be void against a trustee in certain circumstances. If the transfer takes place within five years of the date of commencement of the bankruptcy and the transferee&mdash;that is, the person who received the property&mdash;either gave no consideration for it or gave consideration that was less than market value for it, the transfer will generally be void against the trustee. The exception is where the transfer took place more than two years before the commencement of the bankruptcy and the transferee can show that the transferor was solvent at the time of the transfer. In these circumstances the transfer will not be void. For example, if a person transferred property to another four years before the date of bankruptcy for less than market value, and at the time the transferor was solvent, the transfer would not be void against the trustee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A transfer is also void against the trustee if the bankrupt's main purpose in transferring the property was to defeat or delay creditors, unless the transferee can prove that consideration of at least market value was given, if the transferee did not know the transferor's main purpose was to defeat creditors, and if the transferee could not have inferred that the transferor was, or was about to become, insolvent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In deciding whether consideration was given for the transfer of property, consideration will no longer include: promises to marry or become the de facto spouse of a person, the transferee's love and affection for the transferor, the making of a gift under deed where the transferee is the spouse or de facto spouse of the transferor, and the fact that the transferor is related to the transferee. For example, if a person gives property to another for love and affection, even one year before the commencement of their bankruptcy, the transfer will be void against the trustee. These <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> provisions balance the need to protect the rights of bona fide purchasers against those of creditors whose interests might otherwise be defeated by a bankrupt arranging his or her affairs before bankruptcy so as to place property beyond the reach of creditors.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A key amendment proposed by the bill in relation to the income contribution scheme is the revision of the definition of `income' to overcome the restrictive interpretation placed on it by the Federal Court in the case of Bond v. Ramsay (1994) 125 ALR 399. The bill includes amendments to restore the position to what it was believed and intended by the parliament to be prior to the Federal Court decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, the definition of `income' is to be further expanded so that it will include the value of `loans' given to the bankrupt. These amendments are designed to ensure that benefits obtained by bankrupts from loan accounts that cannot be characterised as assets forming part of the divisible property of the estate are taken to form part of the bankrupt's income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill includes other important changes to simplify the procedures for calculating the amount of income contribution that must be made by a bankrupt and to overcome anomalies in calculating part year amounts where a bankrupt has persons partially dependant on him or her.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill introduces a number of measures that will improve the effectiveness of bankruptcy law and practice and reduce unnecessary administrative procedures which will greatly improve the operation of the personal insolvency system.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The Legislative Instruments Bill 1996 will significantly reform the processes for making, publication, scrutiny and sunsetting of Commonwealth delegated legislation. As part of its law and justice and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A new deal for small business</EMPHASIS>  policies, the government undertook to introduce a strengthened Legislative Instruments Bill, with limited exemptions and provision for five-year sunsetting of regulations. The bill implements those policies and will perform a gatekeeper role in relation to legislative instruments, preventing the unchecked proliferation of delegated legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Proposals for a Legislative Instruments Bill arose in 1992 with the Administrative Review Council's report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rule making by Commonwealth agencies</EMPHASIS>. The council found that delegated legislation varied in quality and was inaccessible and obscure. It recommended the enactment of a Legislative Instruments Act to address problems with current procedures relating to delegated legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government introduced the Legislative Instruments Bill 1994 in response to the council's report. That bill was considered by several parliamentary committees, including the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, and many suggestions for change were made. The bill was awaiting passage in the Senate when parliament was prorogued prior to the 1996 election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amount of scrutiny the 1994 bill received is indicative of the importance of this legislation in reforming the procedures for making, publication and scrutiny of delegated legislation and in redefining the relationship between parliament and the executive. The Legislative Instruments Bill 1996 draws on <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> earlier work but is significantly strengthened by the introduction of sunsetting and a more structured consultation regime to represent the best achievable package of reforms. It represents a significant shift in control over delegated legislation back towards the parliament and increases government accountability through improved access and consultation mechanisms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will apply the same regime to all delegated `legislative instruments', instead of the varying requirements that may presently apply. This will provide greater certainty about the regime applicable to legislative instruments. The bill's coverage is determined by a definition of a legislative instrument, essentially based on the legislative character of instruments. There are very limited exemptions from the bill, and I do not expect these exemptions to be readily expanded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill introduces a mandatory consultation procedure for instruments directly affecting business or having a substantial indirect effect on business. Consultation will ensure the consideration of all relevant issues before delegated legislation is made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The consultation process will generally require public notification of a proposal to make a legislative instrument affecting business and the development of a legislative instrument proposal which analyses the need for the regulation, the costs and benefits of it and alternative ways of achieving the objectives of the proposal. This will allow public input into the proposal, and should ensure that any defects in the proposal are identified and can be addressed before the instrument is made. The extension of consultation beyond the business context will be considered in the review of the legislation in light of the experience gained in this more targeted approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill represents a radical new approach to providing access to delegated legislation. Primary legislation is already relatively accessible from Australian Government Publishing Service bookshops, the Internet and often public libraries. However, only some delegated legislation, mainly regulations, are easily accessible to the public. A substantial amount of delegated legislation is difficult to locate and obtain. This is unsatisfactory, as <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2830"> the community is entitled to know what laws exist and apply to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To overcome this problem the bill establishes the federal register of legislative instruments, which will consist of the scanned images of new and existing legislative instruments and an index. The text of information contained in the register will be searchable at AGPS bookshops and on the Internet. Ultimately, all Commonwealth delegated legislation will be available and searchable in one location.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After the commencement of this legislation, any new legislative instrument must be on the register to be enforceable. Existing instruments must be placed on the register according to a timetable in the bill, and if they are not registered by the relevant deadline will cease to be enforceable. This `backcapturing' procedure will work together with the sunsetting regime in the bill to ensure the regular review of legislative instruments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will ensure that parliament will have a greater role in the scrutiny of delegated legislation. All new legislative instruments will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. This is not currently the case with many legislative instruments. To achieve this outcome, the provisions of the Acts Interpretation Act dealing with construction and disallowance of regulations are being repealed and re-enacted in this bill. Parliament's powers in dealing with disallowable instruments will also be enhanced by enabling consideration of a disallowance motion to be deferred for up to six months. This will allow the rule-maker to remake or amend the instrument to achieve an objective specified in the deferral resolution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will prevent outdated and unnecessary legislative instruments remaining in force. This will reduce the number of outdated and unnecessary legislative instruments on the statute books, helping to lessen the regulatory burden on small business. To achieve this the bill will contain a comprehensive sunsetting regime&mdash;introducing five&hyphen;year sunsetting of new legislative instruments. Existing instruments will be sunsetted five years from the cut-off date for their backcapture onto the register.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This automatic repeal after five years will force agencies to regularly review the delegated legislation they administer. The bill will introduce the most comprehensive reforms to delegated legislation in Australia. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Deputy Speaker, this bill makes significant amendments to the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987. The act provides the statutory basis for Australia to negotiate, and give effect to, mutual assistance in criminal matters treaties, or other arrangements, with other countries relating to the provision of assistance in the investigation and prosecution of crime and the proceeds of crime. The act has been in force since 1 August 1988. Since that time 17 treaties which have been negotiated pursuant to the act have come into force. Another three treaties have been signed and are awaiting entry into force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia was one of the first common law countries to introduce such legislation. A considerable number of requests for mutual assistance in criminal matters has been handled under the act. This has been of enormous benefit to law enforcement and the conduct of criminal cases in Australia and other countries. This form of assistance is absolutely necessary for Australia to counter transnational crime, including drug trafficking and other forms of organised crime. The granting of mutual assistance is one of the most effective ways in which countries can help one another to meet these new threats.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2831">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the benefit of experience in administration of the act, it became increasingly apparent that the effectiveness of the act would be enhanced if improvements were made to it. A thorough review of the act was undertaken and for this purpose an issues paper was forwarded for comment to all federal, state and territory legal and law enforcement authorities, all federal, state and territory law societies, bar councils and the Law Council of Australia, and to representative civil liberties bodies. The issues paper made various recommendations for amendment; the majority of these were supported by respondent agencies and bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill implements the recommendations in the issues paper together with a small number of additional amendments, which are mostly of a technical and mechanical nature. The amendments have been drafted to meet any concerns expressed in response to the recommendations in the issues paper.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The major amendments to the act are contained in parts 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 of schedule 1. Parts 1, 2 and 3 contain amendments to the general scheme of the act. Part 4 contains new provisions restricting use of information in order that expectations as to confidentiality of other countries can be met.

<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Part 1 of Schedule 1, Object and application of the act</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part 1 of schedule 1 makes clear that the act is to be the exclusive channel for the execution of requests to Australia that would require Australia to exercise coercive powers, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> such as the issue of a summons to a person to attend a court to give evidence. It also confirms that the act is the exclusive channel for Australia to make mutual assistance requests to other countries to exercise coercive powers on our behalf. As reciprocity is an essential consideration in mutual assistance it is necessary that requests requiring coercive powers be handled by a central authority. However it is important to preserve existing channels for requesting and providing assistance which does not require the exercise of coercive powers, and the act recognises this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amended section 5 provides that one of the objects of the act is to `regulate' how Australia is to provide assistance to a requesting foreign country where the assistance sought falls within one of the listed types of assistance which require the exercise of coercive powers, for example the taking of evidence or production of documents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amended section will also contain a paragraph stating that one of the objects is to `facilitate' the provision of assistance by Australia in the making of arrangements for a person in Australia, including a prisoner, to travel to a foreign country to give evidence or assistance in relation to an investigation. This requires the performance of functions by the Attorney-General, or his or her delegate, but these functions do not involve the exercise of coercive powers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consequential upon amendment of section 5 in this manner is deletion from the list contained in section 5 of types of assistance which do not require exercise of coercive powers. These include the provision of documents or other articles, the location and identification of witnesses or suspects and the service of documents. These types of assistance could be provided to other countries prior to the commencement of the act. It is undesirable that the impression be created that such assistance is only available under the act. The purpose of the act is to provide necessary powers to execute requests, not to list forms of assistance that can be given under the act without the need for statutory powers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A consequence of the deletion from the objects section of the provision of assistance to a foreign country by service of documents <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2832"> in criminal matters is the repeal of the substantive section in the act, section 38. That section provided that the Attorney-General could make arrangements for service of documents in Australia on behalf of a requesting foreign country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amended section 5 will also contain a separate paragraph providing that the objects of the act are to facilitate the making of requests by Australia for the provision of assistance to it. This paragraph will not list any particular types of assistance, and the Attorney-General retains the power to make any type of request to a foreign country. Whether the requested foreign country will grant a request will depend on the domestic law of that country. Whether Australia would make a request to a country with which it does not have a treaty or other form of mutual assistance relationship will depend on an assessment in relation to the particular case at the particular time. One of the factors that would be taken into account in deciding this would be the expectation which would be raised in the requested country of reciprocal assistance by Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I consider these particular amendments will clarify the parameters within which assistance can be requested and provided both under the act and outside the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 7 currently requires the act to have been applied by regulation to a particular foreign country before assistance can be requested or provided. The amendment to section 7 represents a significant shift in Australia's approach to mutual assistance in criminal matters, by providing for `passive' application of the act to all foreign countries. This will enable assistance to be provided and requested much more expeditiously than previously, and will remove any extraneous impediments to the need for assistance to be urgently requested or provided.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Part 2 of Schedule 1, Requests for assistance</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment in part 2 of the bill to section 10 of the act confirms the exclusivity of the act in relation to the provision and requesting of assistance which involves coercive powers. The amendment provides that only the Attorney-General may make requests under the act. All requests which are <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> made under the act involve the foreign country in the exercise of coercive powers, with the technical exception of requests under section 16 for a foreign country to temporarily transfer a foreign prisoner to Australia to give evidence or assist an investigation&mdash;a type of assistance which should only be sought by the Attorney-General.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One effect of this amendment to section 10 is that a letter of request issued by any Australian court, including federal, state and territory courts, to a foreign court for evidence to be taken in the foreign country for use in a criminal matter in Australia should now be forwarded to the Attorney-General's Department for dispatch via established mutual assistance channels. Proposed subclause 11(4) provides that incoming letters of request, or `letters rogatory', which foreign courts might send direct to any Australian court, including federal, state and territory courts, seeking evidence to be taken in a criminal matter in the foreign country should be sent by the receiving Australian court to the Attorney-General. All incoming `take evidence' requests, including `court to court' requests, should be executed in a consistent manner pursuant to the Attorney-General's power under section 13 of the act to authorise a magistrate to take evidence on behalf of the foreign country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These two amendments should be of considerable assistance to state and territory courts in that they will enable all courts to take advantage of established channels of communication. The procedure will also enable effect to be given to Australia's policies in giving and receiving international assistance, subject of course to the grounds of refusal of assistance set out in section 8 of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments will clarify the Attorney-General's powers under sections 12 and 14 of the act to make requests to a foreign country for evidence to be taken, or documents produced, or a search and seizure warrant to be issued in accordance with the law of the foreign country. These are intended to remove any doubt that may have arisen as to the future admissibility into evidence of material that may have been obtained as a result of a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2833"> request on the sole ground that it was obtained otherwise than in accordance with the request.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This concern particularly arises in relation to search and seizure requests where the foreign country may be requested to obtain the material by way of a search warrant, because that would be the procedure used here, but where the country, in fact, obtains it pursuant to a notice to produce, or other similar instrument. However, I wish to make it quite clear that the usual protections available under Australian law will still apply when material is being assessed for admissibility by an Australian court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If a witness is giving evidence before a court in a foreign country as a result of a request by the Attorney-General under section 12 of the act, then the Australian court would need to take account of Australian rules of admissibility before admitting the material into evidence. Preservation of Australian requirements is the intention of proposed subclause 12(2).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As honourable members will be aware, the use of video equipment in the taking of evidence is a facility of increasing practical significance to our courts. The amendments to section 12 and to section 13 include the facility for courts to be requested to allow the person who is giving the evidence to be examined and cross-examined by video link from the requesting country. The use of video link technology will further enhance the value of evidence obtained by the requesting country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part 2 introduces an innovative provision, clause 39A, which will enable a defendant to apply to the Supreme Court of the relevant state or territory for a certificate that it would be in the interests of justice for the Attorney-General to make a mutual assistance request to a particular foreign country on behalf of the defendant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The act in its present form does not specifically prevent a government request for mutual assistance being made on behalf of a defendant. The new clause 39A removes any doubt as to the capacity for such requests to be made. It prescribes a mechanism which will require such requests to be transmitted <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> through the same channels as other mutual assistance requests and which will avoid any appearance of conflict of interest on the part of the Attorney-General where requests are made on behalf of the prosecution and defence in the same matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed clause enables a defendant to apply to the Supreme Court of the relevant state or territory for a certificate that it is in the interests of justice for the Attorney-General to make such a request. The clause reserves to the Attorney-General a residual discretion to refuse to make a request despite issue of a certificate by the court. This discretion, which would be exercised with great caution, would enable the Attorney-General to take into account Australia's wider mutual assistance relationship with a particular country over and above the interests of the defendant in having the request made on his or her behalf in the particular case.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Part 3 of Schedule 1, Refusal of assistance</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Significant amendments are made to the Attorney-General's power of refusal of requests for assistance. The death penalty has been abolished in all Australian jurisdictions since 1984, and Australia is party to the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which commits it to an anti-death penalty position at the international level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The insertion of new subclauses 8(1A) and 8(1B) into the act put it beyond any doubt that the granting of mutual assistance in criminal matters must take into account the possibility of imposition of the death penalty by the country which has requested the assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Subclause 8(1A) provides that where the foreign country requests assistance in relation to charges against a person, or a conviction against a person, which may lead to the imposition of the death penalty, assistance must be refused unless the Attorney-General is of the opinion that the special circumstances of the case require otherwise. The discretion for the Attorney-General to take into account special circumstances of the case would allow, for example, assistance to be granted where the assistance may be of an <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2834"> exculpatory nature and may assist the defendant in the foreign country to meet the charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where charges have not been laid in the foreign country but where the Attorney-General believes the provision of assistance could result in the imposition of the death penalty, the Attorney-General will have a wider discretion under proposed subclause 8(1B) to grant assistance after taking into account the interests of international criminal cooperation and the circumstances of the case. To avoid confusion, I mention that decisions under subclauses 8(1A) and 8(1B) relate only to assistance under the act. Assistance not involving coercive powers and given directly by police or other agencies is not regulated by the act but by administrative direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is desirable that the Attorney-General has a non-specific residual ground of refusal which will enable refusal of a request other than for one of the specific grounds. Accordingly, a new paragraph is inserted into subsection 8(2) of the act; this is the subsection which lists a number of discretionary grounds of refusal. Previously it was a mandatory ground of refusal under paragraph 8(1)(g) that the act had not been applied to the requesting foreign country. The removal of that paragraph by this part of the bill was a necessary consequence of the amendment to section 7, which gives the Attorney-General the ability to consider a request from any country. In this situation it is appropriate that the Attorney-General has a residual discretionary refusal ground.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When foreign countries provide sensitive material to us in response to a mutual assistance request, or where they make their own requests to Australia for assistance, it is often an expectation of the foreign country that confidentiality of the information be respected and that its use be restricted. Unless Australia meets such confidentiality requirements, it is likely to find that other countries will be legally unable, or reluctant, to provide assistance to us. The amendments therefore provide for offences of intentional unauthorised use and disclosure.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An additional bar to unauthorised use is that proposed clause 43B provides that material received from a foreign country is inadmissible in any proceedings other than those for which it was obtained from the foreign country unless the Attorney-General has approved such use. This inadmissibility will extend to derivative use. In other words, any information, document, article or thing obtained directly or indirectly as a result of unauthorised use will not be admissible in any other proceedings and may not be used for the purposes of any other investigation. The Attorney-General would not normally approve such use or disclosure without first receiving any necessary consent of the foreign country.</PARA>

Schedule 2 contains a consequential amendment to the FTR act as a result of the `passive application' of the act amendments contained in section 7 of the act. Subsection 7(2A) currently requires specific regulations before the secrecy provisions of the FTR act can be lifted and the Attorney-General is enabled to grant a foreign country access to FTR information. There was a similar provision in the FTR act which cross-referred to the need for subsection 7(2A) regulations before access to FTR information could be granted to the Attorney-General for such purposes.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2835">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The `passive application' of the act amendments make both provisions redundant.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The consequential amendments to the Proceeds of Crime Act extend our ability to obtain interim restraining orders on behalf of a foreign country to certain limited situations where the foreign country has not yet laid charges. Relevant provisions of the Proceeds of Crime Act enable us to obtain such orders in Australia where charges have not yet been laid so long as they are laid within the ensuing 48 hours.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>This bill seeks to ensure that the Australian national flag cannot be changed unless the people of Australia have been consulted and a majority of those voting indicate their support for a different design. The government believes that the people of Australia are entitled to be consulted about their nation's symbols. Nowhere is this more important than with the Australian national flag&mdash;our oldest and most important national symbol.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our national flag has a history which goes back to 1901 when its design was selected after a public competition which attracted over 30,000 entries. The existing national flag is declared in section 3 of the Flags Act 1953 and its design is reproduced in a schedule to the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the Flags Bill was introduced in 1953 it received enthusiastic bipartisan support. I trust that this bill, which gives legislative expression to the commonly held view that any change to the flag is a matter for the Australian people, will receive equally enthusiastic support from all sides of the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now turn to the details of the bill. The bill does not seek to override the right of parliament to legislate. Any new flag which might be chosen would become law by the action of parliament. What this bill does say in subsection 3(2) is that the current national flag shall only cease to be the Australian national flag if, and only if, the majority of the Australian electorate have approved an alternative design. This section also requires that the existing national flag will always be amongst the choices offered to the electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Subsection 3(3) of the bill leaves parliament to prescribe the manner in which a proposal for any alternative design or designs for a new Australian national flag should be submitted to the electors, the manner in which the vote is to be taken, and the arrangements that might need to be put in place if an alternative design is ever selected as a new national flag.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key intent of this legislation is to reflect the principle that the Australian national flag belongs to the Australian people and that the Australian people have the right to be consulted in any proposal to change the flag. This bill provides the parliament with the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2836"> means to give to the people of Australia, a guarantee that they will decide if the national flag, their national flag, should be changed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a flag which was chosen by Australians. It is the flag the people of Australia have been united under since federation. It has been the symbol of our nationhood and our community for five generations. It is the only flag flown over a whole continent. It symbolises our history, our geography and our system of government. It is the flag Australian men and women have served so well under in times of war. It is the flag under which we have claimed sporting glory. It is the flag under which this very parliament meets. It flies above this very chamber as a reminder of the sovereignty of the people. We are committed to recognising that sovereignty by giving the Australian people the right to decide the future of their national flag. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has not been an agreement to conclude the debate this evening. But it is a very fair thing that about 3&half; hours should be set aside for the consideration in detail stage of the debate on this particular legislation. On the basis that we do not have any more frolics or antics from the opposition, the total time to be spent debating this legislation will be something in the order of 19 hours, which is a very significant debate in this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It compares, of course, very favourably with the 13 or 14 hours which we had when Labor's legislation in 1993 was debated in this House. It is true that this legislation is far more important than Labor's legislation and for that reason much more time has been allocated for the debate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I was saying, that will give us about 19 hours for this debate, which compares very favourably with the 13 or 14 hours that we had with the Brereton legislation. In terms of the number of speakers, on one estimate we have had approximately 48 speakers so far, which is a very large number of members from both sides of the House, and obviously we will be able to have further speakers until 7 p.m. on the second reading. For the benefit of new members, we do not have a speakers list for the consideration in detail stage and that will provide further very ample opportunities for people to make a contribution to the debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the time&hyphen;honoured traditions of this House, my opposite number, the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean), will rise in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2838"> a moment with a forceful, persuasive speech to say how he is being denied an opportunity to speak. I do not deny him his opportunities, as he builds his leadership credentials within the other side, to give such a speech. I say to the honourable member that we on this side will enjoy such a contribution by him and we will mark it by the professionalism of his contribution. I can say there are a number of us on this side who have given such speeches in the past and so we are more than able to fairly adjudicate on his contribution. But will it be persuasive when analysed? The answer is: of course not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason I say that is just look at the way in which they are dealing with this division in this particular debate. This is the opposition which a couple of weeks ago was saying, `Can we have some cooperation? Can we have some sense of discussion and agreement about the procedures of the House?' We have responded very favourably to that, and the reason we have responded favourably to that is so that these time diversions can be avoided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have just had a division on the first of these two motions. Last night when we had such a division one of the opposition members sitting at the front bench here actually turned to the Manager of Opposition Business and said, `Why are we having this division?' What a good question it was, because you are actually denying your own people the opportunity to speak. I therefore look forward with great pleasure to this contribution. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YK6">Mr WILTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you. The independent umpire, the AIRC, is expressly prohibited from making an award which sets either maximum or minimum hours of work for part&hyphen;time employees. This means that the hours that a part&hyphen;time employee can work each week will be wholly and solely a matter for the employer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Women should be greatly concerned about this, as I am sure the member for Lindsay (Ms Jackie Kelly) is, following her submission to the parliament this afternoon. A part&hyphen;time employee who normally works 20 hours a week can simply be told, on the Monday, that she need only work for six hours that week, and there will be no independent umpire to prevent this. Part&hyphen;time employees will have no certainty whatsoever about the hours they work each week, nor about the money that they are entitled to earn.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Migrants, many of whom are not fluent in English, are already at a disadvantage when confronted with the possibility of direct negotiations with their employers, many of whom, no doubt, will take advantage of these disempowered migrant employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a speech to ACOSS, made on 22 May this year, Dr David Kemp&mdash;the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training&mdash;said that young people could be required to work for a weekly take&hyphen;home wage equivalent to the dole, or flagged sentiments of a similar nature. The government's bill allows for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2842"> employers to decide how much of the time spent at work is `training'. The `training' could take place entirely on the job. Combined, these factors mean that a young person could be forced to attend work for five days a week but be paid for one, two or&mdash;at best&mdash;three days a week. Worse still, the only guarantee that the training is genuine is approval from some amorphous `approving authority' which, according to the legislation, can be declared by anyone. That might mean that, for example, Amanda Vanstone, or David Kemp himself, could be an `approving authority'. The coalition's plan to cut youth wages to $3.05 per hour has finally been flushed out. It stands in rather extraordinary contrast to the Prime Minister's pre&hyphen;election rhetoric.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As many members would be aware, Australia is already faced with a shortage of skilled labour in many trades. The provisions contained within this draconian and short&hyphen;sighted bill will only exacerbate that situation, by providing a considerable disincentive to young people to take on apprenticeships. Those who are willing to take on such apprenticeships are effectively forgoing substantial amounts of income in their early working years, and are often paid at a far lower rate than those in other, similar forms of employment. The bill will make life much more difficult for apprentices, as it cuts their real wages even further by not including training time as hours worked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, when it comes to the consideration of a career, for many of Australia's young people an apprenticeship will simply no longer be worth the effort and the sacrifice&mdash;particularly in financial terms&mdash;that will be required. There is no doubt that, therefore, Australia will become the `poor white trash' of the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region, and will be forced to import both skilled and semiskilled workers to make up for the shortfall in this abhorrent and ridiculous policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation also fails to deliver the promises to secure award entitlements, promises made last year by the then opposition during the election campaign. Workers would be worse off under the proposed arrangements and would not be relaxed and comfortable <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> about the outlook at their workplace should this bill be passed without significant amendment. Indeed the words `relaxed and comfortable' were used notably by the Prime Minister during the election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like the Prime Minister perhaps to explain to the House how it could possibly be that workers will be relaxed and comfortable when they do not receive a copy of their AWA until after they have commenced work&mdash;nor are they allowed to show it to anyone. How could they be relaxed and comfortable when they have to issue their union with a written invitation from at least two workers to have the union visit their workplace and must furnish a copy of this letter to their employer, or when they do not know from one week to the next how many hours they will be required to work as part&hyphen;timers or what their likely wages might be? I would not feel relaxed and comfortable when forced to sign a work contract without the benefit of advice or representation from my union.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, I would not be relaxed and comfortable in the event of being subjected to signing a state employment agreement in my state of Victoria, or indeed in Tasmania or Western Australia, which will override the federal award and provide wages and conditions which are considerably reduced from those which employees in those states currently enjoy. I would not be relaxed and comfortable when measures specifying the supply of protective clothing and equipment are no longer prescribed as part of minimum award conditions. Nor would I feel such when being penalised financially for increasing my work skills through training and apprenticeships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would not feel relaxed and comfortable when as a female worker the chances of obtaining equal pay to men are greatly diminished given the clear historical evidence as alluded to earlier in my speech. I am sure that migrant workers would not feel relaxed and comfortable, those in particular who have a poor command of the English language and little knowledge of the industrial relations system. They would be forced to negotiate a complex legal document under intimidating <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2843"> circumstances in the presence of the seemingly all&hyphen;powerful employer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I would not feel relaxed or comfortable when the independent arbitrator, the AIRC&mdash;as I have already said&mdash;has been gutted of its powers to conciliate and arbitrate and to provide a safety net against returning Australia to the 1950s concept of managerial prerogative. The 1950s approach of the government is not surprising when you consider the out&hyphen;of&hyphen;touch approach to industrial relations exhibited by some of those opposite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps the greatest indicator by those opposite of the level of loathing of the union movement which underpins and drives this bill&mdash;and in particular in many first speeches in this place&mdash;is the way they have derisively referred to `union bosses', so&hyphen;called. While these so&hyphen;called union bosses have assisted in the delivery of moderate wage outcomes, in recognition of the need to keep the inflation genie in the bottle, the corporate bosses whose jobs and status those opposite in large part covet have wallowed in the trough of massive and unjustifiable increases in remuneration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Earning significantly less than those same corporate bosses, the so&hyphen;called union bosses have positions which demonstrate their level of social responsibility and commitment. That commitment primarily is to realising real gains in disposable income for workers in the union that they represent, primarily through the agency of the prices and incomes accord which promoted the realisation also of sustainable wage outcomes as an additional tool of economic management while simultaneously delivering real increases in family based disposable income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those opposite claim, of course, that the bill is neither there to discourage union membership nor to discourage freedom of association but that really flies in the face of those opposite who fully support the veto of the right of entry of union officials into the workplace. The job of those same officials is primarily to protect the interests of employees in the face of the activities of all too often paternalistic or maternalistic employers. Employers often&mdash;and I have experienced it&mdash; <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> say to their employees, `Don't worry, she'll be right, we'll look after you.' In many cases that may be true but employers are not nearly as benevolent as those opposite might believe. In fact, there have been a number of cases drawn in this place today by members on my side of the House to highlight specific instances where benevolence is an all too rare commodity on the employer front.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be many aspects of working conditions not contained within the so&hyphen;called safety net that employers will attempt to manipulate to the disadvantage of employees who will no longer enjoy the same democratic right of access to either their union or the dramatically curtailed AIRC. The system of compulsory arbitration, by its nature, provides some pressure on employers to negotiate in good faith as the outcome of the failure to do so is compulsory arbitration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the emphasis in the industrial relations system has changed to one which places a greater obligation on the parties to bargain, the removal of compulsory arbitration also effectively removes the requirement to bargain in good faith. There is a need for the inclusion of a good faith bargaining provision in the legislation which should include a time limit at the end of which access will be available to compulsory arbitration. Such compulsory arbitration is available under item 170MX but only in the case of industrial action being taken as detailed in item 170MW(3). This means effectively that industrial action is now to be a requirement before there can be access to compulsory arbitration&mdash;a notion which is patently absurd in the extreme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The concept of bargaining in good faith is one which has underpinned the prices and incomes accord and one that the union movement takes particularly seriously. This is manifested in the fact that the number of working days lost through strikes since the last period of significant industrial disharmony in Australia's history&mdash;those being the turbulent Fraser years&mdash;has, of course, plummeted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The union movement and the accord have fostered and underpinned a cooperative working environment, one of the foundations <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2844"> of which, of course, is that same notion of bargaining in good faith. The response of government to the union movement's efforts both to ensure moderate wage outcomes in line with inflation targets and also to dramatically improve productivity and flexibility in a dispute free environment is to rip asunder the very framework upon which this was all constructed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some components of the framework which have been ripped asunder include, in brief, the curtailing, as I have said, of access to the workplace by union officials; the abolition of the trade union training authority; and, of course, the destruction of the AIRC. These are some of the changes that will not be gained without the cooperation of Australian workers. Their cooperation will not be secured by ignoring or devaluing the type of productivity based changes that have been made by workers, often with significant sacrifices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have briefly alluded to the limited future of the AIRC. Some of the cuts to it which greatly concern this side of the House go to the question of the commission's power to prevent or settle industrial disputes by arbitration under limited or non&hyphen;existent future jurisdictional circumstances. That same jurisdiction is now confined to 18 extremely limited prescribed matters. The commission has also been restricted, for example, in its power to make awards. It has been precluded from making or varying a paid rates award and it no longer has any functions or powers in reviewing enterprise or workplace agreements. Regretfully, there is nothing contained in this legislation to promote or to foster the sort of security that I have just outlined and, therefore, cooperation by workers in the ongoing process of Australia's economic development and reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even before Prime Minister Bruce lost his seat of Flinders in October 1929 to the then union official Ted Holloway, in an election relating primarily to the removal of compulsory arbitration or arbitration, Australians always rejected such legislation if the electorate realised that it denied workers the right to a fair go. I have no doubt that they will do so again. I commend the amendments contained within the bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Ever since the Labor Party instituted the unfair dismissal laws I wanted to become a member of parliament. I have wanted to stand in this place and I have wanted to do whatever I could do to vote those laws down because, after 25 years of running a small business, I understand exactly what damage that has done to the business community in this country. I understand exactly what it has done to jobs. I understand how the community now employs people on a casual basis and gives them no security in their jobs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last September, the Townsville Chamber of Commerce conducted a survey among their members who represent about 500 businesses in the Townsville and Thuringowa regions. The survey was conducted to identify issues, both big and small, that the chamber should address. Of course, top of the list was unfair dismissals. I would like to give the parliament an example of the kind of thing that has occurred. Just last week a charitable body in Townsville&mdash;a charitable body, mind you&mdash;was having difficulty with an uncontrollable employee. That uncontrollable employee went to the AGM of that charitable body with relatives, trying to stack the meeting to overturn the management of the place. It caused that employee to have tremendous stress and the employee went on stress leave. Seven months later, the employee was still on stress leave.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Management can, after three months, give notice to an employee. In fact, they persisted with the employee, trying to make sure that the employee could come back to the job. But after seven months that was just too long to wait. They made that employee redundant. The employee responded by claiming $6,000 for unfair dismissal, after seven months of being on stress leave. The charitable body said, `We are not up to paying $6,000.' So the advocate for the employee said, `We will take you to a five&hyphen;day hearing and that is going to cost you $10,000.' The gun was at their head.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That charitable body paid $4,000 last week to settle the claim because they had no alternative. The advocate was saying, `We will take you to court and we will bring out all <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2845"> this dirt in the court.' A charitable body cannot have that. A charitable body has got to avoid all those sorts of matters. The conclusion drawn from that is that, in any action that is going to cost less than $3,000, employers are basically just paying up and not fighting under this loaded legislation. They are just taking what the best commercial outcome is, not what was right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As both Senator Ian Macdonald and I&mdash;he is on the road to recovery, by the way&mdash;have been saying to the Townsville, Thuringowa and North Queensland business communities, the proposed changes to the unfair dismissal laws are necessary and long overdue. The process will be simpler and fairer with a heavier emphasis to be placed on the merits of a case rather than legal moot points and legal blackmail, giving everyone concerned a fair go all round.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I conclude I am going to repeat the words of the member for Flinders (Mr Reith), because they need to be driven home. Labor's unfair dismissal laws have `discouraged investment and diverted the attention of industry from its prime task of making workplaces more efficient and providing more real jobs'. The coalition's proposed changes to unfair dismissal laws go a long way to achieving just that: more efficient workplaces and more real jobs. I am proud to have been the last speaker to drive that point home in the parliament here tonight.</PARA>

<PARA>Government amendment No. 1 is a technical amendment. Its purpose is to provide that the provision inserted in the bill by government amendment No. 60 will commence on royal assent. This is appropriate because amendment No. 60 makes a change that will be necessary if a particular amendment of the Federal Court Act has already been made by the time this bill receives royal assent. There is therefore no reason to postpone the commencement of that change until a date to be proclaimed. It should take effect as soon as the bill receives royal assent.</PARA>

Where there are other matters where the opposition is proposing a particular change of a more constructive nature&mdash;as opposed to just outright opposition&mdash;to the government's propositions, I say to the opposition that, unfortunately, we have had limited opportunity to look at its amendments.

I simply give notice that we do not dismiss each and every one of the opposition's proposed amendments. We will certainly be going over them with a fine toothcomb. Where we think there is a constructive amendment to make a good bill an even better bill, that will be the attitude we take.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should also say, with your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the government has a number of amendments which we are moving to our bill. Some of those amendments have come as a result of representations that have been made to us since the bill was introduced into the House. That is our ongoing approach: where representations are made, where we might have missed something, where we made a technical change or where there is an improvement we can make to the bill from a policy perspective, we continue to have an open mind in that regard.</PARA>

<PARA>To an outside observer, amendments to objects clauses can look merely symbolic because they are very general; they are about what the bill is about. We regard the amendments that the government proposes and, more particularly in terms of these few remarks, our amendments to the bill as both symbolic and more than just symbolic. They are of symbolic significance because they emphasise and highlight the contrasting approach between government and opposition. Many of my colleagues will wish to take the opportunity to speak to them, if for no other reason than that the recent initiatives by the government prevented them from making their contributions at the second reading stage. They also emphasise the contrast in priorities and philosophies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More than this, the objects clause can be and often is an important guide to interpretation of the operative clauses of the bill. For that reason, we want to give this serious and detailed consideration. I will not have time in five minutes to go through all the aspects of the amendment. I may come back to it depending upon the opportunities my colleagues take in support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to initially refer to three differences in (a), (b) and (c) of the amendment. The first is the proposal that we should not merely refer to workplace relations but to the broader issue of industrial relations. The second is the inclusion of an explicit commitment to better pay. The third is the emphasis on a fair labour market as well as a flexible one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2849"> To take these points in turn, once again, the change from the concept of workplace rela tions to industrial relations is not just a semantic difference; it says something substantial about one's view about the workplace relationship. The relations between employers and employees are not solely dominated by matters of exclusive or singular workplace significance or responsibility. They often refer to matters of broader industry significance, broad industry standards and matters of concern to the entire work force, for example issues of superannuation. When there are superannuation arrangements beyond those in the superannuation guarantee charge, they almost always refer to industry&hyphen;wide characteristics that tend to influence the nature of the superannuation arrangements. For example, in the hospitality industry there is the example which I raised in question time a few weeks ago. We want to emphasise that broader view of the nature of the relationship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn briefly to the commitment to better pay. The coalition were full of rhetoric about better pay when they were in opposition. There is not much in this bill which says anything about it. To buttress their argument that they are about better pay, they even had to invent some data to suggest that average weekly earnings had fallen during the 13 years of the Labor government. I will not take the time to rebut that because the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) did it very effectively in his speech in the second reading debate and the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) tells me that he did too, and I am sure he is right. I heard the member for Gellibrand doing it and it was very effective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know the monetary policy of the government suggests that any time increases in wages go above the 4.5 per cent maximum established by the Reserve Bank, they are going to be met by increases in interest rates. So it is very hard to see how you can talk about better pay in those circumstances and in the absence of a wages policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> I briefly comment on what is actually the most important of these three initial points, which is the emphasis on a fair labour market. There has been a lot of proper attention given to the issue of flexibility in the labour market. I do not argue that we can avoid moving towards a flexible labour market. The previ ous government did not; I do not. It is an international fact of life. But Australia was able to develop a unique model of coping with the pressures of internationalisation, of moving towards enhanced flexibility while maintaining the traditional Australian commitment to fairness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The provisions of this bill, to the extent to which they actually do create greater opportunities for flexibility&mdash;and I think that is wildly exaggerated&mdash;do it without any reference to the elements that have put that balance between flexibility and fairness into the Australian industrial relations system. Those things have been unique Australian elements of the process which all Western democracies have been seeking to come to grips with, as to how you manage your labour market in a growing internationalised commodity market and services market. Most of them have done it in a way that emphasised flexibility and did not give sufficient attention to fairness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the social, industrial and economic consequences of that have not been positive. We do not support Australia going down that road. We think that balance between flexibility and fairness is important. That it is left out of the objects clause is a not insignificant matter as a symbol of the distinction between the government and the opposition. They have many such symbolic differences, and this is one to which I wish to give initial emphasis.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 delivers a fair deal to women. The workplace is the sphere where goods and services are produced and exchanged, but the most important sphere in human society is the private sphere of the home. Goods and services are just the things that we need to get through life. Our families are our lives. These are the realities that women in the paid work force must deal with every day. What we need, therefore, are conditions that are sensitive to the fact that employees have family commitments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the important features of this bill is that it retains the award system as a comprehensive safety net for all workers so women and families cannot go backwards. It does this by ensuring that a number of minimum <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2850"> conditions&mdash;some of which are vital to women&mdash;cannot be traded off. These include personal or carer's leave, including sick leave; family leave; bereavement leave; compassionate leave; and parental leave, including maternity and adoption leave. But over and above all these core provisions, this bill offers women with family responsibilities an opportunity through negotiation for flexible working conditions that has never been offered to them before, underpinned by the safety net of the award system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people who fear the flexibility that this bill has to offer most are those whose imaginations can roam no wider than the restrictive framework over the ages by the boys of the union movement. One thing that the boys have not managed to come to terms with all that well is that workplaces are a changing; indeed, the world is a changing. Women are now major players in workplaces and women have family responsibilities. It is a sad reflection on post-industrialised society that I have to stand here in this place and specifically say that women have family responsibilities, because parents come in two sexes. But the post-industrialised world is one where inflexible workplaces have forced one parent, all too often the mother, to stay at home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a well-known historical reality that in the sixties and seventies the women fought back. The feminist revolution arising out of these times resulted in irreversible social and cultural change. Women now comprise over 42 per cent of the paid work force, yet as a whole we earn only 65 per cent of the wages that men earn. Not only are we underpaid in the job market, but contemporary research still reveals that we go home at night and, because SNAGs are still more of a myth than a reality, we take responsibility for the jobs that have to be performed there too.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current system has let women down. This is highlighted by the fact that the union movement has impressed we women with its relevance to us so much that less than one-third of those of us who participate in the paid work force have bothered to join it. Whilst 42 per cent of women in the paid work force are in part-time positions, 81 per cent of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> all women say that they would prefer part-time employment so that they could spend more time with their children. I have not been able to locate any surveys that have sought to ask men the same question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Awards have traditionally stifled the availability of flexible working arrangements because they have included ceilings on part-time employment. In fact, a survey of major awards performed for the 1995 personal carer's leave test case showed that 14.6 per cent do not provide for part-time work. These restrictions to the availability of part-time work are removed by this bill. The removal of limits to part-time positions has the potential to resolve the situation where many women find themselves in casual employment instead of the more desired and secure part-time permanent employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further significant issue for women in this bill is the principle of equal pay&mdash;a principle enshrined in the bill as a minimum condition for all formal agreements. The bill provides women with the opportunity to take complaints if they are discriminated against in terms of their pay on the basis of their gender to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. If their complaint involves direct compliance with a federal award or certified agreement, it will be referred to the Industrial Relations Commission for resolution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Office of the Employment Advocate also provides a better deal for women. The functions of the Employment Advocate, as determined in this bill, include to provide advice to employers and employees in regard to their obligations under the act and in regard to the process of developing an Australian workplace agreement. The office will also provide free legal advice to assist with court proceedings initiated under the act in connection with Australian workplace agreements. Further, on application to the Employment Advocate, women can gain an examination of their own and other agreements to identify discrepancies in rates of pay which are gender based.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I certainly agree with the previous speaker, the member for Kingston (Ms Jeanes), that more women than ever before are combining work <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2851"> with families. It is the case that 1.45 million women with dependent children are now in the work force, and just over 400,000 of these women have dependent children under the school age of five.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The important points I want to make today are these. The integral role played by women in the work force is, of course, matched by the integral role of women's earnings in contributing to family incomes and the quality of life enjoyed by families, especially children. The pursuit of equal pay, which has always been a matter of social justice and equity, is now a matter of great economic importance for women and their families. How we deal with family matters is now incorporated into working arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the election campaign, the coalition sought to portray itself as supportive of more family friendly workplace arrangements, and we have heard a lot about that in the debate on this bill. But now we see the bill in its true form, and we can see where the problems for women are likely to emerge. There are three areas where they will occur: firstly, awards; secondly, agreements; and, thirdly, equal pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Overreaching all of these are the issues of the role and powers of the Industrial Relations Commission. Australia has had a unique system of arbitration and awards and they have protected women workers more than alternative systems. We can see that by looking at international comparisons of equal pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australian women's earnings relative to men's are far higher here than in the United States, Britain or Japan and  are just below the Scandinavian countries, which are the world leaders. Those figures, I think, are the substantive issues. If we compare award rates of pay&mdash;and this is the critical issue&mdash;for non&hyphen;managerial full-time adults, we find that women now earn 93.8 per cent of men's earnings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The role of the Industrial Relations Commission in delivering these benefits through test cases has been crucial&mdash;equal pay for equal work in 1969, equal pay for equal value in 1972 and the maternity leave case in 1995. The women opposite and the minister might ask why it is that 30 different women's <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> groups have come out against this bill because of its implications for women in the work force.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That's right. Have a look in the newspapers&mdash;they are all listed. They have come out in this way for a number of different reasons. Awards will not be able to contain provisions regulating part-time work. Some 41 per cent of women workers work on a part-time basis, and women make up 75 per cent of the part-time work force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current award provisions generally require a ratio of full&hyphen;time to part-time workers in order to ensure the maintenance of full&hyphen;time jobs in industries such as the retail industry and in clerical occupations, and this is very important for women who want to pursue careers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part-time work provisions in awards&mdash;and I think this is the critical issue in answer to many of the points that have been raised by those opposite&mdash;require minimum and maximum hours of work for part-time workers in order to ensure that these workers are given reasonable work opportunities: for example, a four-hour minimum requirement is common. This prevents people's days from being disrupted by an hour's work here and an hour's work there. If you think that a family can organise child care and all the other things that families need with an hour's work here and an hour's work there&mdash;a family never knowing what the future is going to hold for them&mdash;then you have got another think coming. That does not improve family life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The coalition is also proposing to abolish paid rates awards, and this will particularly affect women in the public sector&mdash;nurses, teachers and community service workers. These women workers are not in a position to negotiate enterprise agreements because their employers depend on government funding. These are just some of the important issues that I have been able to raise in the time available. Of course there are many others and I hope I will be able to speak later in the debate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak to the principal object of the bill and the intended amendments of the opposition. The Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Bill 1996 is an endeavour in workplace reform that takes an extra step in creating a flexible, equitable, productive and higher wages driven industrial relations system. In layman's terms, it will mean to the average worker&mdash;from the one on the shop floor to the one in the secretarial pool or to the sales assistant&mdash;that real effort will be rewarded under our package of reforms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This has tremendous ramifications for our domestic economy&mdash;the business sector, the large firms but, more importantly, the 860,000 forgotten small businesses nationwide which have been left in Struggle Street under a hard Labor economic regime. The lack of respite from a truly productive driven wages system has had an indelible impact. For a nation which was all too willing to open up the trade barriers, to bring down the tariff walls, to fully deregulate the financial sector and float the dollar, and to open up the floodgates of competition onto varied government enterprises, it somehow excluded industrial relations from the big reform picture leaving a very messy canvass indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The accord model between the former government and the ACTU failed because, quite simply, it did not deliver on what it promised&mdash;that is, the long-term provision of jobs for all Australians and increased productivity performance in the workplace. The protracted levels of unemployment at the height of the recession, the continued mass of young jobless and the growth of a new working poor are testimony to the failure of the accord to deliver on the first point alone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where labour productivity from 1910 to 1973 matched the three per cent growth annually, let me advise this House that between 1980 and 1992, which covers the bulk of the accord's history, it could only splutter along at 1.3 per cent. These labour market figures lacked not only `wow' but a lot of `pow' as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we continue to listen to our colleagues from across the other side, let us not forget some of the grand architects of the accord <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> process&mdash;for they now hold prominence in this chamber. The honourable member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) and the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean) take their seats in this House and continue to sing the same old rhetorical song, day in, day out, as though the wages accord was a blessing from upon high to workers. Meanwhile, the likes of Jennie George and Bill Kelty continue to belt the dogma drum of an industrial relations Armageddon under the stewardship of John Howard and Peter Reith. Their claims are boorish and are way off the mark.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> We must not let slide just what this idle rhetoric actually means: a Dickensian era for wage earners could again darken and downtrod their lives. Charles Dickens, the eminent English writer of some 20 books, included in his works the great literary offering <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Great Expectations</EMPHASIS>. The Australian  community has great expectations, too, of what the Howard government can deliver via a reinvigorated evolutionary industrial relations reform package, even if it is sending many union officials around the Oliver Twist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no question that we are on the verge of significant cultural change being built into the industrial relations system. But the point about the workplace relations bill is that it accepts that change, simply for change's sake, just will not work. Instead, we are instituting changes which have evolved principally from changes at the coalface in the workplace. Make no mistake: this bill is about ongoing evolution, not industrial revolution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will evolve into a system that affirms freedom of association and ends the industrial relic of a time now long past, in that it will end compulsory unionism. It will evolve into a system that will provide individual employees with greater choice and flexibility in wage negotiation in the marketplace, with the safety net of the award there to protect any possible fall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will see evolve real incentives for individual workplaces to sit down and nut out the best deal all round for both the boss and his or her workers to enhance the business bottom line, whilst boosting the bulge of money in the behinds of the staff. And critically, what will evolve is industrial relations legislation <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2853"> worthy of the work culture of those it will increasingly come to accommodate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to the principal objects section of the legislation. The government's proposal is based on a fallacy, that is, it can have fair and effective agreement making without fair and effective bargaining. It assumes that there is an equality of might in the bargaining process between employers and employees. Regrettably, that is quite simply not the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Practitioners in industrial relations, whether they be trade union, employer organisation or legal practitioner, know it is a fallacy to assume that an industrial conflict is initiated by one side or the other. It is true that the existence of trade unions has facilitated the taking of collective industrial action. But it is quite fallacious, however, to say that unions have caused industrial conflict.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, that is recognised in the current legislation to an extent, in that the definition of industrial action includes the concept of an employer initiated lockout.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The employment relationship is not static. There are constant changes arising primarily from economic circumstances, technological change and, increasingly, social change. Those changes create, and will continue to create, tensions and, if inappropriately addressed, those tensions can quickly lead to conflict.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It must also be said that both employees and trade unions on the one hand and employers and employer organisations on the other have on occasions acted irresponsibly. Any experienced industrial relations practitioner will tell you that when you are speaking of intense industrial disputation, you are speaking of an environment which is one of the least likely to obtain reason and compromise. You are often talking about substantial amounts of money, often millions and millions of dollars, depending on the outcome. You are always talking about the assertion of power and you are frequently talking about hidden political agendas, not <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> only within union ranks but also within the ranks of management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is ignorance in the extreme to assert, or even contemplate, that those realities will disappear because sanctions are introduced, which is what this bill fundamentally hangs its hat on. The existence of sanctions in the Commonwealth Industrial Peace Act 1920 did nothing to solve the strike action at the Rothbury mine in 1929, when Norman Brown was shot during coercive police action which was trying to break up the strike. While there were no television cameras in those days, we do see on television ugly situations resulting from industrial conflict. Such scenes have fortunately become less frequent as a result of the more cooperative approach to industrial relations that has developed, but they are still abhorrent to the average Australian.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even conservative governments have in the past realised the futility of coercion in industrial relations. This legislation will introduce, however, the concept of interlocutory injunctions into industrial conflict. Those injunctions are obtained without an employer having to discharge any onus of proof but merely the balance of inconvenience as a result of the industrial action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation is reminiscent of the old bans clause tactics leading up to the gaoling of Clarrie O'Shea in 1969. Before that practice, in 1955 there were only three fines imposed on trade unions to the value of $2,500.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As commentators have mentioned, a major problem with such injunctions was that employers increasingly showed a propensity to hide behind them rather than to bargain with unions. That is precisely what will occur with the present legislation. It is based on conflict and it is based on penalty. The legislation is quite simply dangerous. It reflects what Jeff Shaw, the Attorney&hyphen;General of New South Wales, warned against, and that was creating a huge gulf between the theory of the law and the practical conduct of Australian citizens.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to speak on the first of the opposition's many amendments to the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. I also note that this first amendment deals with the principal objects of the act, in which case we can talk broadly across the whole subject of the legislation, until we get down to some of the more specific amendments, as the night wears on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is about Australia's future. It has been introduced into this House after long consultation with many interested parties&mdash;employer and employee groups, state and territory governments, church, ethnic, community and welfare organisations. The ACTU was also consulted. The resulting bill has a coordinated approach to reforming the workplace, to ensuring a fair deal for both employee and employer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) served in this parliament in opposition for many years. They observed the deregulation of industry, but they realised that reform of the workplace was necessary to complete the competition puzzle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They argued for change as successive Labor governments turned down their hearing aids and propagated their faith in the accord. The wise heads in the Labor Party who had seen how the Whitlam government had been treated by the unions, their friends, knew they needed a sop. Accord mark 1 was cooked up to keep the Hawke government out of trouble. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Then we had accord marks 2, 3, 4, 5, et cetera. The 1980s gave way to the 1990s. The world was rapidly changing and Australia lived through a whole series of these deals that only served to mark time. Labor was the government of the day and they set the policy agenda. That was their right. They lived by it, and in the end they died by it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very sad to see the complete disregard for the will of the people shown by those opposite. On 2 March, the people said, `You've been in government a long while; step aside and give someone else a shot at running this country,' although many on this side of the House would say that they said it in stronger terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite this, it seems that those opposite would like to freeze the legislation, as if they left Australia a perfect place, and wish that their utopia remain intact when they return to office. But I am not sure whether any known freezing agent has a lifespan to last as long as they will be in opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard many times about the proud history of the Australian Labor Party. If they continue down their current road, they will have more of a past than they do a future. Those in the other place are similarly petulant. Already they have swept the part&hyphen;privatisation of Telstra under the rug and stalled the biggest environmental package in Australia's history. Now they are making decisions about this vital legislation before it has even reached them from this House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We no longer hear too much from the Labor Party about the primacy of the House of Representatives. It was one of former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam's oft quoted nostra that `the people's house, democratically elected, should set the agenda and not the other place'. Yet now we see the opposition being held captive by the minority players in this debate. It must surely hurt those who have built the Labor Party into the considerable force that it once was&mdash;just as surely as delaying this initiative will truly hurt the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The virtues of reform and preparing ourselves for a new century have long been extolled by many on both sides of politics. We have freed up so many of our industries, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2855"> smartened up so many of our practices and attempted to ensure that Australia is ready to go into the new world economy. Sustainable growth, low inflation, international competitiveness and more jobs are objectives long aspired to by all Australians, but we will never get there without real reform in the workplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us establish one fact. The refusal of those opposite to support us in our endeavours is not ground in ideological difference, because previous Labor governments have already dabbled in workplace agreements; nor is it from any conviction that this bill will in any way hurt the Australian people. Their opposition comes from sheer bloody&hyphen;mindedness as well as their unswerving fealty to the unions which provide the financial backbone for Labor's election campaigns.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the amendments moved by the honourable member for Canberra (Mr McMullan). I will be speaking in general terms in support of those amendments. The Labor opposition's amendments to the objectives of the bill go to a number of points. They go to fairness and equity, particularly in relation to women and the right of employees to organise and bargain collectively. In fact, the amendments put some teeth into the legislation to protect working people. This is seriously missing in the legislation that the government has put forward.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, I want to refer to clause 3(a) under the objectives of the bill, as put forward by the government. The principal object is, through a fair and flexible labour market, that of encouraging the pursuit of high employment, improved living standards, better pay, low inflation and international competitiveness through higher productivity. I express my sincere doubts about the ability to achieve any of these under the present government's legislation. The labour market in the main is very unfair, and this legislation will only make it more unfair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The need for flexibility has always been the argument raised by employers when they want workers to work harder and longer for less hourly pay. Of course, one gets better pay if one works longer, but what price is the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> worker going to pay? The workers want improved living standards. Who doesn't? But what are they going to be forced to endure to get some miserable improvement in what they now have?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suggest that there will be not an improvement but a regression to the bad old days. Many members would not be sitting where they are today if it had not been for the work of hardworking trade unionists who have made this country one where education, good jobs and the ability to own your own home are available to all of us. A number of members opposite have said that their fathers influenced them into joining a trade union. This is very good. If our predecessors in the trade union movement had not made great sacrifices for all of us, we would never have been able to raise ourselves to our present positions. But we are the lucky ones. Many working people, through no fault of their own but because of sickness and unemployment, are still experiencing economic hardship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill will have an adverse effect on the workers of Australia if it is not carried with proper and substantial amendments, as are being suggested by the Labor opposition. The catchcry of the ideologues of the coalition is always, `Let us achieve international competitiveness.' So it is added to the objects. But international competitiveness is one of the objectives of the present bill. What does the government try to do? They really mean: let everyone else in the working class work their hearts out with very little compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you have uncertain employment, you have uncertain entitlements; you have no long service leave, no holiday loading and no annual leave. It is the blue&hyphen;collar worker, whom this government claims as its new&hyphen;found supporter, who will lose most from this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of us are fortunate enough not to have had the sort of experience handed to us second&hyphen;hand. Some of us remember how our parents were treated and how difficult it was for them to not only feed their kids but also educate and clothe them. We remember our fathers and mothers struggling home in the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2856"> dark on weekends from work, summer and winter&mdash;and also having to work most of Saturday&mdash;and still on rates of pay that would never allow them to buy a home or take a holiday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was pressure on family life when there was not enough money to pay the bills. I remember that my father worked long hours as a car spray painter and had little protection from the fumes of the paint he was using. Dad died of cancer, which I believe could have been caused by his working conditions. I recall Mum and Dad working at home at night, making light shades to earn that little bit of extra money. I recall the tension at home as Mum and Dad discussed what bill they should pay first.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government clause drips with hypocrisy. Just like the government's track record to date, it lacks substance, has very little meaning and absolutely nil intent. I urge genuine members on the government side to support the Labor opposition's amendments.</PARA></SPEECH>

Given the palpable anger against Paul Keating and the Labor government amongst shopkeepers and other small businesses, the results were not surprising. In fact, my vocabulary was expanded considerably in reading the opinions expressed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of those surveyed, 85 per cent judged Keating's performance to be poor or disastrous. Respondees also showed low confidence in the future, with resultant implications for employment prospects. Three out of four business owners said that they would either reduce or put on hold increases in staff in the coming year. When asked to rank the most detrimental problems, the overwhelming response was unfair dismissal laws, the second was taxes and charges and the third was interest rates. If I were to conduct another survey in the electorate of Cook today, I believe that the response would be `hopeful, expectant but yet to be convinced'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Members of a local business task force I have convened in my electorate have express ed to me their frustration at things that have not yet happened. They continue to cite unfair dismissal laws as their major bete noire and are looking for relief. Those in the smallest businesses, what we now call the micro sector, wonder why unfair dismissal laws apply to them at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The total package of this bill is obviously a huge step in the correct direction, for which the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) deserves huge credit. If the total package is adopted&mdash;passed through the Senate&mdash;it will obviously serve as an incentive for people to employ workers under flexible arrangements and to expand both productivity and employment. But obviously much more will be needed to convince people in the micro sector to employ anyone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has recently established a micro business consultative group. Wendy Perkins, an enterprising woman and a member of my local business task force, has been appointed to that group. The terms of reference of the group begin with the brief to assess the impact of government policies on micro businesses and end with the direction to prepare strategies to tackle impediments to the establishment and growth of micro businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the initial tasks of the consultative group should be to assess the impact of our new unfair dismissal law&mdash;or its potential impact; the Senate is flexing its obstructionist muscles&mdash;on the confidence and outlook of the micro business sector and whether employers in this sector will suddenly find themselves willing to employ people. At the moment they are not willing to take the risk. They are the geese that lay the golden eggs. And they have stopped laying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to recognise the impact of this legislation on businesses of which the proprietor is not only the owner but also the industrial advocate, the accounts keeper, the front desk, the secretary, the promotions manager, the chief cook and bottle washer and everything else combined.

The distribution of the benefits of growth has been highly uneven, with little impact on the nation's 20 million hungry citizens. Income disparities in the US are the widest for 40 years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Peter Doeringer pointed to the dark side of labor market flexibility, noting increased joblessness and income loss among displaced workers, disruption of career paths for young adults, career disruption for older workers as a result of early terminations <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> . . . Doeringer argues that the enormous amount of workplace turbulence in the US "has disrupted established labor relations practices and potentially weakened human resource development systems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The US Department of Labor Commission on Workforce Quality and Labor Market Efficiency, formed in 1989, expressed concern that short-term responses to turbulence in the workplace would undermine work force productivity.</PARA>
<PARA>Further noting this utopia that some people have put forward, the article read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Real hourly earning of production or nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls, which peaked in 1973 at $8.55 per hour and have been headed downward since, were $7.64 by 1989 and $7.39 in 1993. Labor productivity in the business sector increased at an average rate of 0.8 per cent between 1979 and 1989, compared with an average growth rate of 2.1 per cent . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I will also cite the US labor secretary Robert Reich. We are hearing today promises about this legislation. The pattern that we see in the United States is to question this road. They are questioning the experience that they have been through. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To be sure, in some cases, America's flexibility allows employers to lay off workers or to pay low wages. But that type of flexibility is ultimately foolish, because it succumbs to the diabolical trade-off. It generates additional jobs at the expense of high living standards. The goal must be both, which is why in any advanced economy, the links between citizens and the working world must be strong but supple.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>So we have a situation in the United States at the moment where there is debate in the Congress about the minimum wage. They are questioning this view that all is gained by flexibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the ultimate realities of the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 will be the severe threat to women's conditions. It is not simply the patent repercussions of allowing employers to merrily switch part&hyphen;timers' hours each week as they choose, disrupting home life and child care; there is the overrepresentation of women in the part&hyphen;time and less organised service, clerical and retail sectors. Actually, women constitute two&hyphen;thirds of the part&hyphen;time work force, and over 40 per cent of women employees are in the retail sectors. A simultaneous outcome will be the widening of wage differentials between genders.</PARA>

I would not have thought that sensible, reasonable people would think that they represent a really major shift in terms of Australia's regulation of this thing we call industrial relations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that, for a very long time, we have lived with a very highly detailed, regulated system which has page after page of detailed regulation. The awards sometimes go to hundreds of pages and detail such items as how many flavours of ice&hyphen;cream there should be in the staff canteen. I would have thought that in the latter stages of the 1990s we would be prepared to say, `Hey, most people in industry have grown up a bit.' Businesses recognise that their businesses depend on their people. The biggest asset in most businesses is the people who work for them. It is not their plant and their equipment. It is not their patents. It is not their ideas. It is not their work in progress. It is not their stock. It is their people.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had this paternalistic attitude in Australia for so long that somehow somebody knows better than the individual what is good for the individual, what is good for a business and what is good for the work force in a workplace. That paternalistic attitude has really helped make us as a nation less competitive than otherwise we might have been, and it has helped, I suspect, hold down the number of jobs that are available to Australians. Theoretically, our unemployment would not exist if we had a proper industrial relations system that allowed people to make decisions about their wages and their conditions of employment by themselves without some grandfather up there deciding for them how it must be done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The diatribe that I just listened to absolutely amazed me. The honourable member was talking about the United States of America and the diabolical things that have happened to Americans because they have a lower unemployment rate than Australia and was saying how workers are being decimated by industry as they downsize because of all these terrible things going on but how in Australia we have got it all right. We have got 850,000 people who cannot find a job, no matter what we do. We increase the spending on labour market programs by half a billion dollars a year over two years and that cranks down the unemployment rate.

I am also amazed that there are many members of the government benches so enthusiastic about this legislation's supposed effect on unemployment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In an article headlined, `Reforms no solution for the unemployed' in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 24 May, John Buchanan and Toni O'Loughlin from the Australian Centre for Industrial Relations Research and Training described the effects of a deregulated labour market based on an analysis of the US experience:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some employers attempt to achieve competitive advantage by driving down wages paid to employees. When one employer achieves this, others are forced to follow. The net effect has been the growth of what is known as the working poor with 36 per cent of working Americans earning poverty level wages.</PARA>
<PARA>This argument really makes a mockery of any attempts to link a deregulated labour market <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with job growth. The deregulated labour market is designed to cut the wages of those already in employment, the theory being that lower wages means more jobs.</PARA>
<PARA>As Buchanan and O'Loughlin also state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This theory of the labour market now has few adherents beyond authors of first year micro&hyphen;economic textbooks.</PARA>
<PARA>All evidence suggests that employers put workers on based on the expected demand for their goods, not based on relative wage levels. In fact, cuts to wage levels can dampen demand and further undermine the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill constitutes a rejection of ILO standards in key areas. This aspect has been the subject of some of the most disingenuous babble by members of the coalition. By adhering to international standards, we are told with mock indignation, we are watering down our national sovereignty. These international standards are something to be proud of. Australia's role as a First World nation should be to seek to uphold and promote international standards, not to dilute them behind spurious arguments that they compromise our national sovereignty.  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is a recipe for disaster which should be rejected as fundamentally un&hyphen;Australian. Rather than governing for all, this legislation proves that this is a government for some. The bill contains a number of direct catalysts for industrial confrontation. One of the most important achievements of 13 years of Labor government was that it delivered industrial peace to this nation. The means by which this was delivered was the mechanism of the accord.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the shadow minister for industrial relations has pointed out: the highest number of strikes in any full year under the Labor government was fewer than the lowest number of strikes in any full year of the Fraser&hyphen;Howard government. The abandonment of the accord and the decimation of the role of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission will lead to more confrontation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An important aspect of the accord framework was the notion, largely accepted by the union movement, that their members could be recompensed by means other than directly by <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2860"> wages. Over the life of the Labor government, the accord provided a mechanism for the reward of workers through the tax system and through the social wage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cutting back of conciliatory mechanisms, together with the end of this notion that workers can be rewarded by means other than wage increases, represents a direct encouragement to powerful unions to go into the marketplace to seek large increases. Through the accord during the 1980s and 1990s, organised labour through the ACTU played a crucial role in providing a framework whereby trade unions could collectively acknowledge and serve the national interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the risk of stating the obvious, unions were formed in the interests of their members. Necessarily, they were not formed in the first instance in the national interest. This is a fundamental feature of our pluralist society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the Labor government, and through the accord, the ACTU made a tremendous contribution to the national interest. Under the Howard&hyphen;Reith policy, there is no role for unions in collectively considering what is in the national interest. This represents turning back the clock not just to the dark days of Fraserism but back 100 years. During the 19th century, a significant section of the trade union movement was opposed to the idea of the government regulating industry and providing social services. Their view was that unions should be free to do what they are good at and that was, win improved wages and conditions through their bargaining power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While organised unions and sectors, where they have leverage, can and will seek large increases, this will partly offset the expected savage and unnecessary cuts in the social wage that the government will deliver on budget night. Every dollar that the Treasurer (Mr Costello) takes from the social wage on budget night, powerful unions will seek to get back for their members. In addition, I suspect that powerful unions will also seek increases because they think they can get them.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking on this amendment, I bring to the attention of the House a Mr Grahame Abbott, who resides in my electorate and, like my family tonight, is listening to this speech. Mr Abbott is an employee of Bayswater Colliery based in Muswellbrook in the Upper Hunter Valley. Employed as a production worker, his specific role has him handling heavy earthmoving machinery.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Playing out his case before the Industrial Relations Commission, claiming discrimination against his employer, he consequently lost on a technical point late last week. It is a matter that I have followed with great interest. Indeed, so exasperated is he that he has specifically asked that I tell his side of the story before this House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make it clear what this case symbolises and the reference it has to the Weipa dispute, for it involves the very same trade union body&mdash;the CFMEU. Up until July 1995, Mr Abbott was a member of the CFMEU. He then resigned for reasons relating to the moneys raised and collected from members of the northern region lodge of the union to send to the families of victims of the local community of Moura. On 7 August 1994, a tragic explosion in the No.2 mine killed 11 miners at the BHP site. A sum of $126,000 was raised. However, it took union representatives in excess of three months to distribute the money to the people of Moura. For over three months it sat&mdash;no doubt earning a sizeable interest return&mdash;safely tucked away down at the local bank branch in the CFMEU's account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2861"> We now progress to where the CFMEU and Bayswater Colliery set about signing a new enterprise agreement, an agreement which excluded Mr Abbott and two fellow work colleagues who were no longer part of the union. The Bayswater Colliery Company Enterprise Agreement (1996) was struck between the colliery and the CFMEU on 7 April 1996. The substantial benefits that flowed to its members, and not to Mr Abbott and his colleagues, commenced on 21 May 1996. Part of the agreement included refer ence to a preference clause. Part 22 of this agreement, under the title `Preference to unionists', did just this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Preference shall be given to members of the CFMEU, CEPU and AFMEU who are employed at Bayswater Colliery in relation to engagement in employment, promotion, retention in employment, taking annual leave and long service leave, overtime and vocational training.</PARA>
<PARA>At Weipa, as you may recall, it was not okay that non&hyphen;award employees were treated differently, through contracts of employment, from award employees and members of the CFMEU.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet, at Bayswater the shoe was suddenly on the other foot. Grahame Abbott and his two fellow work colleagues were not members of the CFMEU and were financially out of pocket because of their decision. Perhaps the executives of Bayswater Colliery, fearing another Weipa situation, simply turned a blind eye or the other cheek when they could have pulled out their chequebook.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to draw to your attention an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Newcastle Herald</EMPHASIS> of Monday, 24 June 1996 by Katie Burrows, which succinctly outlines the case. In it, Grahame Abbott's solicitor, Mr David Allen of Maitland, reiterates that his client was losing around $1,500 every 15 weeks. The article outlined that after two hearings the Industrial Relations Commission had ratified the Bayswater Colliery Company Enterprise Agreement 1996, which it did on Thursday, 20 June. I want to briefly quote from the article because it makes a number of telling points on this whole affair. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Allen represented Bayswater production worker Mr Grahame Abbott, who tried to have the enterprise agreement stopped in the IRC, claiming discrimination because as a non-union member he was ineligible to receive it.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Allen was critical of the IRC decision and said he had sent case material to the federal Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Reith, and would also send details to the Senate committee set up to hear submissions on the proposed workplace changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">He described the alleged discrimination against non-union members as a real concern. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">`We're concerned the IRC has relied on a technicality to allow discrimination to continue,' Mr Allen said.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Allen also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This man is committed to work&mdash;that's what he's there for.</PARA>
<PARA>Grahame Abbott's predicted income shortfall since 7 April, based on a weighted average of financial calculations, will see him in arrears by over $7,000 per annum compared with his CFMEU aligned work mates. This is nothing short of a disgrace by any standards. Add to it the legal bills and in effect he is $15,000 out of pocket in his bid to see equal pay for equal work and alleviate alleged discrimination against non-union workers at Bayswater Colliery.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on these amendments as no captive of any policy or ideology&mdash;I was a unionist many years ago, which I abandoned only when I was able to strike my own workplace agreement from a position of strength. I am a little disturbed at the truncation of this debate on such a fundamental change to our workplace and I question the government's commitment to any sort of democratic process in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the accord introduced by the former Labor government achieved an unprecedented period of industrial peace, it largely delivered a real undermining of the rewards those workers enjoyed from their labour. While a deregulated banking system embarked on a drunken orgy of lending that aided and abetted a bunch of corporate rip-off merchants, largely at the expense of small investors, the work force's real wages and share of profits declined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the regime of privatisation, downsizing and corporatisation that accompanied this financial deregulation, the benefits of commerce have largely percolated to the top. Now, with all the indicators pointing towards higher levels of unemployment, the government's new legislation appears to me to largely disadvantage the employee, particularly the emasculation of the Industrial Relations Commission and the insertion of an Employment Advocate whose role is not transparently objective. The union movement <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2862"> has been weakened by the accord process. Union membership is very low, new jobs are largely part&hyphen;time or casual and there is little inclination by part-time workers, mainly women, to join unions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I see elements in this bill which address the monopolistic and irrelevant amalgamation of unions. I applaud those sections of the bill that facilitate disamalgamation. I also applaud the reform of the unfair dismissal laws, but this bill is not only about them. Many workers have seen unions become less and less relevant while the union bosses have cemented their positions. But that is no argument for throwing out collective bargaining.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any assessment of our labour market in recent years shows a gradual decline in the participation rate of males in the work force, due largely to structural unemployment caused by a massive reduction in manufacturing. Poor labour mobility has inhibited the movement of labour and its absorption into areas of growth. On latest estimates, structural unemployment is as high as five per cent and six per cent. In this climate, to introduce a system that leaves the employee largely at the mercy of the hirer of labour is to deny any suggestion of a level playing field. I have seen this in my own electorate where the policy of downsizing and corporatisation of the Commonwealth-owned Australian Defence Industries in Lithgow, the old small arms factory, has seen 800 jobs discarded over the past 13 years of Labor government: this by a government allegedly concerned about the manufacturing work force. As the commentator B.A. Santamaria&mdash;I don't always agree with him&mdash;points out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the abuses of union leaders over the years are on the record, it is a distortion to use the undoubted abuses of unionism to support the destruction of unionism itself! Even worse abuses were perpetrated by the banks in the 80s but nobody has proposed depriving the banks of the privileges accorded them under the various banking acts because they racked up $30 billion in bad debts.</PARA>
<PARA>We have evolved a work culture in this country that has been based on an umpire and a transparently fair judgment of an employee's worth and an employer's responsibilities. It is part of our `fair go, mate' culture <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and it's still very real but at risk from socially divisive economic and industrial policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This has been modified in recent years to adequately cater for those who do not wish to be part of a union and who wish to strike up workplace agreements. I have done that for many years in my own case. I have negotiated the same with people I have employed&mdash;flexible agreements to meet the needs of a flexible workplace. But such agreements have always been between highly skilled people whose skills are in great demand and who could not be easily replaced from a pool of available labour. I have also accepted the award conditions for those others in a weaker bargaining position and this has delivered increasing profits to a television industry in the middle of a rural recession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will not immediately transform the workplace to non-union and non-award, but it's a step in that direction. I believe it will impact unfairly on the small and vulnerable sectors of the Australian work force which is made up of people prepared to give a fair day's work for a fair day's pay. But that fairness&mdash;the input and the reward&mdash;must be determined on a truly level playing field and I don't think, overall, this bill provides that.</PARA></SPEECH>

In some respects I am sorry that I can speak to this bill for only five minutes, but the opportunity is there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Greenway (Mr Mossfield), with the greatest respect, was talking about uncertainty. The only uncertainty in this debate is the level to which the opposition will sink to protect its absolutely and totally outdated view of this country. The objects of this legislation are about jobs, jobs, jobs&mdash;no more, no less. The interesting part is that we have not heard one admission from the members on the other side about what happened on 2 March.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every member in this chamber knows that on 2 March the Australian people were fully aware of the coalition's proposed industrial <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2863"> relations legislation. The member for Greenway said, `We found the blue&hyphen;collar workers,' but I can tell him that the blue-collar workers of Australia found us, and they will stay with us. They knew when the polls opened at 8 a.m. on 2 March what we proposed to do as far as industrial relations was concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The comments from members like the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) and others from the New South Wales Right, the younger ones, were particularly revealing. I am afraid that the latest litter whelped by the New South Wales Right show that they possess the same flawed ideology as the tired and toothless group that appear to be their mentors. I am afraid that, until we get some sense from the opposition in relation to this, the Australian community will treat them as the irrelevant players they are in the current political process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot believe you have the gall to come into this House having been thrashed on 2 March by a perceptive community that knew you were bad news, that knew you have been bad news for the last 13 years and that knew you would have been bad news if you had been re&hyphen;elected.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted that the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) has returned to the House. It is obvious that the member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) was not here to hear what he had to say earlier. I thank the member for Paterson for his contribution to this debate because he has just exposed this workplace relations bill for exactly what it is. This bill is not about jobs. This bill is not about productivity. This bill is not based on economic grounds. This bill is purely and simply about getting the unions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Paterson chose to highlight the CFMEU because an attack on the CFMEU is like an aphrodisiac to members of the Liberal Party. Nothing could be more enjoyable for them than to attack such a successful union as the CFMEU. The CFMEU has done a terrible thing: through the provision of collective bargaining, we no longer have coalminers shot at places like Rothbury and we now have decent working conditions for our coalminers in the Hunter. I would have thought that being from the Hunter, and being someone who I know must recognise the significance of the coalmining industry to the Hunter, the member for Paterson would have been in here defending the coalmining industry, not attempting to bring it down by supporting this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As has been so well articulated by many members on this side during the second reading debate, this bill has many flaws. The most important flaw of all is the bill's departure from the cooperative approach taken by the previous Labor government. That cooperative approach has helped to create 1.6 million jobs in this country over the last 13 years. The cooperative approach has reduced days lost due to industrial dispute from more than 700 days per year 15 years ago to only 100 <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2864"> days per year in 1995. It is a system that has delivered a low inflation and low interest rate economy and is delivering for this country sustainable economic growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the limited time still available to me&mdash;and I am outraged to have been denied an opportunity to make a contribution to this bill during its second reading stage&mdash;I will concentrate for a moment on the coalmining industry. Spurred on by recent coal price increases and a surging demand for thermal coal, the coal industry has the world at its feet. Add to that, of course, a healthy industrial environment, and the coalmining industry stands to reap enormous benefits for this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The imminent boom is good news for employers and employees alike. Large companies like BHP, Shell and CRA are already undermining the position of miners in anticipation of the passing of this legislation. At BHP's Mount Owen mine in the Upper Hunter, more than 70 members of the coalmining union have already received their retrenchment notices. What has happened at Mount Owen is that a new contractor has been engaged; Theiss has decided to lay off all mineworkers on that site and re&hyphen;recruit. This action runs contrary to a longstanding understanding and practice in the industry that `new contractors shall retain existing staff'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This would not be happening if the acceptance of this legislation was not imminent. This is a sign of things to come. We will be seeing many more industrial disputes in the coalmining industry in the Hunter&mdash;and this can only be bad news not only for the Hunter but for Australia generally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The CFMEU and the maritime unions have already foreshadowed their preparedness to fight. Honourable members opposite will say, `Well, that's disgraceful,' and, `That's irresponsible.' Let me share with honourable members what John Maitland, the president of the mineworkers union, recently had to say:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am grateful for the opportunity to continue my remarks on the Australian Labor Party's first amendment to the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1966. This amendment deals with the objects of the act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we view this legislation against the background of thought that existed in the early part of this century, it may seem a radical departure from those ideas&mdash;but it is not. The concept of needs and ability to pay are considered as they were by Mr Justice Higgins in the Harvester decision in 1907. The needs requirement will be met by the awards; and the ability to pay will be determined by performance and productivity, to be covered in workplace agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation will change forever the role of the union movement. Alan Wood, whom I will quote later this evening, concluded that unions have spent years ignoring their members' interests and, forced to compete in a fair contest, are going to lose. There will undoubtedly be a place in Australian society for the trade union movement. That place, however, will no longer be in the middle, attempting to thwart the wishes of employer and employee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Organised labour will need to reinvent itself and begin to place its own interests behind those it claims to represent. It will need to become as competitive as, and in a similar manner to, our successful businesses. It will need to offer a decent product at a decent price. It may take time for attitudes and old habits to change, but I am sure that the trade union movement has something to offer the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2865"> Australian people. Its members will be the final arbiters on that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this bill the coalition is keeping faith with its commitment to the blue-collar workers who believe that the coalition parties would best represent their interests and ensure no dilution of their wages and conditions. The times do not allow Australia to live in a vacuum. Either we push forward now, looking confidently to the future, or at we will surely be dragged into the future, kicking and screaming. How quickly we respond to changed circumstance is a measure of the maturity of our country as a nation. Very few conditions have changed as greatly as the needs in the workplace. Our response is long overdue, but it is better late than never.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to congratulate my friend the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) on this bill. If he does nothing else in his term as a minister&mdash;and that, I think, is highly unlikely&mdash;he will be remembered for this piece of legislation. Further, the legislation itself will be remembered as a great achievement for both the government and the minister. The minister has laid all his cards on the table, as predicted in the coalition's election promise. There are no hidden agendas, no aces up his sleeve.

Some government speakers have spoken of this as a piece of legislation which lives up to coalition promises. In fact, it does nothing of the sort.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The primary coalition promise was to govern for all of us. This is not a bill of that character; this is a bill for some of us. It is not a bill for those who belong to trade unions and whose rights are being restricted by the provisions of this legislation, particularly with things such as rights of entry. This is not a bill for young people, whose wages can be reduced to as low as $3.05 per hour by <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> misuse of the provisions for on-the-job training. This is not a bill for women, whose lives and whose families' lives will be adversely affected by the removal of restrictions on the predictability of work times, and whose incomes are likely to suffer, given that under award structures they have traditionally done better than under over&hyphen;award structures. This is not a bill for shift workers or weekend workers, who will lose their penalties, overtime payments and the like.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a bill for those employers who are unscrupulous. It is not a bill for the more scrupulous employers whose standards will inevitably fall to meet the labour costs of unscrupulous employers. It is also a bill for militant unions. It is not a bill which supports ordinary workers and workers whose industrial muscle is not so great.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) referred to `jobs, jobs, jobs'. The problem with that reference is that the job creation rate of the Labor government was considerably faster than the job creation rate of the Fraser government with the present Prime Minister (Mr Howard) as Treasurer. I further draw the attention of the member for Ballarat to the fact that there are many provisions in this bill which were not disclosed prior to the election outcome, such as those which restrict union rights of entry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fundamentally, this bill reflects a view of the workplace on the part of the Liberal Party which it has always had which I think can be regarded, on the one hand, as naive or, on the other, as sinister, depending on which way you choose to characterise it. Invariably, the Liberal Party has viewed the workplace as a place of direct negotiation between employer and employee. We have heard a lot of talk in recent years about enterprise bargaining from both sides of the House. The critical difference has been that the Labor view of enterprise bargaining involves a role for unions and a role for the Industrial Relations Commission while the government side of the House says that effectively what we want is simple direct bargaining between employers and employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I characterise that, on the one hand, as being naive because the reality of life at the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2866"> workplace is that employers hold the aces. In effect, they say to you, `If you want the job, you sign the contract at this rate of pay and under these conditions of service.' That view ignores the reality of life in the workplace. It ignores the lessons of history. It is precisely because employees were exploited that trade unions developed, that that essential umpire developed and, indeed, that the Labor Party developed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also ignores the lessons of experience in overseas countries where the more deregulated labour market model has been tried. It is already clear that in those countries wages and conditions of employment have tended to decline, whereas in Australia we have been able to retain, in terms of income differentials, a much better outcome than those countries which do not have the role for trade unions and the role of the central umpire which we have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also think this can be characterised as sinister in the sense that it is my view that the Liberal Party always looks after those in society who are better off and who are already advantaged. It has been the tradition of the Labor Party to look after those who are less well off. This is a bill and these are a set of objects from the government which is from that tradition where wealth and power are likely to gravitate towards those employers who are already well off and be taken away from those employees who are less well off.

I am absolutely surprised at the level of hypocrisy displayed by members on the opposition benches, in particular, the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon). He stands up here yelling and screaming and carrying on about support for the coalmining industry, but let us have a look at what they have done to it. They have let the coalmining industry down. They have discriminated against workers. As I said before, they discriminated against Mr Grahame Abbott because he dared to resign from one union to go across to another union and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> work out an enterprise agreement of his own.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we had the member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins), who spoke so highly of the accord&mdash;the accord that has failed everyone. It is a system whereby you are not allowed to go outside the protective union and ask for what you want as an individual in the workplace. Whatever happened to reward for effort? If you put in a little more effort than someone else, you are not allowed to get paid any more. You are penalised for it. You are pushed out. But that is what they want. They talk about equality&mdash;equality for all, except for the union bosses. No, they are a different breed from which people are selected and brought into this House.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we had the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson), who wanted to talk about the views of the Liberal Party.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a look at the ideals of Labor who claim to look after those who are less well off. I can understand Labor's ideals because, quite simply, after the last 13 years they have put them in that position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there was ever a time when there must be freedom of choice in the labour market, without discrimination as to whether a person chooses to be a union member and, if so, which union, then this is the time. If there was ever a time for altering an industrial system that requires employees to seek legal action against their employers and former employers to obtain a basic right of fair and equal treatment in the workplace, then this is the time. If ever there was a time when we needed to install this legislation, then it is right now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me point out to you that on the ABC <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program just over a week ago the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) said&mdash;and it is something that should be considered, `What's more important&mdash;the people, the workers or the functionaries of the system?' The proof of this policy is definitely in the eating.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just wanted to say a couple of things as we have had an extended debate about these amendments. Whilst I dismiss much of the hyperbole that has been presented tonight, particularly by the opposition, there are a couple of issues which I want to raise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first is to make a more general statement and that is to say that, yes, we are moving towards a more deregulated labour market in Australia. We are not moving to the United States model. The fact is we are keeping the uniquely Australian system of awards. We are keeping the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Yes, we are making changes to the commission and we think its role should be changed. In some areas we are actually enhancing the role of the commission. I think that will provide positive benefits to the system that we are designing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those who are seemingly suggesting that we should not be deregulating further, the truth of the matter is that on both sides of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> politics there has been a recognition that we need to. The reason is that pressure is on us to deregulate and search for a more efficient system so that people can enjoy higher pay in the future. In many cases the pressures for that further deregulation in the system have been the competitive pressures sometimes flowing from government decisions. The tariff reductions in the 1980s was one such very important decision made by the previous government, which we supported. There is no doubt that it set up a reaction in our businesses as they have had to adapt to meet that greater competition. That has basically been a good thing for the Australian economy. It allows us, over time&mdash;if we were able to move further and faster, as we are proposing in this legislation compared to the previous government&mdash;to give the Australian economy a much greater capacity to deal with some of the fundamental structural problems that we have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Going from that broader issue, which I think colours the views and contributions of people such as the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), we are going to a more decentralised system. But I wonder whether she and some others in the Labor opposition are actually hankering for a more centralised system. If they are, they are out of sync with the shadow minister for industrial relations and certainly out of touch with the policy development of the previous Labor government. That does not surprise me; I think there are elements within the Labor Party that will want to revert to a more centralised system. I do not think it is a policy position that is in any way tenable. It is really contradicted by the development of the system, however slow it may have been&mdash;even under Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When it comes to the effect on women, the point to emphasise is that we are maintaining a lot of protection for people in the system, including women. Honourable members opposite have been talking about the equal pay principle. We support the equal pay principle. We think it is a very important principle. We have backed up our support for that principle by, for example, requiring the Industrial Relations Commission in its award making function to apply that principle to its <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2868"> work. We have also required the commission, in its function to certify agreements, to ensure that agreements also meet that principle. Likewise, with Australian workplace agreements, it is a minimum condition. Under the umbrella of the commission and in respect of Australian workplace agreements, we have upheld the principle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an issue about the over&hyphen;award area, but that is not an issue about the principle. We support the principle. It is simply a question of process. Our argument is that the better process is for complaints in the over&hyphen;award area to go to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. That process was supported in a report of the sex discrimination commissioner in 1992. We are not arguing about the principle; it is simply a matter of process in only one aspect of it. Whatever your views on it, I do not think it is arguable that we are in any way walking away from the principle. We are not; we are supporting it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had a lot of discussions with women's groups. We took on board a lot of their suggestions and made sure that this bill properly implemented and provided protection for women, particularly on the question of equal pay. I hope to say something about the part-time issue later because, again, we will provide real benefits for women. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not wish to speak for long. There has been a very wide-ranging discussion about these amendments and I wanted to make two points about the debate. I want to thank a number of my colleagues who either wished to speak more than once and had accepted my capacity to nail their foot to the floor, or who accepted that, even though they were not able to speak on the second reading debate, they would not participate in order to  facilitate the smooth flow of the debate. I thank them for that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of other matters about these objects which I wished to speak about, but I will not take the time of the House to do it now. I hope we will get the chance to do it in consideration of other amendments. I will mention two briefly. One is our concern about <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the significant reduction in the role of the Industrial Relations Commission&mdash;the so-called 36 reductions in the powers of the Industrial Relations Commission, which I outlined in a press release previously and which have caused me and many others grave concerns. That will be a matter which we will continue to pursue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second is the limitation on the award system. It is true, as the minister says, that the award system has been retained. It has been retained not only as a safety net but as a safety net set too low and strung too narrowly. Therefore, we feel that too many people will fall through or beside the safety net and fail to gain the benefits of it or who will fall to a level lower than that which we feel is appropriate. I hope we get a chance to talk about the award system in the series of amendments to schedule 5. To enable us to do that, I will not say any more about these amendments. Hopefully, we can get them to the vote.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Schedule 1, item 1, page 3 (line 29), before "minimum", insert "fair". <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>By inserting the word `fair' in the proposed object of the act which deals with the award safety net, the government is emphasising its intention that an effective award safety net be comprised of fair minimum wages and conditions of employment. Amending the proposed objects in this way does no more than bring them into line with proposed section 88B, item 7 of schedule 5, which provides that in performing its functions the commission must ensure that a safety net of fair minimum wages and conditions of employment is established and maintained. Section 88B also requires that, in establishing and maintaining the safety net, the commission must have regard to the need to provide fair minimum standards for employees in the context of living standards generally prevailing in the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On this question of fairness, I also take the opportunity to say something about the question of part&hyphen;time work. The essential allegation, or perhaps less emphatically, the stated concern of some is that the proposals we are putting in respect of part&hyphen;time work are in some way unfair. In fact, I think the situation is to the contrary. The reason I say that is that if you listen to the concerns of the opposition, they say that employees may find themselves at the whim of an employer, so much so that the employer dictates the times at which they may be required to work&mdash;an hour here, an hour there, irregular work, unpredictable work&mdash;and that such a situation makes it very difficult for people to match their family and work responsibilities. If that were the case, I would have to say that I would agree with them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The irony is, though, that the very concerns which opposition members reflect on this matter are fair concerns in respect of people who are employed casually. That happens today in the work force. We have seen an explosion in the number of people who are employed as casuals in the Australian work force. The number is now very considerable indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have been concerned about that and for that reason we are moving amendments in respect of part&hyphen;time work to remove the restrictions on the availability of it. But if you <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2870"> look at the allowable matters in the objects of the act&mdash;and I will come to the specifics of it in due course&mdash;we are talking about regular part&hyphen;time work. The whole idea is that people can make predictable arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, you may be a student who is able to obtain work on Monday, Wednesday and Friday for three&hyphen;quarters of an hour in the child&hyphen;care centre at the university. In my view, if you can obtain such work and if it is available, you should be able to do so. That would be predictable, regular part&hyphen;time work. Yet the existing award system has a raft of restrictions which prevent people taking up those employment opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rather than us casualising the work force through the part-time measure, the fact is that many people have been forced into casual employment with the very outcomes that you are concerned about. The remedy is in fact permanent part-time work which provides people with regular hours and which also gives them access to pro rata entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Don't let me be misinterpreted. I am not against casual work per se. If people find that convenient to them, that is fine. What I am concerned about is that we have a bias in the system against people who would like part-time work.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope that we will not wind up in a long debate about matters on which we are in agreement. The opposition is not going to oppose this amendment. All it has done is put one word in, and it is a word that makes no practical difference. Simply putting the word `fair' in does not make something fair. It does not inject fairness into these objects; it still fundamentally leaves it out. Obviously, we <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will not vote against the amendment. Why would you say the minimum standards should not be fair? It never occurred to me that the Industrial Relations Commission, in setting its minimum standards, would not assume that that was an implied criterion. We do not have any objection to the amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will just take a minute which I would not otherwise have taken to respond to the point the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) made. The sad thing is that I think he actually believes that all that he says is true and that it will be helpful. I am not convinced in every area that the intention of the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill is quite as honourable as that. In fact, I am fairly certain that in some areas it is not. I think the minister believes that taking away the power for the Industrial Relations Commission to set the criteria under which part-time work might be undertaken in various industries and workplaces will be advantageous to women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that not many of the women's organisations I have spoken to share that view. Nobody I know who has been involved in the process of developing workplace arrangements of that type shares the view that what he is advocating will have the result he wishes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the opposition is suggesting is not that this parliament should pass a law restricting the way in which part-time work should be used, but that the parliament should continue to enable the Industrial Relations Commission, on a case by case basis, and on the basis of assessment of the circumstances industry by industry, circumstance by circumstance, to set criteria that it considers appropriate. Sometimes it will say that there should not be any. In some industries it will say, `This is not appropriate. There shouldn't be any.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am in no doubt&mdash;nobody on this side of the parliament is in any doubt&mdash;that in 10 years time there will be a higher proportion of part-time work than there is now, for two very good reasons: a higher proportion of employees want it and a higher proportion of employers want it. That is not a problem to us. We are not trying to prevent that from <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2871"> happening. We are trying to do two things: first, allow the Industrial Relations Commission to continue the function&mdash;if we must have your system&mdash;at least of setting minimum standards as to how these matters should be conducted, as set out in your proposed new section 89A&mdash;and, second, not to have that limitation that you have put in the subsequent subclauses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our view is that we do not like that proposed new section at all. The effect of our proposal, whether it was directed to that particular subclause or our more sweeping proposition, is that the Industrial Relations Commission ought be able to inquire into cases&mdash;make recommendations about them, make determinations about them&mdash;industry by industry, in a very general way. It is not because we wish to see less part-time work, but because we wish to see the conditions under which it is developed maintained as a fair and reasonable, balanced set of requirements and to ensure that it does not become a vehicle by which those people who need full-time employment become driven to part-time employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us not pretend that there is not a tendency, a capacity and a facility for that to happen. It is the concern that that might happen which has led to the request by employees through their unions for regulation in the past and the decision by the Industrial Relations Commission in some, but not all, circumstances to accede to their request.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is where the distinction is; it is not about whether part-time work is a good idea or a bad idea. I do not want to see the parliament deciding that. I want to see the framework that has traditionally allowed part-time work to develop and flourish&mdash;and it has developed very rapidly in the last few years to the great satisfaction of many people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> When members of the government were in opposition they used to complain that too many of the jobs being created were part-time jobs. It is now a fact that part-time work is a growing part of our workplaces.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This amendment seeks to add the word `fair' to the clause under the heading `The principal object of the act' which says, `providing the means to ensure that there is an effective award safety net of minimum wages and conditions of employment'. I am glad that the opposition approves of this amendment. I think it is important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a whole range of mechanisms that could have been adopted by the government in considering how to set minimum standards of employment, both wages and particular conditions. This issue goes to the heart of how you go about giving protection to people in a fair and reasonable modern society when you go to remove regulation from a system that has been highly regulated for a very long time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not that this bill seeks to totally deregulate the industrial relations market or the labour market, because it does not. In essence it creates two sorts of bargaining streams. It leaves in place a collective bargaining stream which will still be as it is today&mdash;largely between employers and their representatives, employer associations, and employees and their representatives, trade unions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That bargaining structure is not going to change substantially, as I see it, except to the extent that we are going to ask the parties to take more responsibility for determining the outcomes rather than leaving the outcomes with a third party, the Industrial Relations Commission, a court, to interpose between the parties in an artificial sense, if you will. That part of the bargaining stream is intended to remove a lot of the confrontation that has been inherent in the system that we have had for a very long time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that we leave with the commission the role of setting minimum standards. We could have done it in another way. Those minimum standards of employment could have been set by statute. The parliament could have decided what is a fair hourly rate for a minimum wage. The parliament could have decided what are fair working hours. The parliament could have decided <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2872"> how much sick leave, how much annual leave and how many holidays we will have away from work because of national celebration. The parliament could have decided all those things. It could have made decisions about paternity leave and maternity leave.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Alternatively, the minimums could have been set by statute in another way and been related to something like average weekly earnings. Our pension system is tied to the average male weekly earnings. We could have had a similar mechanism and ensconced it in regulation within the Workplace Relations Act and used that as the basis for fair minimum hourly rates. We could have done what the United States did many years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some speakers on the other side talked about how diabolical the system was in the United States and where everything was going there. The United States Congress sets a minimum hourly rate, which is really an absolute bottom rate, and you cannot pay anybody less than that. It is not very high. Those opposite would not want to try to live on it and neither would I. I grant you that. I am not saying it is the best system, but we could have done that. The point is that we did not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We decided to put in a system to allow the Industrial Relations Commission to set fair and reasonable minimum standards across a range of items which Australians consider are an important part of their standard of living and their lifestyle. If you will, they are more than just part of history; they are part of our culture. This clause is all about allowing fair and reasonable minimum standards to be set and a fair and reasonable minimum wage to be set. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill will deliver a fair deal for Australia's families. Nobody believes more than I do that women have every right to pursue their goals and aspirations in the workplace, indeed as I have. But the forgotten victims in the race that men and women participate in for the benefits that a career brings are our children.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Children generally have two parents, whether they live with them both or not. The belief <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that children are brought up by their mothers in the home behind the picket fence is a creation of the family hostel post&hyphen;industrialised world. It is a situation that both employers and the union movement have not paid appropriate attention to in the past. The reforms laid out in this bill give them the opportunity to do so now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Children are the losers when they are denied the opportunity to develop closer relationships with their fathers because their fathers are absent from the home nine to 10 hours a day, five days a week, earning an income. As of January 1996, only 10 per cent of men in the paid work force were working part&hyphen;time, thus denying the vast majority of working men the opportunity to be more involved in the lives of their children. This compares with the part&hyphen;time participation rate of 42 per cent for women. Increasingly these days, too many children miss out altogether on developing a relationship with their mothers and fathers because they are both heavily occupied earning incomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill sets the framework whereby both parents can choose how they share the income earning responsibilities and the child rearing responsibilities through the opportunities it offers to reach agreements on flexible working conditions. I hope, perhaps in vain, that more fathers of young children will rise to the challenge that the bill offers them&mdash;that is, to spend more time with their children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The removal of restrictions on part&hyphen;time positions will benefit families with children in that they can reach agreements that will deliver certainty in family life. Certainty in terms of a regular wage and regular conditions, including regular hours, is something that far too many employees with family responsibilities who are currently forced into casual arrangements do not currently have. It is absurd to suggest, as those on the other side often do, that employees will be forced to agree to working an hour here and an hour there. Employees will not have to agree to anything they do not want and anything that does not suit their family life and they will be backed up by the Employment Advocate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The flexible agreements provide benefits to employers as well. Employers benefit when <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2873"> they regard their employees as whole people who have lives outside of the workplace, as those lives bring with them certain responsibilities. When employees have their minds on the job and are treated on just terms, they are more productive and their employer is therefore able to satisfy his or her profit and/or efficiency margins more effectively. It makes good economic sense for employers to reach mutually rewarding agreements with their employees concerning wages and conditions that are suitable to both. You have to keep in mind that you cannot reach an agreement that does not satisfy the minimum conditions stated in the award.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said in my first speech in this House, many companies operating in Australia are now placing family friendly work practices very high on their agendas. This bill  further assists them to reach family friendly arrangements with their employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At this point I would like to pay tribute to Dr Don Edgar, previously Director of the Institute for Family Studies. He left the institute to work on a project called Newlinks, which seeks to promote the concept of family friendly workplaces to employers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the social sciences there is an increasing concern over the correlation between historic and fierce work practices and stresses and dysfunction in the family. These problems can be eased through the introduction of family friendly workplaces. At no time is such easing more important than when young children are involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cultural hangovers of the past that are still being expressed by members opposite are unfortunate obstacles to healthier family relationships and improved productivity. The opportunity for the expansion of permanent part&hyphen;time work inherent in this bill should be seen as a very attractive option for all parents as they move through the child&hyphen;rearing years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In order for families to benefit from this bill&mdash;compared with the present system the only possibility is to benefit from this bill&mdash;they must be made aware of the opportunities that it presents them. I intend to inform the families of my electorate and, indeed, wherever possible the families of Australia, that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> they can benefit from the measures that the passing of this bill will offer them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also very pleased with the willingness of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) to incorporate organisations like the Working Women's Centre in my home state of South Australia. The capacity of organisations like theirs to empower women with family responsibilities by giving information assistance to them is critical in the success of the new arrangements. I urge members opposite and those who sit in the other place to look beyond the ancient framework built by the dinosaurs of days long gone and to put their energy into the building of a structure whose potential to assist families is greater than that ever before put to this House. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to spend a few minutes speaking about these objectives, including what I view as some very serious shortcomings throughout the act. I have already made my views clear in the second reading stage, but I want to highlight a couple of points that have been the subject of discussion this evening and which I think deserve to be underlined. I have had very strong representations from women's organisations, representations which I know have been made to the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith). I do not think it fair to dismiss those views, because a great many of them are seriously and very strongly held.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some 30 organisations as recently as the 24th said that they were very concerned that the legislation in all of its elements&mdash;the objects and the proposals&mdash;narrowed the definition of equal pay, stripped the awards to a bare minimum which they found unacceptable, and actively promoted non&hyphen;union individual agreements as a basis for employment conditions. International evidence shows very clearly that that is inimical to women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They also indicated that they were very concerned about the removal of special requirements to consult with and inform disadvantaged groups in the workplace. They are all very serious concerns. They were also reflected by 47 of the 49 groups which met at the women's round table. It may for the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2874"> moment be sufficient for the minister to dismiss these concerns&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XS4">Dr LAWRENCE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;or at least not to take them into account and to assume that they are ill&hyphen;informed or wrong in some respect. If the minister believes these organisations to be totally misled, misinformed and wrong, he has a responsibility to sit down with them and talk to them about how that is true and, indeed, to seek to accommodate their concerns.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">International evidence actually supports their views. Where you have systems that are very deregulated, with low levels of central regulation and large levels of individual contracts, their concerns are borne out. Not only do wage levels for women reduce but women are also forced to trade off a large number of conditions in the workplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although the minister responsible continues to insist that women will be among the major beneficiaries, this view has now been explicitly rejected by quite a large number of observers, including those women's groups. In a letter to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, the Labour and Industry Research Unit at the University of Queensland explicitly rejected the minister's claims as both illogical and unsupported by any evidence at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at the wording of the bill, including its objectives, you can see partly why these organisations and academics have reached the conclusion that they have. We are given a pretty clear idea of what the bill is designed to achieve. First of all, it places undue emphasis on economic objectives, as opposed to balanced economic and social objectives. In the past we have had at the cornerstone of our IR system the notion of the living wage. It was not a bare minimum standard. It was the idea that, through the award system and through a centralised process of bargaining, women particularly and groups that are not well unionised&mdash;we admit and acknowledge&mdash;can get a fair deal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">International evidence shows very clearly that the disparity of the value of women's wages between the individual workplace agreement model and the centralised model is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> as much as 16 per cent. The individual workplace agreements&mdash;there is a lot of evidence on this from New Zealand particularly; the elements of the workplace agreement here would be very similar to that of workplace agreements in New Zealand&mdash;see women trading off those conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Far from having family&hyphen;friendly workplaces, they have workplaces that are, in fact, inimical to the sorts of concerns that were expressed by one of the members previously. I think it is beholden on the minister to really have a look at the effects of deregulation of the labour market. I find the phrase `labour market' very offensive because labour is not a commodity.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not at all. Some level of deregulation and even our own research following the last level of deregulation has shown that women were amongst the potential losers. It had got to the point where I, as minister responsible for the status of women at the time, was very concerned, not only with the centralised system that we had introduced of enterprise bargaining with a very substantial safety net but also with the slippage we were starting to see in some of the state legislation. As you move further and further out into individual workplaces with very little union protection&mdash;which is being stripped away by this bill&mdash;and with very little in the way of award provision and minimal entitlements, then you will find women suffering.

In this country we have the most egalitarian society in the world, although many Australians continue to use outmoded terminology such as `bosses' and `workers'. In this legislation we are attempting to promote a culture of cooperation between all those who share the workplace. We seek an environment where employees can work closely with employers. With this increased cooperation will come increases in productivity and resultant increases in wages.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has made the pledge to the Australian people that no employee will be worse off under this new system. The retention of the award as a safety net guarantees that this will be the case. The revamped awards will be simplified but will continue to spell out minimum wages and conditions. Employees will be able to choose whether to accept the award or whether to negotiate a better deal with their employer. They will be able to choose whether they are represented by a third party which may or may not be a union. The choice on this will be left to the employee, as will the choice of joining a union. The days of `no ticket, no start' are over.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party made much of workplace bargaining during the last campaign. They ran advertisements portraying employees as indentured servants forced to sign contracts by cruel overlords. As with much that emanated from that crumbling government, there was little reality and less truth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under this system, nobody would be forced to sign a contract unless they wanted to because they would be better off.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The AIRC will take submissions from interested parties and will be able to play a conciliatory role in resolving differences between them, though it will have no such role in the determination of enterprise agreements that extend beyond the award.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government proposals in the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 will have a significant impact on women. If we are going to talk about fairness, let us talk about the impact on women. Women have generally relied more on the protection stemming from the system of awards and arbitration than have men. This is because women are more likely to work in labour&hyphen;intensive industries with little industrial muscle and to be employed on a part&hyphen;time or casual basis. The Industrial Relations Commission has played a significant role in reducing the gender gap in award wages. The award system has resulted in a higher female to male wages ratio than in other comparable countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's workplace relations bill is designed to reduce the role of the commission and the award system while putting more emphasis on employers reaching agreement with individual employees. This system will result in reduced wages and conditions, particularly for those workers&mdash;women, people from non&hyphen;English&hyphen;speaking backgrounds and young people&mdash;who rely heavily on award protection. Discrimination in over&hyphen;award payments is a significant source of the gender based pay gap. Women earn only 54 per cent of the over&hyphen;award payments paid to men. </PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5K6">Ms ELLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am talking specifically about fairness&mdash;not about chocolate and vanilla! In particular, they were concerned about the narrowing of the definition of equal pay to include only minimum award pay instead of whole pay; the stripping of awards to a bare minimum number of provisions; the active promotion of secret, non&hyphen;union individual agreements as a basis for employment conditions; the absence of any scrutiny by the Office of the Employment Advocate prior to certification of an Australian workplace agreement to ensure that it meets the minimum safety net standards set out in the bill; the reduction of the safety net standard the IRC is to apply in the case of union negotiated agreements over which it does not have jurisdiction; the removal of special requirements to consult with and inform disadvantaged groups in the workplace about a proposed workplace agreement before it is finalised; and the abolition of paid rates awards and their replacement with minimum rates awards.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> These are concerns that I share.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's proposals go far beyond any mandate for industrial relations reform claimed by the coalition. Many of the changes were not even mentioned by the coalition during the election campaign. How fair is that? Of particular concern to workers in my electorate of Namadgi is the government's proposal to abolish paid rates awards. These awards set actual rates of pay as an alternative to over&hyphen;award payments. The government will abolish the awards by ensuring that the Industrial Relations Commission has no power to make any new paid rates awards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2877"> The abolition of paid rates awards will particularly affect women in the public sector&mdash;nurses, teachers, community service employees and lower and middle&hyphen;ranking public servants&mdash;if, I might add, any public servants are left. These employees are gener ally not in a position to negotiate enterprise agreements because of their employers' dependence on government funding. They will be severely disadvantaged, even if the rates in the current paid rates awards are maintained and frozen in minimum rates awards, as they will be unable to gain wage increases in the future. On this side of the House, we believe that paid rates awards should be allowed where the employer and the employee so desire. This is an important aspect of freedom of choice for employees and employers which this government claims to be promoting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say on behalf of the people in my electorate that the fairness that is claimed by the government in this industrial relations bill is just appalling. It is an absolute abomination for the people in Canberra, including the people in my electorate, and the people in Australia. I very strongly support the amendments from this side of the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No; we have had ongoing discussions with them and I am keen that those consultations continue. Firstly, in response to the rather more extreme remarks about other systems, the fact is we have a uniquely Australian system and we are making changes to the Australian system. We are not introducing the United States system of labour market regulation. Although you might have got on to New Zealand's system, we are not introducing that one either. They abolished awards. We are retaining the commission. We are retaining the system of industrial awards. </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that we are simplifying the award system. Again, whilst the opposition may vehemently oppose that, the fact is that in government the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, was a public advocate of simplifying the award system. In section 150A those opposite had a process for simplifying it. You may still support that process. But you have a long way to go when you realise that the simplification process you had in place has barely simplified awards. It is not a system that is working. If you talk to the players and those involved with the simplification process, you will find out it is basically not happening. It has come to a standstill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have therefore proceeded to set out a framework within which the simplification process can proceed under the supervision of the commission and with a guarantee that it will not be a device to reduce wages. That is not gutting the commission, which is what some on the other side like to say. It is not. It is simplifying the award system. The truth is that in a series of measures we are retaining the commission and, as I said before, enhancing it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of the part-time situation, one thing I want to acknowledge is that I think the shadow minister for industrial relations, the member for Canberra (Mr McMullan), who is at the table, by not pressing his argument about regular part-time work, may now have at least realised that regular part-time work is what we are talking about. This is a very important point. It is in the bill. I refer the shadow minister to allowable award matters, 89A, which says `type of employment, such as full-time employment, casual employment, regular part-time employment and shift work'. So that is the answer to those who say this is just going to leave things to the whim of the employer. The fact is that it is an allowable award matter and we have made specific provision for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those who say casual employment is not an issue, a problem or otherwise, the fact is that under the former ALP government there was a very big increase in part-time and casual work. Casual work accounted for about 17 per cent of employees in 1986 but grew to 24 per cent of employees in 1995. That is an <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2878"> explosion in the number of people in casual employment. The reason for that is the many restrictions on part-time work.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The shadow minister says industry is changing and the like. Obviously it is. But what he is proposing is that the commission be able to impose restrictions on part-time work. His argument, as I understand it, is that employers are going to push people out of full-time work into part-time work. Why would an employer do that? Part&hyphen;time work provides pro rata benefits, so it would be of no benefit for an employer to do that. In fact, those opposite have been pushing people into casual employment anyway, so I do not think that argument holds much water.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have still failed to come to grips with the simple proposition that, if people want to work part time and providing it is regular and there is a decent set of minimum conditions, people should be able to make that choice.

Why have any of this stuff? You would just <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> say, `Why don't you all just wander out and come to agreements. It'll be fine.' It is because we do not accept that view&mdash;and the government does not accept that view; it does not advocate that view&mdash;that we have this minimum standard, this array of minima. Our concern is: are they sufficient and are they adequately spelt out? Our view is: no.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There seem to me to be some very strange things in the way this part-time employment issue is addressed in the workplace relations bill. I want to ask a couple of questions about it, although it may not be appropriate, given the time, for the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) to respond now. I am not going to be pursuing it in that way at this moment&mdash;although if he wishes to I am happy to pursue it&mdash;as there will be plenty more opportunities for it to be debated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have suddenly had this enthusiasm that we have had for many years in awards and industrial relations law for the concept of part-time employment. We have suddenly put the word `regular' in front of the phrase `part-time employment'. And this is supposed to be a breathtaking change. It is not `part-time employment' anymore; it is `regular part-time employment'. I am assuming we now do not have three streams&mdash;regular part-time, other part-time and casual. I assume that what we have always called `part-time employment' is now, for the want of better presentation of the argument, called `regular part-time employment'. Beyond that, the word `regular' has absolutely no meaning in there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to refer to subsection (2) of 89A, which is not what we are dealing with but it is the only chance we are going to get to speak about it, and it is what we have been talking about so I am not straying any further than anybody else&mdash;and I appreciate you, Mr Deputy Speaker, letting us all do it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Subsection (2) of proposed new section 89A says that the Industrial Relations Commission can set minimum standards for regular part-time employment. It is not absolutely clear how they will do that, but it is open to them, I assume, to interpret that. And it is not absolutely clear as to the way in which they will set those minimum standards, and the extent to which they will choose to see that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2879"> as an opening for them to set regulations concerning what constitutes regular part-time employment. All that is quite fine. We do not think we should have this limitation on what the Industrial Relations Commission can deal with, and we will come back to that in another debate at another time. The problem is that we have subsection (4), which aims to constrain the commission's capacity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Subsection (2) says the Industrial Relations Commission should have the capacity to set minimum standards about what constitutes regular part-time employment, but subsection (4) says, `We think they might come to some conclusions we don't like, so the parliament should give a direction to the Industrial Relations Commission to limit its capacity to deal with it.' If you listen to the argument not from the minister but from those who purport to support him&mdash;I think it is support he could do without on some occasions&mdash;you would think that there is nothing in the bill that says the Industrial Relations Commission can set criteria. It is stated quite explicitly here. The problem is not that it is not here, which seems to be the import of your argument, but rather that subsection (4) limits it for reasons that have not been effectively established.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I appreciate that sometimes that is what you would want to argue&mdash;and the conclusion the Industrial Relations Commission might come to&mdash;and the government might, on many occasions, when debating the question of minimum standards, want to appear before the commission and say, `You should not deal with these matters.' But that is not the same as this parliament saying, `You can consider it on the merits but if you come to a conclusion about matters covered by 4(a) or 4(b), you may not settle an industrial dispute, you may not come to a conclusion that this parliament, this government, doesn't agree with.' That is our concern&mdash;not the concern that has been manufactured by the backbench of the government that in some way we are trying to introduce the capacity of the Industrial Relations Commission to regulate that. That is already there.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> (Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very nice to have an audience here for the adjournment debate tonight. Mr Deputy Speaker, for one short moment they were all entranced. I would like to raise the question of the ongoing problems in the Republic of Cyprus, which are of great interest to the Cypriot and Greek communities in Australia, and indeed the broader Australian community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Cypriot community in Australia have taken part this week in the proceedings of Refugee Week here in Canberra. Refugee Week was brought to the attention of the House earlier on in the week by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock), and, unfortunately, other than that passing remark of the minister, the government did not seem to say much more on the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that we should pause towards the end of Refugee Week and consider the plight of people in Australia who are refugees from strife and turmoil in their own land. In particular, I think we should pay some attention to the plight of refugees in Australia from the Republic of Cyprus, particularly those people from the northern part of that country that has been occupied by the Turkish army for the last 22 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our hearts should go out to the people from the Kyrenia district of Cyprus, in particular. A large number of families in this country who came from that part of Cyprus were expelled by the Turks in the 1970s when the Turkish invaders invaded northern Cyprus. They have seen their property handed over to Turkish settlers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of these Australian citizens have been particularly disadvantaged just because their names are Greek. When the Turkish army invaded northern Cyprus, the Turks originally went round and said to people who were foreign nationals that they should hang the flag of their country outside their homes and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> they would not face expropriation of their property.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were many British nationals, Americans and people from other parts of Europe who had property in Cyprus. They still own those properties in northern Cyprus. The people who lost their properties were people with Greek names. Many of those people lived in Australia; they were not living in Cyprus at the time of the invasion. For example, there is an Irish woman who is the widow of a Greek Cypriot. She is an Australian citizen and holds proper title to a property in northern Cyprus. But because her married name is Greek, the Turkish occupying power will not recognise her title to this property.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that the Australian government should give assistance to these Australian citizens who own property in northern Cyprus to run a case in the International Court of Justice to re&hyphen;acquire their property. Earlier tonight we heard a lot from the government about the rights of individuals in property and to property. Surely the Australian government should do something to help these Australian citizens re&hyphen;acquire the property that was stolen from them by force of arms. They were discriminated against just because of their names. If you were a Greek Cypriot whose mother might have been a Greek Cypriot and whose father was British and had an Anglo-Saxon name, your property was not confiscated. The only property that was lost was property that was owned by people with Greek names. I think that is a scandal. I commend that legal action to the House. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish, of necessity, to make some edited comments about the issue of euthanasia, given that the Northern Territory (Rights of the Terminally Ill) Bill is about to take effect. I was addressing a conference two years ago and an elderly man interjected from the back of the audience. He said, `This is all very well, but what are you doing about the issue of euthanasia? The old people of Australia don't know how they are going to survive without it.' This reflects the degree of understanding that some people have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2905">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the passage of the Northern Territory (Rights of the Terminally Ill) Bill, Australia is about to change irrevocably. Those who think that the legislation and its effect and impact will be confined to the borders of the Northern Territory, I think, are sadly misguided. We have moved, over the last 10 years in particular, into what I call an era of legislative morality, where we think as a nation that all of the problems we have, whether of racial vilification or the care of dying people, can be solved by going to statutes and passing laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many who think that this kind of legislation ought to be supported, because around 80 per cent of people responding to polls support it. The reality of that is that just because something is popular does not make it right. When people are going down the supermarket aisle on a Saturday morning looking for cornflakes and somebody says, `I'm from Newspoll. Do you think the law ought to be changed to allow doctors to end the suffering of people who are dying?', I am surprised that not 100 per cent of the people surveyed say yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much of the apparent support in the community for euthanasia legislation is driven by ignorance and fear. It is driven by a fear of dying an unnecessarily painful and undignified death. Whilst we are all obviously going to die, for most people death is a largely hypothetical experience. They have not seen a dead body. They have not sat through a death day after day, night after night and seen what it is all about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No matter what we provide&mdash;with all the wonders of modern medicine and all the support of palliative care&mdash;in about two per cent of cases not all human pain and suffering can be relieved and, of course, not all of it is physical. But those who argue that changing the law, that sanctioning the intentional ending of human life, is going to relieve all pain and suffering are sadly misguided. The law is a very blunt instrument, and I believe it does not have the finesse to deal with all of those areas of human endeavour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have cared for many people who have died&mdash;I hope that is not a reflection on my medical skills&mdash;and I also had my own <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> brother die last year after a long illness. I chaired the AMA's Ethics and Professional Conduct Committee for three years, and I have dealt with a lot of complaints about doctors. I assure you that I would like to think I come at this issue from a position of commonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The concepts of trust and respect are more likely to flourish in a relationship which is governed by ethics, morality and commonsense. Every death, like every birth, is different to the one that came before it and the one that comes after it. Those who think that generalisations or even a set of principles or a code of ethics are going to cover all the situations in which we inevitably find ourselves, either as patients or as doctors, I think, are misguided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The laws which cover the everyday transactions of life are quite difficult to introduce into a relationship between a doctor and a dying person and his or her family. It introduces a circumstance in which the doctor and the patient see each other as a potential adversary. Inevitably, under those circumstances, the interests of the patient suffer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People when they are dying, understandably, are depressed. Not infrequently, people may have a wrong diagnosis. We have all met someone who was told three years ago that they had three months to live. In many cases, people are not being given access to modern methods for relieving pain and their suffering. My experience has been that those who cite cases, which apparently are arguments in favour of such legislation, fail to recognise that when doctors fail it is more often as human beings than as scientists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Equally, I think the federal parliament simply cannot ignore the fact that one part of this country is about to change our values and that, on average, there is one youth suicide a day. Therefore, we cannot afford to legitimise death as a solution to what we think are insurmountable problems.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I had a role in starting the argument, I want to make some observations on the debate that has been entered into by the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2906"> honourable member for Boothby (Mr Southcott) and the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) with respect to the United Australia Party and its attitude to fascist regimes in Europe in the 1930s. There is ample evidence to demonstrate that, as in the United Kingdom, there was considerable sympathy within the United Australia Party, including from Sir Robert Menzies, for Hitler and Mussolini. It is important to distinguish their attitudes to those regimes and how those regimes conducted their affairs within their own countries from attitudes to appeasement and re&hyphen;armament, which are a distinct issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite true to say that the ALP in the mid-1930s was quite isolationist, but it did change later in the period. Of course, it was the Lyons government which recognised the Italian conquest. As with the United Kingdom conservatives, there were different views across all political parties about the issues of appeasement and how fascist aggression should be dealt with. The issue is not how Menzies and his cohorts responded to fascist threats to other countries; the issue is what their views were about what those fascist regimes were doing within their own countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Boothby referred to a book by E.M. Andrews called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Isolationism and appeasement in Australia. </EMPHASIS>Of course, as the honourable member for Werriwa indicated, there are substantial references in that book which demonstrate quite conclusively that Menzies and his supporters were quite pro&hyphen;fascist in various ways; quite sympathetic. After Menzies' study tour in 1938, he talked of the `spiritual quality' of the Hitler Youth. He talked of Germany being `better governed under its dictatorship'. His Foreign Minister in his first government, Henry Gullett, talked of Mussolini's `genius, his patriotism and almost superhuman capacity' and Hitler's `shining record of service to his people'. Andrews concluded, after noting Menzies' reservations, I hasten to add, about the Nazi regime&mdash;and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He also felt&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is Menzies&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that he had to see the good points in the Nazi regime: its very order and discipline were bound to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> appeal to the legal mind; its reputed opposition to all on the left appealed to his own sentiments. He thus fell into the trap of defending it.</PARA>
<PARA>So much for the protestations of the honourable member for Boothby. His own source says that Menzies was pro&hyphen;fascist, that Menzies was sympathetic to fascist regimes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is other evidence available. In 1938 Menzies told a gathering of Scotch College students that, although Hitler and Mussolini had in some respects gone too far, he had some admiration for what they were doing. In practical actions, this can also be seen. In l940, only a matter of days before Italy entered the war on the side of Germany, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Giornale Italiano</EMPHASIS>, effectively an official publication from Italy, was being openly published and allowed to be published in Australia by the United Australia Party government, full of pro&hyphen;German propaganda. At the same time&mdash;and before then, of course&mdash;journals of the left had been suppressed and people in the left had been hounded, yet this journal of fascist propaganda, from a country which was about to go to war against the allies and was strongly supportive, prior to going to war against the allies, of the German cause, was allowed to continue publication by the then federal United Australia Party government until virtually the day that Italy entered the war.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Boothby has used gross hyperbole and caricaturing of the member for Werriwa's argument to try to discredit it. He suggests that the member for Werriwa is arguing that Menzies was&mdash;and I quote from the speech by the member for Boothby the other night&mdash;`a closet Nazi' and `Australia's Kurt Waldheim'; `a dark, secret Nazi past' on the part of Menzies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of this is nonsense. The honourable member for Werriwa and I are not suggesting anything of the sort. We are arguing that the United Australia Party, the predecessors to today's Liberals, and Menzies, were relatively sympathetic to fascism at the time. They might have had some different views about the expansionist and aggressive intentions of the Nazi and Italian fascist regimes. But they were quite supportive in many respects of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2907"> what those regimes were doing in their own societies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To suggest, as the honourable member for Boothby did, that Menzies was a great democrat is laughable. Menzies was the man who tried to have a referendum passed so that he would be able to accuse people of being communists, throw them in gaol and then the onus would be on them to prove that they were not communists. The first public list that was issued contained several mistakes&mdash;people who were not members of the Communist Party. Yes, there were some people in the 1930s in the ALP who were sympathetic to fascism, Franco and Mussolini, but not to Hitler. But where did they end up? They ended up in the DLP. What did the DLP do? They kept the Liberal Party in power for 23 years federally. So the people in the Labor Party who were sympathetic to those fascist regimes ended up in their right political place eventually, that is, supporting the Liberal Party.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Filling in forms is one of the most tedious, time consuming and often apparently pointless exercises in our lives. This fact has been acknowledged by the creation of the Small Business Task Force, which is committed to eliminating 50 per cent of paperwork carried out by the business community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suggest that we look at another area of serious form filling which affects almost everyone in our society&mdash;opening a bank account. I realise the Taxation Office will cringe in horror at the thought of going back to the days when one only had to walk into a bank with a dollar in hand and open an account to deposit that said dollar. This simple matter is burdened by the need to produce enough personal identification to meet a score of 100 points. What this means, for those with felonious intent, is a few hours at a computer loaded with a desktop publishing program. But what it means for the great majority of our citizens is the tiresome business of collecting documentation&mdash;enough to prove who you are several times over.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those fortunate enough to have a current passport, opening a bank account is made easier, as a passport qualifies for 70 points. Coupled with a drivers licence, worth 40 points, the tally is met and one can now deposit one's cash. But not everyone has a passport. Neither does everyone have a drivers licence. For these people the paper chase is quite extraordinary. The best they can get for the compulsory Medicare card is a mere 25 points in this, the quest for the vital 100 points.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A birth certificate, the original, is the next best option. But even with this, it is not a quick task, as those who have gone down this trail to get their passport renewed can testify. A letter and a cheque have to be sent to the relevant office of births, deaths and marriages, and then there is a wait for the original or a copy of the original birth certificate to arrive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A young person just out of school, with little or no documentation, has a hard time finding these adult ID documents. If still at school, life is a little easier for a young person keen enough to open a savings account. An official letter from the school scores at least 40 points on this banking ID scale. Add to this the Medicare card&mdash;a mere 25 points&mdash;and they are halfway legal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our economists tell us this country urgently needs to improve its savings levels. I am not surprised they are so slow when establishing a bank account is such a tedious business. If fulfilling the point criteria meant a person opening a bank account automatically had access to all facilities, it could make a little more sense, but, of course, it does not. To get into the serious matter of borrowing the bank, naturally, does serious checking on the identification and collateral of its customer. So why the caution in the mere fact of opening the account?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current system of demanding reams of documented proof of existence does not deter those who wish to open a second account in a different name to confuse authorities. I am not suggesting that we do not have a form of identification to appease the taxation department. What I am saying is that the current <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2908"> system is an overkill. I am sure banking staff as well as the millions of customers subjected to this procedure would be overjoyed if the system were less rigid. As well it would encourage more to start saving.

I want to turn to an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  of 17 February 1996 in which Janet Fife&hyphen;Yeomans states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Three out of four Australian women who have had silicon breast implants have had them removed. . . </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over 50,000 Australian have had breast implants and more than 4000 have ongoing legal claims against manufacturers.</PARA>
<PARA>Tonight I want to enlarge upon my comments of 18 June to compare this situation with what is happening in America. In the United States, a global settlement fund for breast implant recipients was established&mdash;I understand in 1994&mdash;for US women injured as a result of breast implants, with 97 per cent of the proceeds of that fund going to US women and three per cent to foreign women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The discriminatory treatment was the subject of appeal, but that became irrelevant because the settlement fund collapsed due to a lack of funding. Following the collapse of the global settlement fund, the major non-Dow implant manufacturers announced a revised settlement for domestic claimants only. Only women with American citizenship or residency or women who had their implants inserted in the USA are eligible to participate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Dow Corning Corporation, the largest manufacturer of breast implants, has filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in the Michigan Bankruptcy Court. A chapter 11 bankruptcy is non-liquidation&mdash;Dow Corning is not insolvent. It <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is probably similar to an Australian scheme of arrangement. The process allows the company to close off previous debts and liabilities for previous lawsuits and to emerge effectively as a new company. In a way, it is an escape from creditors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As part of the chapter 11 process, all litigation against the company in the US has been stayed. When a company files for a chapter 11 bankruptcy under US law, it is required to present a company reorganisation plan to pay off previous debts. This includes product liability claims made against the company for personal injuries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some kind of settlement scheme must be proposed. This must be approved as fair by the judge in charge of the bankruptcy or the company reorganisation will not be approved. Judge Spector, the judge of the Michigan Bankruptcy Court overseeing the Dow Corning bankruptcy, has indicated that the discrimination against foreign women that occurred in the now defunct global settlement fund will not extend into bankruptcy proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, little progress appears to have been made in establishing a settlement fund for the 4,000 Australian women who have been injured by implants. The tragic aspect to all of this is that in the minds of some people there is a belief or an opinion that these women are simply chasing after money. They do not seem to recognise the intense agony and the loss of life that is occurring amongst so many of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The manufacturers do have a responsibility and that responsibility should be shared equally to Australian women. They should not be discriminated against in favour of American women. The reality is that no amount of money can replace the health of these women. No amount of money can bring back to children and the rest of the family the mother, the wife, as she was prior to the onset of that illness that resulted from the implant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These women have not had the right to make a truly informed decision about their own bodies and lives because, as is claimed in those suits, there was not proper product information made available at the time of the decision to seek that implant or to have the procedure carried out.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2909">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is likely that the bankruptcy process will be lengthy and that appeals will further delay the distribution of compensation. Because litigation against Dow Corning in the United States is currently stayed, a group of test cases against the Dow group of companies is being pursued in Victoria. Also involved in the litigation are Dow Corning's subsidiary companies, including the local company, Dow Corning Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Cases have been entered into the major torts list, a program established recently to manage the cases that involved serious legal issues and injuries. The cases are being managed by Mr Justice Hedigan of the Supreme Court. He will make orders with which all parties must comply and ensure that the cases move efficiently through the court processes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are other American manufacturers involved&mdash;3M, Baxter and BMS. Because of the collapse of the global settlement fund, alternative strategies must be devised for clients with implants from these manufacturers. Currently test cases are being sought to be tried in the District Court of Texas. It is unlikely that they are going to be dealt with before early 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australian women are entitled to equity on this. I seek the support of other members in the House on what I see as a major injustice being perpetrated upon Australian women in this case.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

It is estimated that only one in 20 dementia sufferers is cared for in dementia&hyphen;specific facilities. The majority, 51 per cent, are cared for in their own homes by family members; 37 per cent are cared for in nursing homes; nine per cent are cared for in hostels; and three per cent are cared for in other facilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There can be no doubt that there is a very urgent need to provide specialist care for dementia sufferers because the reality is that Australia is witnessing a crisis in the provision of such care. One of the nation's oldest <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and most respected aged care providers, the Hammond Care Group, is based in my electorate of Hughes. The Hammond Care Group provides residential and day care to elders at the Hammond Village at Hammondville, which is an adjoining suburb of Holsworthy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Hammond Care Group has a well deserved reputation for delivering effective and high quality programs which enable older adults to maximise and improve their quality of life, and for its continuing commitment to providing for those dementia sufferers who are least able to provide for themselves. The Hammond village facility provides day care, hostel and nursing home facilities for more than 400 aged residents&mdash;about half of whom suffer from Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia. This excellent facility includes three nursing homes, two of which are general nursing homes of 78 beds and one dementia&hyphen;specific nursing home of 72 beds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Hammond Care Group's newest hostel is the Meadows, which, as a purpose designed dementia&hyphen;specific hostel, is unlike any other in Australia and is gaining worldwide acclaim as a centre of excellence in dementia care. This purpose designed hostel provides for 40 people, including one respite place. The Hammond village facility includes a general hospital for 100 people as well as two respite places and self-care and supported self-care cottages for 50 people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also a day care and respite centre called Gabrielle's for the elderly still living in the community. Gabrielle's also conducts a carers education program and is establishing a healthy aged program. The facility also includes a respite care program for five people requiring home care and a day therapy service, an allied health service and a volunteer program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Hammond Care Group is a leader in the provision of professional advice and expertise to other aged care organisations, and the organisation is successfully working with other aged care providers to meet this urgent need both in Australia and overseas such as in South-East Asia, North America and Europe. This is evidenced by the fact that the Commonwealth Department of Health and Family Services has selected the Hammond <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2910"> Care Group to provide training in dementia care to 500 nursing homes and hostels in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory as part of the government's national action plan for dementia care. I am proud that the Hammond Care Group, a world leading provider in dementia care, is within my electorate of Hughes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to bring to the attention of this honourable House that this important dementia care facility is potentially under the flight paths of the airport which may or may not be established at Holsworthy. The Hammond village facility is adjacent to the Holsworthy defence area. As far as people with dementia are concerned, close proximity to an international airport is a situation which could adversely affect their lives to a far greater degree than that of ordinary healthy citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Chief Executive of the Hammond Care Group, Dr Stephen Judd, said to me the other day, `Noise is to dementia sufferers what stairs are to people in wheelchairs.' Noise disables, disorientates, disturbs and increases agitation. Whatever other compelling reasons there may be for saying no to an airport at Holsworthy, our compassion for those who in our community are old and suffer from the disabling disease of dementia should be one of the most compelling considerations of all. That a dementia care provider of the standard of excellence maintained by the Hammond Care Group at Hammondville may be located under the flight paths of an international airport is not only a disgrace but also an obscene waste of a desperately needed resource.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to share with you the advantages that Mature Action offered to me at a time when I was starting to wonder if anyone out there really cared about our age group . . . After finishing this skillshare course I then went on to Northern Metropolitan College of TAFE and successfully completed a full&hyphen;time course in office administration. Without Mature Action I would not have had the confidence to move on, or believe that I could become a competent skilled office worker.</PARA>
<PARA>Another letter stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I had been a cleaner for 21 years and then my job was made redundant at the hospital that I worked in. I had not been in the work force for 18 months when I went to Mature Action and I felt that I could not get a job because of my age (56) . . . After completing the ten week course . . .

<PARA>These are a handful of examples from one skillshare group in the network of over 400 across Australia. Every skillshare has similar success stories to tell.

Skillshares are managed by community based committees of management&mdash;people who voluntarily give their time to participate in the running of these centres and for which they bear legal responsibility.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I take this opportunity to oppose the Crimes Amendment (Controlled Operations) Bill. I do not intend to vote against it; I just want to record my concerns. I congratulate the Attorney&hyphen;General, Daryl Williams. I think that this bill is an improvement on the one that was put forward by the Australian Labor Party. But it is simply naive if the Attorney&hyphen;General believes that he has put in safeguards that are not going to see the Commonwealth police become very large&hyphen;scale drug dealers in this country. The all&hyphen;pervading power of drugs and the money that is involved have had a very corrosive effect on public confidence. I believe that it has to be tackled as a whole issue, not in this piecemeal way of giving the police ever&hyphen;increasing powers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite clear to me that the power the police will obtain will be abused. Why do I say that? Because the power of the police is always abused. All power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> a few days ago had as a headline that Western Australian police are the most corrupt in Australia. I do not believe that. I do not think it is true at all. I think there are elements of corruption which pervade the whole police system and the whole judicial system in Australia. What we need in Australia is not a royal commission&mdash;I think the royal commissioners themselves are, sadly, tainted&mdash;but a public inquiry into all aspects of the administration of justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I look at the justice system in Western Australia, which I know well, I find it is quite clear that there has been collusion between the prosecution and the police to hide evidence, to falsify evidence, to put forward stuff that they know to be untrue. That, of course, is in total breach of the duty of the prosecution, whose responsibility is to put forward all the evidence and only the evidence. As the High Court has observed, if a prosecutor deviates from this course, he becomes a very powerful unsworn witness for the prosecution. This has happened, sadly, all too often in Western Australia and, I suspect, throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have here a paper entitled, `Peeling the onion of Long Bay', written by a friend of mine who was actually on remand in Long Bay at the time, under outrageous circumstances. I believe that half a million dollars&mdash;his dollars&mdash;later, he has been justified. But it is quite clear that there are people in Long Bay because they were set up by the police. The police have awesome powers to fabricate evidence; to set up people. The thing which is driving this, of course, is the corrupting money of drugs. If we are going to do something about this, we have to look at the thing as a whole. I believe that if we were serious about it&mdash;and I do not believe for one moment that we are&mdash;what we would be doing is legalising and controlling the distribution of these drugs to take the money out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only way to deal with the big operators, at the big end of town&mdash;which this bill is supposed to attack and simply will not&mdash;is to take away the profit margin. If you raise the risk, you raise the margins, and the big operators enhance their profits.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that it is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2913"> quite possible to supply drugs on prescription to known addicts at a price which would pay for their cost. After all, most of these drugs are very cheap to produce. It would take away the profit motive. In my view, in that way that industry could be killed stone dead. If there are a few people whose addiction is enhanced by this greater availability, that is a price I would be very happy to pay to do away with the all&hyphen;corroding effect of drugs on the legal system in Australia. I think it is something that is going to have to be faced up to. I do not see either the government or the opposition facing up to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does not just stop at drugs. It pervades the whole legal system. I believe there is evidence of this in the Family Court which, in my view, is an abomination that seeks to be legal. I have a case in Western Australia of a woman who is being unmercifully hounded and harassed by the Family Court. She has lost a fortune, which was a fortune that she brought to the marriage. There is also the matter of the behaviour of the judge in this case. I go through the transcripts, and I get briefings from the civil liberties people, and the behaviour of the judge is beyond belief. The woman has been bashed up in the car park on a couple of occasions, obviously by people who have a vested interest in making sure she does not succeed in her case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One wonders where these things are going to end. I will not be voting against this bill; my vote will be pointless. I want it on the record that I think this bill is dangerous and it sets a dangerous precedent. It will give powers to the Federal Police that will be abused. If anyone thinks that the Federal Police are any different from the state police, I think they are very sadly mistaken. I want it on the record that this bill will not achieve what it sets out to do. There is a possibility that it will in fact do very little, or nothing. There is a risk, in my view, that it will lead to even greater corruption of the police forces, and the judiciary, I might add, than already exists today.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) commented on matters that all of us in this place need to take very seriously. Whilst I do not concur with the conclusions he reaches at this stage, nonetheless, the matters he raises are sufficiently serious, I think, for the parliament to continue to keep this particular item of legislation, and other similar items of legislation, under review to ensure that the abuses that he envisages arising from it are nipped in the bud at the earliest possible opportunity. Later, in what will be a fairly short speech on this matter, I will talk more about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it might be useful to go back over some of the background to how this particular bill arises. It arises out of a case in the High Court known as the Ridgeway case. As I understand it, the circumstances of that particular case are that a man named Ridgeway formed an association in prison, in South Australia in the 1980s, with another prisoner called Lee. When Lee was released, he became an informer for the police in Malaysia. Subsequent to that, Ridgeway established contact with Lee, with the intention of importing heroin into Australia. In that context, with Lee as an informer for the Malaysian police, the Malaysian police and Australian Federal Police cooperated in what was called a controlled operation where the police were involved in the importation of heroin in order to obtain convictions, presumably not just of Ridgeway but further up the food chain in relation to drug distribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the problem for the police was the relevant section of the Customs Act that provides that any person who imports or attempts to import into Australia any prohibited import to which the section applies shall be guilty of an offence. Ridgeway was convicted but the High Court, on appeal, ultimately upheld his appeal on the basis that evidence associated with the controlled operation should have been excluded under the discretion of the court to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2914"> exclude evidence on public policy grounds&mdash;that is, the court could exclude evidence obtained by unlawful means. The justices of the High Court stated that if law enforcement officials were to be exempted from the law that would be a matter for the parliament and not for the courts. The High Court also made the finding that police have no special immunity from the criminal law and that if criminal offences are committed during an investigation that could taint evidence to the extent that a judge could exclude that evidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill arises from the quite reasonable desire of the former government and this current government to clarify the position and the protections available to law enforcement officers in the sorts of circumstances they found themselves in in the Ridgeway matter. The nature of drug offences and the corrosive influences of that particular sort of activity which the member for Kalgoorlie referred to are well known and the involvement of organised crime in those sorts of activities does require perhaps more novel, innovative ways, including controlled operations, of addressing that sort of crime. So the essential issue before the parliament, as the member for Kalgoorlie indicated, is the nature of the protections that are available if police are to be conferred with some sort of immunity from the criminal law in relation to what would perhaps be, in other circumstances, slightly unconventional actions they may take with respect to investigations in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are three substantial protections in the legislation. One is a protection substantially from police entrapping individuals. Clause 15I(2) of the bill, for example, provides that the exemption of law enforcement officers from certain offences does not apply if the conduct of the officer involves intentionally inducing the person targeted to commit an offence and the person would not otherwise have had the intent to commit the offence. Therefore, there is protection against the quite legitimate concern about entrapment that could arise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further fundamental provision is that the bill makes it quite clear that the discretion of courts to exclude evidence in criminal proceedings or to stay criminal proceedings in the interests of justice is not limited by the operation of this bill. I suppose the other very significant protection that exists for civil liberties and for ensuring that there are some barriers to the sort of police conduct that the member for Kalgoorlie was concerned about is in section 15S of the bill, where the authorising officer, whether that be an AFP officer or a customs officer, needs to report to the minister in question about the action taken; that is, there is a provision that, within three months after a certificate authorising a controlled operation ceases to be in force, the officer must give to the minister a written report stating whether or not the controlled operation authorised by the certificate was carried out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the operation was carried out, the report must provide considerable detail about the operation, which I do not propose, in the interests of brevity, to go into. Finally, there is a provision in the bill for the minister to table the report before parliament with respect to the controlled operations and some of the circumstances surrounding it. It seems to me on balance that those protections are not only desirable but, I hope, adequate. But they need, as I started off by saying, to be continually reviewed by this parliament to ensure that undesirable consequences do not arise in conferring these sorts of powers on police officers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the issues that did arise in debate last year was that the present Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) argued, as I understand it, in the House of Representatives that there should be a judicial officer, a judge, involved in the issuing of a certificate to authorise police to carry out controlled operations with immunity from liability. It is interesting that last year the Attorney&hyphen;General did argue for that particular additional protection. I notice that in the Senate <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2915"> at the end of last month, when this bill was dealt with, Senator Vanstone, on behalf of the government, indicated her understanding that judges being involved in the criminal investigation process could well invalidate court proceedings at a later date in relation to the matters that the judges had been involved in. That is clearly a very serious matter that the parliament needs to ensure it does not transgress on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the question of judicial involvement in the issue of certificates, I notice also that Mr Rozenes, of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, in giving evidence to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee on this matter last year, had the following things to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no comparison, in my view, between the role that is required to be performed by the grantor of the certificate in this investigative exercise with that which is reposed in the federal court judge, or the magistrate, or whatever it is who gives a warrant for either listening devices, or search warrants, or anything else, where there is a clear requirement that there be balanced the interests of the citizen who is about to have his property turned upside down, his premises invaded, his body samples taken, or his voice listened to, monitored, reported and recorded, on the one hand, and law enforcement requirements on the other. There, there is  genuine balancing of competing public interest which requires additional involvement. But even that is currently the subject matter of challenge in the High Court and may, or may not, survive that case. In these situations, there is no competing private right or interest that needs to be balanced against the law enforcement requirement.</PARA>
<PARA>These are matters of very great constitutional substance which I do not propose to go into in this particular debate, except to say that, because they are of such substance and because the powers that are being conferred on law enforcement officers in these matters are so substantial, I believe there is an obligation on this parliament at some time&mdash;and I am not sure whether it is appropriate at this stage to specify the time, but at some reasonable time in the future&mdash;to have a look at the way in which these particular provisions have operated to ensure that they are operating satisfactorily, the appropriate balances are in place and there is not abuse by our law enforcement organisations of the trust that has been placed in them. In that context, the question of judicial review ought to be revisited, in my opinion, and that ought to form a basis for a further report to parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On balance, this is a bill that, for the reasons I mentioned before&mdash;the nature of drug offences, the nature of organised crime involvement in drug offences&mdash;does require measures that perhaps some of us would be uncomfortable with in other circumstances. However, it is not a matter that the parliament ought to confer and then forget about. These are powers that the parliament ought to review in the not too distant future to ensure that all the appropriate protections are in place.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I apologise for my delayed appearance before the Main Committee. I was chairing the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs. One of the problems of the parliament at the moment is that one seems to be required to be in so many places at the same time. I thank the former minister opposite for his courtesy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is always refreshing in the parliament when we find pieces of legislation which are supported by all parties. It is not widely recognised in the Australian community just how often the political parties and both sides of parliament agree when changes to the law are necessary. Quite often in the area of the attorney&hyphen;general and justice portfolio this is the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) was the minister who was originally responsible for the legislative response to the Ridgeway case. The Ridgeway case was one <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2916"> of those High Court decisions where the court threw back to the parliament a problem which had to be solved through legislative amendment. It ought to be recognised that this bill is a considered response, having been introduced by the previous government and referred to a Senate committee. Suggested amendments were made by that committee and accepted by the new government. We now find ourselves debating the Crimes Amendment (Controlled Operations) Bill 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The facts in Ridgeway are actually quite interesting. The case R. v. Ridgeway concerned an operation in which officers of the Australian Federal Police were involved in the importation of a trafficable quantity of heroin. In the High Court, Justice McHugh recited the facts of Ridgeway as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">[Ridgeway] was released from prison in February 1989. In September and October 1989, he travelled to Singapore under a false name and in breach of his parole conditions. In Singapore, he met Lee and solicited him to import heroin into Australia. Unbeknown to . . . [Ridgeway], Lee had become an informer for the Royal Malaysian Police Force. The officer who `ran' Lee was Thian Soo Chong, an Assistant Superintendent of Police. Lee kept Superintendent Chong informed of his dealings with Ridgeway. In turn, Superintendent Chong alerted Superintendent Butler, an Australian Federal Police Officer stationed in Kuala Lumpur, as to the plans of . . . [Ridgeway]. With the knowledge, if not the encouragement of the Australian Federal Police, Superintendent Chong and Lee purchased heroin in north Malaysia for about $4000 on 18 December 1989 for the purposes of delivering it to . . . [Ridgeway] in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Arrangements were made by members of the Australian Federal Police and the Royal Malaysian Police Force for Superintendent Chong and Lee to travel to Australia carrying the heroin in a plastic bag inside a tissue box which was in a camera bag. Australian Federal Police officers took steps to ensure that Superintendent Chong&mdash;who was carrying the heroin&mdash;was not searched or detained by Australian Customs officers.</PARA>
<PARA>History records that Ridgeway was later arrested by the Australian Federal Police, after having purchased the heroin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the years, Mr Deputy Speaker, law enforcement officers in this country have used covert operations to monitor illegal narcotics dealings, to track them through customs and then to apprehend those involved in importation, possession and other offences. The circumstances in this case are, however, quite different. Law enforcement officers themselves were involved in importing heroin for the purposes of apprehending Ridgeway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bills Digest </EMPHASIS>has a very effective dissection of the provisions of the bill. When one looks at what is proposed, one has to accept that the legislation we are debating contains an appropriate balance. The High Court decision, therefore, was to the effect that, where law enforcement officials themselves committed an element of the offence for which a defendant is subsequently prosecuted, then as a general rule a court should exercise its discretion to refuse to allow evidence of that element of the offence to be admitted against the defendant. A certain number of the judges&mdash;Sir Anthony Mason, Mr Justice Deane and Mr Justice Dawson&mdash;indicated that, if law enforcement officers are to engage in unlawful conduct in the course of investigations, then a legislative scheme authorising this conduct would need to be established. The genesis of the original bill was, no doubt, the suggestions by those three learned High Court judges that this parliament needed to plug what was obviously an unintended consequence of the law as it existed at the time the Ridgeway facts occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The main elements of the bill allow the commissioner, the deputy commissioners and the assistant commissioners of the Australian Federal Police and members of the National Crime Authority to issue certificates authorising a controlled law enforcement operation involving the import, export and/or possession of narcotic drugs.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also provides that certain law <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2917"> enforcement officers, acting in good faith and in the course of duty in relation to an authorised controlled operation, are not criminally liable for certain offences against section 233B of the Customs Act 1901 or offences against sections 10 to 14 of the Crimes (Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Act 1990&mdash;that relate to the possession, importation or exportation of narcotics&mdash;and associated offences, such as conspiracy, aiding and abetting, and in some cases state and territory offences relating to the possession of narcotic substances and associated offences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also provides that the fact that law enforcement officials took part in, or facilitated, the importation of narcotics prior to the commencement of the bill is not to render evidence of that importation inadmissible, where the importation was made pursuant to a request from the Australian Federal Police to the Australian Customs Service for an exemption from detailed customs scrutiny. The bill also includes procedures which will contain the usage of controlled operations to instances involving the investigation or detection of, or the prosecution of persons for, serious criminal activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill seeks to, in fact, bring in a balanced regime to enable the law enforcement officers of the Commonwealth to carry out their duties. Clearly, one of the great tragedies in Australia is the level of importation of drugs and the devastating effect that drugs have on our youth and on others who have become addicted to them. Consequently, the parliament must always consider community benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At times, I am concerned when there are elements of retrospectivity in relation to legislation. Civil liberties should be preserved. It ought to be noted, though, that this particular bill provides a number of very important protections. So the balance has been maintained. Some in the community may criticise the government for not having got the balance exactly right, but I believe that the government is entitled to be praised not only for continuing with this particular piece of legislation but also for incorporating the amendments suggested by the Senate. It ought to be recognised that a person cannot be convicted if, in fact, the person only committed the offence because of the actions of the federal law enforcement officers. So, to be found guilty a person must have been a person who was going to commit an offence anyway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the government and I commend the opposition for continuing to support the government on this issue. As I have said, this is a bill which is supported by both sides of the parliament. It is a bill which, I believe, is in the interests of the Australian community. It is a bill that sends a message to drug traffickers that this country is not going to be soft on drugs or crime. The parliament is seeking to protect Australians from the evil of drugs while ensuring that safeguards are maintained in our law so that people are treated fairly, properly and equitably. I commend the bill to the Main Committee.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This concludes one of the most passionate debates that has existed not so much within the parliament as within the community of those concerned about the way in which we deal with our response to the balance between the right of law enforcement and the protection of civil liberties within our community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) has rightly indicated, I was minister at the time the High Court brought down its decision in the Ridgeway case. The member for Fisher has set out the background to that litigation, so there is no need to canvass it again. In short, the parliament was then faced with a choice as to whether or not it would facilitate what had been a traditional policing practice of being involved in controlled operations in the area of drug <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2918"> importations or to, in a sense, do nothing and thereby end what was our advice at the time as to what was the most effective way of dealing not against the small players in the international drug trade but rather against the Mr Bigs, the people who were the principal sponsors of the drug trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Briefly, that dilemma arises because a capacity to involve law enforcement in controlled operations is absent. Whenever the police found a courier with a small amount of some drug&mdash;or with a large amount of drug&mdash;they would be limited in what they could do. In a controlled operation, they seek to enlist the aid of that courier&mdash;to `turn' that courier&mdash;to follow those drugs and create an operation designed to sting the principal organiser of the scheme, and to follow the drug trail as far up the line as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All the advice I received as minister at the time was that, without the capacity to undertake controlled operations, we would in a sense be limited to arresting the small players in the game. Often they were individuals who were driven to extremity, perhaps by their own addiction or by their own greed, but they were essentially small players in the game against those who are really the professionals, the Mr Bigs of the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believed it was important for us to deal with the High Court decision in a way which enabled that law enforcement obligation to be continued. I said at the time, in introducing the Crimes Amendment (Controlled Operations) Bill, that good law enforcement is a citizen's entitlement. I made the point that loss of confidence in law enforcement would lead governments to measures destructive of civil liberties. I indicated that I did not believe that this bill was such a measure and I said that the choice, in my view, was between a society prepared to accept balanced legislation to counter criminals and a society poisoned by the conditions created by those criminals and their activities. I made the point that the bill set out a full and open system of accountability which required reports to the responsible minister and, in turn, reports to the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is fair to say that those views were certainly not universally accepted by a significant component of those practising at the criminal bar. From their ranks was organised a coalition&mdash;I think it was called the Ridgeway coalition&mdash;which sought to influence members of this House to oppose the measures which I introduced. There has been within the House, on both sides of the parliament&mdash;the coalition parties and our own side&mdash;a very heightened awareness of the need to ensure that, in considering this bill, all the civil liberties issues that were raised by the Ridgeway coalition were properly taken into account and included, in so far as they could be, in the considerations that have occurred to date in the construction of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It pleases me that, after the process of parliamentary scrutiny, a Senate inquiry and a change of government, the bill finds its way back into the House in substantially the same form as I introduced it. It pleases me because it vindicates what I took to be the proper balance at the time; a balance which was then in some contention but which has survived one of the most rigorous processes of examination of any legislation in the parliamentary system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In these remarks, I place on record my particular thanks to Senator Barney Cooney for his work as chair, not only of the Senate committee which examined this legislation but also of the caucus committee on legal and constitutional affairs for many years. He is a person with whom I have had some fierce arguments. He is a person given to strong views, particularly on the subject of civil liberties. In the role that I had to fulfil as Minister for Justice, it was inevitable that, from time to time, we would have a contest of ideas which would require us <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2919"> to test each other's assumptions and test the propositions that we were each making in terms of our advocacies to each other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to record my very sincere and deep gratitude to Senator Cooney for the work he put into his consideration of government legislation coming before him, both in the caucus committee and in his role as chair of the Senate committee. I believe that the work of this parliament is immeasurably enhanced by parliamentarians of the calibre of Senator Cooney, who have not risen to ministerial rank&mdash;and now, with the change of government, are not likely to do so&mdash;but whose contribution to this parliament and to Australia generally needs to be recognised on occasions like this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Might I also, because he is sitting next to me at the moment, mention my colleague the member for Banks (Mr Melham), with whom I have also had some fierce contests. It would be no surprise to members of this House to know that the member for Banks took a view contrary to that which I proposed at the time and contested that view fiercely. I believe, also, that this is the place where those arguments can be tested and where the willingness of members to run against the grain of what their own government is doing from time to time is to be valued.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have also been occasions where the member for Banks and I have very much been on the same side. In pulling out materials today for this debate, I inadvertently pulled out a copy of the Crimes (Investigation of Commonwealth Offences) Amendment Bill 1990, which has a similar title to the one we are debating today. I thought I was getting a transcript of what I had said on this legislation earlier, but I pulled this from the computer. That was legislation about which the member for Banks and I had a dialogue with the then Attorney&hyphen;General, Mr Duffy, which resulted in very substantial improvements to the way in which records of interview were conducted&mdash;the videotaping of them and the limiting of time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These were measures which many then involved in law enforcement said would result in a limitation on the ability of law enforcement to do its task, but which, as events have transpired, have not had that effect at all. In fact, they are now universally seen as measures which have improved the accountability of the way the police operate and the effectiveness of policing. Certainly, they have meant that there is far less challenge to the admissibility of confessional evidence, and very much less contest about the way in which police are alleged to have extorted that evidence from people, in improper circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the member for Banks and I do find common ground on some issues. If I want to flatter myself, I would say that I took a firmer civil liberties position with respect to that, although we were both on the same side. We succeeded in persuading the then Attorney&hyphen;General to our point of view, to the benefit, I think, of the Australian community generally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I record my thanks to Barney Cooney and admit my respect for the fierce opposition that was provided to me and to the member for Banks, who managed to hedge me in and cause me enormous frustration and delay, and from time to time some little annoyance at the way in which he was able to contest this field of ideas at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do think it is a little bit of a pity that we were not able to pass this legislation before the expiry of the last term of parliament. We did give it a T category status, which meant the highest priority for legislation, but the then opposition in the Senate declined to avail us of the opportunity of passage of that legislation. The consequence of that is that, although we are now rectifying a situation which needed to be rectified, a number of then pending <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2920"> prosecutions have failed; a number of major drug importation prosecutions failed in that interim period when this legislation was not in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to put on record my regret that the then shadow minister, Senator Vanstone, did not grasp the seriousness of this issue and that the coalition was not in a position to support legislation which it now brings again before the House. That delay has led to some unfortunate miscarriages of justice, not in a technical legal sense but in a practical sense, where the evidence against persons alleged to be guilty of crimes could not be brought before the court because of the Ridgeway decision&mdash;a matter we are now correcting with respect to future and still pending prosecutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So that delay has had some serious consequences from the point of view of the community at large. That said, I do join with the member for Fisher to say that I am pleased with the bipartisanship that was ultimately shown. I record that the now Attorney&hyphen;General, the member for Tangney (Mr Williams), did indicate when this bill first came before the House his support for it in general terms, a position which is now endorsed by his carriage of this legislation back into the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think I need say no more. In debates in 1995 I set out my reasons for support of this legislation in some detail and also contested some of the arguments that were then made about the appropriateness of approvals being given by judges, a view I still adhere to in principle, in the sense that I do not believe that with a separation of powers this is an appropriate task to designate to judges, and also in technical legal black&hyphen;letter law a task which I believe it is incompetent to devolve upon judges, given the decisions of the High Court in recent litigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is one of these rare occasions where one can say that after fierce contest one feels vindicated. I am delighted that I am able to stand here and say that I initiated this legislation. It has undergone an ordeal of fire. It has passed that ordeal and I believe that it has passed it to the benefit of the Australian community.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak briefly to the Crimes Amendment (Controlled Operations) Bill 1996 and also to indicate that a number of members have some concerns about the procedures that are being used by the government in relation to the introduction of bills or their second reading speeches in the Main Committee rather than in the House of Representatives chamber. It is a matter we will be endeavouring to change, to reform, because we consider that not to be in the best interests of a democratic and properly functioning House of Representatives. As a former member of the Procedure Committee, I have some serious concerns about it, having spent some time considering it when the Main Committee was being debated as a proposal of the Procedure Committee&mdash;in other words, during its formative debates. The role of the Main Committee was something that was in a sense quite distinctly different from what has evolved in more recent times as a result of the use of the Main Committee for second reading speeches in the first instance with subsequent debate more or less occurring simultaneously.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would agree with other speakers that the bill is a useful bill and it is an important adjunct to the role and the functions of modern police and narcotics detection. It is something that is absolutely critical at a time when the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> magazine, in its edition of 8 June this year, made some quite interesting comments in relation to offences in Australia that are, in my view, directly related to the growth of drug trafficking within our community. It made the comments in relation to what are perceived to be the criminal trends in the United States of America, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2921"> which is often portrayed by the media as being the crime capital of the Western world. It made some interesting comments on a survey that was conducted by the ministry of justice in the Netherlands in 1992. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">America is no more criminal than other countries. According to an international crime survey carried out by the Ministry of Justice in the Netherlands in 1992, America is not obviously more criminal than anywhere else. You are more likely to be burgled in Australia or New Zealand; you are more likely to be robbed with violence in Spain; you are more likely to be robbed without violence in Spain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps this next part is not strictly related to drug trafficking, but it adds:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You are more likely to be raped or indecently assaulted in Canada, Australia or Western Germany.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>I make these comments because Australia's crime statistics are becoming a matter of serious concern. It is quite clear that the community is now demanding greater concentration on the part not only of their state governments, who have the immediate jurisdiction for criminal investigations, but also&mdash;in relation to drug trafficking and all of its `subsidiary industries'&mdash;on the part of the Australian federal government. This is because, in the first instance, the Australian federal government has responsibilities in relation to the importation and subsequent trafficking of narcotics across state jurisdictions and the like.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a member of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Crime Authority for six years&mdash;and I note that the member for Banks (Mr Melham) was a former colleague of mine on that committee&mdash;I can say that we have spent inordinate amounts of time looking at the way in which the National Crime Authority has been somewhat confounded in the past, due to operational requirements relating to joint operations with state police forces and the Australian Federal Police. We have also looked at, for instance, the very important report that was tabled a couple of years ago on Commonwealth law enforcement agencies and future criminal trends, and at the resourcing of Commonwealth law enforcement agencies in the future as a consequence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a continuing member of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Crime Authority, it is my view that some of the cuts foreshadowed in recent times for the forthcoming federal budget are a matter of some concern, whereas there is no doubt that, owing to the fiscal irresponsibility of the previous Labor administration, there is a substantial requirement for cost cutting on the part of the federal government&mdash;a matter that a vast majority of the community would no doubt agree with. The overwhelming victory by the coalition government bears testimony to the fact that there is a perception and a belief that the spending of the Commonwealth government was out of hand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nonetheless, across&hyphen;the&hyphen;board spending cuts are dangerous in that they are often blind to the more important necessities, particularly in areas such as this, where we have national criminal investigation agencies&mdash;the AFP and the NCA&mdash;which are facing, and are already undertaking, cuts to their administrative operations that are going to impinge on the fight against crime, drug trafficking and the insidious influence of organised crime within our community generally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are matters of concern, and I have indicated them already to the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams). This is something that I feel very strongly about. In particular, coming as I do from the state of Western Australia&mdash;as does the Attorney&hyphen;General&mdash;I am conscious that we are faced with particular problems that are, let us say, a consequence of our geography, the most notable feature of which is the large coastline of Western Australia.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2922">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is believed to be, through Western Australia's frontier&mdash;our international frontier&mdash;a regular annual importation into the country of drugs of some $1 billion in value. For instance, it was calculated in recent times that in a 100&hyphen;kilometre radius of Geraldton some $300 million worth of drugs were smuggled into Australia in the past few years. I might add that, at the same time, the Comptroller&hyphen;General of Customs at the Geraldton wharves was complaining that he had no video surveillance of activity on the wharves; a surveillance which I would have thought would have been absolutely critical to any law enforcement operation that was really going to have an effect on the importation of drugs into our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I made those comments at the beginning because a lot of offences that are occurring within our community today&mdash;particularly break and enter, stealing and robbery&mdash;are mostly drug related. Often, addicts are stealing property from ordinary citizens to feed their habits. Our state police forces are under extraordinary stress as a consequence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that in recent years the various state governments, particularly when they have been coalition governments, have had their own budgetary requirements to cut costs. We have seen reductions in real terms of budgets for the various state police forces, and in particular this impinges on the opportunities for full&hyphen;scale joint operations with Commonwealth law enforcement agencies. So there is a compounding effect of the cuts on the federal scene, the cuts on the state scene and the fact that we are witnessing an explosion of drug trafficking within our community, stimulated to some extent by our proximity to the South&hyphen;East Asian region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was privileged to be able to attend a recent conference in Sydney, organised jointly by the National Crime Authority and the Australian Federal Police, on organised crime within the South&hyphen;East Asian and Asian region. I was fascinated to hear some of the comments of law enforcement officers from our neighbouring countries. The former minister would know that I have been a critic at times because there were some restrictions placed on exchange of information between our national law enforcement agencies and some of their counterparts overseas as a consequence of policy decisions by the Australian federal government which I believed were quite extraordinary under the circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of those was that, where a jurisdiction overseas had, for instance, capital punishment on its statute books for a particular offence and where a person had been apprehended and interviewed and charged over an offence that involved a capital offence, Australia would restrict the information that would be passed on about this person's antecedents and possible connections, as a consequence of an Australian point of view on the relative severity of that penalty. In my view, that is a reverse form of chauvinism which implies that Australia's criminal code and its criminal justice system are somehow superior to those of other jurisdictions in our region. But it was in fact an impediment to the free exchange of information that would help the fight against organised crime and in particular against organised drug trafficking, in my view the greatest criminal evil facing our nation at present.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure that anyone who is a parent of children in today's community knows only too well the incipient fear at all times of the threat that their child may one day indulge in or experiment in drug consumption. In recent times we have seen some quite horrific stories where younger children&mdash;younger juveniles, let us say&mdash;are becoming involved in drug consumption at an earlier age. In fact, I recollect that when I was a police officer in Western Australia between 1979 and 1987 I came across one instance of amphetamine consumption by a Western Australian offender in my contacts. But, not that many years later, we were <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2923"> seeing instances where high school students were consuming amphetamines by injection on school premises. This is a quite extraordinary development; a trend that has to be reversed and a trend that requires not only sustained funding for our federal law enforcement agencies but also an increase which recognises the compounding, cascading effect throughout the community of this great evil that drug trafficking represents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the beginning I mentioned some of my concerns and those of some of my Independent colleagues in relation to the processes of the House of Representatives. We have seen at the beginning of the parliamentary session a statement, following on from statements made during the election campaign, regarding the changes to our processes to make the House of Representatives a better functioning, more relevant and more democratic place in which the members can represent their constituents to the best effect. I took these statements in good faith, as I am sure many others did, and I believe that these changes are absolutely critical. We must ensure at all times that, where the executive is misusing the processes of the House of Representatives, they must be resisted by all members&mdash;not just Independent members but all members&mdash;who value the hard&hyphen;fought rights of the representatives in the chamber as representatives for their constituents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can do no more for our constituents than ensure their rights are preserved. We know that, in recent years, there has been a very strong perception that not only is the debate in the House of Representatives largely irrelevant to the processes of government but also the government regards it in that vein and treats it accordingly. In relation to this bill, in relation to other bills, in relation to the processes of the House of Representatives and in relation to the processes of the Main Committee, the House must assert the rights of its members over the rights of the executive to ensure that it is more relevant and answerable to the people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can recollect sitting as a member of the coalition opposition and saying the same things. Unfortunately, as an Independent member, I am now seeing some of the traits of executive superiority being asserted over the rights of the members of the House of Representatives yet again. I hope that we can hold or push that back, because, at the end of the day, it suits everybody that that should take place. We must see the rights of members of the House of Representatives restored to their rightful place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a consequence, last sitting week, my colleague the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) moved that a number of the bills be proceeded with further in the House of Representatives chamber. I will be making a similar move shortly, in relation to the next bill. But I wanted to emphasise those points in the first instance, just to demonstrate why we are taking on this particular responsibility in the House of Representatives and in the Main Committee and why we believe that the reforms that were proposed by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), in good faith, should be undertaken all the way through to the end of their meaning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, one of those reforms related to the independent status of the Speaker of the House of Representatives, something that I am sure the member for Calare (Mr Andren), other members and I view as being extremely important. As a consequence, we are anxious to ensure that the House of Representatives supports that role and ensures that it is enhanced in all of its activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I think the bill is one, as the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) indicated, which is deserving of bipartisan support. But I want to repeat those words of caution I said at the beginning. These amendments are all very well. But, at the end of the day, when our national law enforcement agencies are suffering substantial cuts in their operational ability, a lot of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2924"> these sorts of changes&mdash;as noteworthy and as appropriate as they are&mdash;are less significant, because the agencies are less able to use the tools, the abilities and the resources, because of the infringements forced on them by the cuts to their budgets. I commend the bill to the Main Committee.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank all those who have taken part in this debate today. In summing up, there are a couple of responses I would like to make.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) referred to the possible dangers involved when police are empowered to authorise otherwise unlawful conduct by police. The accountability package in the bill will prevent abuse of the process. Frankly, if we are to have any hope of bringing major narcotics traffickers to justice, we must give police adequate powers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Narcotics trafficking is big money. It is a high risk industry. In such an environment, the possibility for attempts to corrupt police will always exist. But the way to prevent corruption is not to deny police the powers contained in this bill. It is to build in effective accountability mechanisms and safeguards against the abuses of power. The power to authorise controlled operations will lie with 12 senior experienced law enforcement officers: nine in the AFP and three in the NCA. These officers will be responsible to the parliament and the public for the conduct of these operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Openness and accountability are central to the framework established by the bill. The bill requires a detailed report to be made to the minister at the time of the decision to authorise an operation. That is, of course, contained in the proposed section 15R. The bill will also require a detailed report to be made about what happened during and after the operation; that is contained in section 15S. In addition, the Australian Federal Police are subject to a strict disciplinary regime and are subject to disciplinary and criminal penalties for misconduct under both the AFP Act and the AFP (Discipline) Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now to the comments made by the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell). He said that the proposed power will encourage corruption. Frankly, if we are to have any hope of bringing narcotics traffickers to justice, we must give police the adequate powers. The way to prevent corruption is not to deny the police these powers. Commissioner Fitzgerald, in the report of the Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct, concluded that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The true choice may be between the society altered by legislative or executive action to the extent which is necessary to hamper the misuse of civil privileges by criminals, or a society altered by those criminals and their activities . . . It might be preferable to have a limited qualification of rights so that they can be enjoyed in the freer atmosphere of a fairer more honest and honourable society.</PARA>
<PARA>I should also add that an officer who sought to deal in narcotics outside the course of duty would face the normal penalties for narcotics trafficking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Federal law enforcement officers are already subject to a strict disciplinary regime. Australian Federal Police officers, who will play the leading role in most operations, are subject to disciplinary and criminal penalties for misconduct under both the AFP Act and the AFP (Discipline) Regulations. AFP officers are employed on contract and can be summarily dismissed in cases of misconduct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Sercombe) proposed that judges authorise the controlled operations. This question was in fact addressed at length during the debate in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2925"> the Senate. The outcome of the debate was that the Democrats, who had pressed amendments to require judicial authorisation, were persuaded that the proposal was unwise and withdrew the amendments. The difficulties with the proposal were well expressed by Senator Cooney in the debate on 29 May when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think no judge should be brought before a court and cross&hyphen;examined as to why he or she believes that a person is likely to commit an offence.</PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for Maribyrnong also proposed that a parliamentary committee should review the provisions after some years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation will be reviewed by the courts very soon after it commences operations. There are prosecutions on foot at the moment that will almost certainly result in the testing of provisions. This is a more effective and more immediate form of scrutiny than that which is proposed by the honourable member. The honourable member is also most likely aware that the High Court is at present considering a case which involves debate about the propriety of judges performing non&hyphen;judicial functions. I refer to the case involving argument about the appointment of Judge Jane Mathews to conduct the Hindmarsh Bridge inquiry. This is an emerging issue and it would be premature to establish a review mechanism now. It is possible that some kind of major review, possibly by the ALRC or by a parliamentary committee, will be needed once the issues have fully emerged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) made great play of the possible budget cuts to the NCA. He would know that I can provide no details of any budget proposals involving the NCA or any other agency. Obviously, we must wait for details of the budget which will be delivered on 20 August. However, any cuts to the NCA will in any event be considered in the light of the functions which are performed by the range of Commonwealth and state law enforcement agencies which have a role in the struggle against the importation of illicit narcotics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government's report, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Review of Commonwealth Law Enforcement Arrangements</EMPHASIS>, identified the need to `eliminate perceived duplications of roles that existed between the NCA and the AFP.' This would offer the opportunity to make savings without an effect upon the performance of functions. The honourable member must not assume that any cuts to the funding of the NCA, if in fact there are any, will necessarily have a negative effect upon the efficiency of the struggle against crime and the importation of illicit narcotics in particular.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Proposed section 15U will require the tendering of the certificate. During the debate in the Senate an amendment to insert a new section 15U, which deals with the tendering of evidentiary certificates, was carried. Such a provision was not included in the bill presented by the government because it was felt to be unnecessary. It is inevitable that the fact of a controlled operation will be apparent to the defence in any trial depending upon such evidence. The defence will then have the right to oppose the admissibility of the evidence by challenging the authorisation procedure. This would be done in most cases by way of a voir dire. However it does not damage the bill to include specific requirements that the prosecution tender the certificate thus putting the defence on notice that evidence resulting from a controlled operation will be adduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 15U is somewhat imperfect in that the section, on its face, requires that a certificate authorising a controlled operation is to be tendered in evidence in `a prosecution for an offence against section 233B of the Customs Act 1901'. Needless to say, many prosecutions for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2926"> offences under section 233B of the Customs Act will arise which do not depend on any evidence gathered through a controlled operation. In many cases there will be no certificate to present.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My department is confident that the court will apply commonsense principles of interpretation to the operation of section 15U and will not require the tendering of a certificate in a trial where no controlled operation is being conducted. The requirement to tender the certificate will arise only in those cases where evidence is to be led by the prosecution which has been obtained through the conduct of a controlled operation. I again thank honourable members for their valuable contributions to this debate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The comments made today by the honourable member for Moore have basically been highlighting the need for better law enforcement mechanisms and for more resources so that that can be undertaken. Quite frankly, I find it quite extraordinary that he has expressed those concerns but now wants to obstruct the passage of the legislation, which is supported by both the government and the opposition, to give the Commissioner of the AFP very necessary powers to deal with police corruption. His actions are inconsistent with his words. I therefore present the explanatory memorandum of the bill and proceed to the second reading.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Vigilance against police corruption is an ongoing issue for Australian governments and the public at large. The more important provisions of this bill are focused on ensuring that the Australian Federal Police remains corruption free. A similar bill lapsed earlier this year due to the federal election. The government has decided to introduce a bill in a similar form to provide the necessary armoury to combat corruption within the Australian Federal Police.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members will be aware that the royal commission into the New South Wales Police Service has uncovered distressing instances of corruption and other serious misconduct. Such abuse of power and of the community's trust can never be tolerated in any police service. I know all members were distressed to hear that serving and former members of the Australian Federal Police have been implicated in corruption and other reprehensible behaviour. The government and the administration of the Australian Federal Police are strongly committed to ensuring that it is never debilitated by a culture of corruption and misconduct.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2927">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The institutional culture of a police force is of vital importance to a community. A police force stands at the threshold of the criminal justice system and is in effective control of the enforcement of the criminal law. Each police officer has an extensive authority over all other citizens, coupled with a wide discretion over its exercise. Subsequent stages in the criminal justice process, including courts and prisons, are largely dependent on the activities of police services and will inevitably be affected by their deficiencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth is, of course, particularly dependent on the integrity and efficiency of the Australian Federal Police. First, it is the principal agency for the general enforcement of the Commonwealth's criminal laws. It provides a vital link in effective cooperation with international law enforcement bodies. It is essential that the Australian Federal Police maintains the confidence of these bodies as well as the public's confidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1989, the parliament, with the support of all parties, substantially amended the Australian Federal Police Act 1979. The reforms were designed, in part, to introduce a new and unique employment scheme which would inhibit the occurrence of patterns of corruption uncovered in other police services. One aspect of these reforms was the replacement of tenure with a system of fixed term appointments. Another aspect was providing the commissioner with chief executive powers in relation to appointments within the Australian Federal Police, including the power to end the appointment of any police member or civilian staff member.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the principles underlying this employment scheme is that the commissioner should have a clear and specific responsibility for the integrity and operational efficiency of the Australian Federal Police. Naturally, the scheme also envisaged that the commissioner should have the powers and authority necessary to fulfil these responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At present, the commissioner's power to terminate the appointment of members or staff members of the Australian Federal Police is subject only to two exceptions. The current legislation states that the commissioner must not make use of this power merely because a disciplinary charge has been or could be laid or a court has convicted or found the person guilty of a criminal offence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These exceptions were provided in order to separate the Australian Federal Police's disciplinary processes&mdash;which can result in dismissal as a penalty for a disciplinary offence&mdash;from the commissioner's general power to end a person's appointment. In practice, the limitations on the commissioner's power of dismissal can lead to situations which are clearly inconsistent with the policy aims of the AFP employment scheme. For example, it is not clear that the commissioner can terminate the appointment of a member of the Australian Federal Police even if the member admits publicly that he or she is guilty of corruption or other serious reprehensible behaviour. To dismiss that person from the Australian Federal Police, it might be necessary for the commissioner either to invite the member to resign voluntarily or to initiate disciplinary proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The commissioner's hands could be equally tied if the person were to be convicted of serious criminal offences by a court. The government believes that this situation is unsatisfactory. Corruption in a police service can seriously undermine the professional self&hyphen;respect and morale of the decent and honest police who comprise the majority of members. It can also seriously diminish public confidence in the affected police service, something that may now be apparent in respect of the New South Wales Police Service. Immediate and effective action may be the only way to minimise the harm. On occasions, it will not be desirable to wait for lengthy disciplinary or court proceedings to be finally resolved before taking action.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2928">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed amendments will remove the limitations on the commissioner's powers of dismissal which relate to disciplinary offences and criminal convictions. The intention is to give the commissioner a broader and more effective power to end an appointment where the commissioner has lost confidence in a person's suitability for continued employment in the Australian Federal Police. The amendments will, in particular, permit the commissioner to act quickly and decisively to end the appointment of a person where the commissioner believes on reasonable grounds that there has been corruption, serious abuse of power or serious dereliction of duty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the government believes it is necessary in the public interest for the commissioner to have a wide discretion to end appointments, it also recognises that the employment rights of individual members and staff members within the Australian Federal Police should also be protected. Currently, members and staff members are protected in two ways in the event that they are retired by the commissioner before the end of their terms of appointment. Firstly, people who are retired may seek judicial review by the Federal Court of the commissioner's decision to end their appointments. Secondly, retired people are entitled to compensation for the lost part of their appointments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As this bill will widen the scope of the commissioner's powers to end appointments, the government believes it is also reasonable to extend to members and staff members additional remedies against the possibility that the commissioner's power might be exercised unfairly or unreasonably. The government has been at pains to find an appropriate balance between the public interest in maintaining a corruption free Australian Federal Police and the rights of the individual member or staff member who may be retired early either because of allegations of corruption or for other reasons, such as inefficiency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, in reconsidering this bill, I focused on the need for appropriate safeguards to protect innocent members and staff members. The government has decided that, in addition to the existing protective measures I have outlined, individual members and staff members who have their appointments terminated early will also have access to merit reviews before the Industrial Relations Commission and the Industrial Relations Court. At present, the Australian Federal Police are excluded from those unlawful termination provisions by the industrial relations regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Honourable members will no doubt be aware that, under the government's industrial relations reforms, it is proposed that the Industrial Relations Court be abolished and for the industrial relations jurisdiction to be conferred instead on the Federal Court. The government intends to repeal the relevant industrial relations regulation, subject to transitional and savings provisions, with effect from the date that the amendments in this bill come into force, and that is 28 days after royal assent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill makes one exception to the opening of the unfair dismissal remedies to the Australian Federal Police. This is where serious misconduct is involved. The bill provides that, where a person's appointment has been ended because of their conduct or behaviour, the commissioner may make a declaration that the conduct or behaviour amounts to serious misconduct and that the serious misconduct is having, or is likely to have, a damaging effect on professional self&hyphen;respect or morale within the Australian Federal Police or on its reputation with the public or with an Australian or overseas government or law enforcement agency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Serious misconduct is defined in the bill to mean corruption, serious abuse of power, serious dereliction of duty or any other serious reprehensible behaviour. Where a declaration of this <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2929"> kind is made, the person who has been retired will be excluded from the operation of the Industrial Relations Act provisions concerning unlawful dismissal, and will not be able to obtain merit review. Such persons, however, will retain the present right to compensation for their early retirement and to seek judicial review of the commissioner's declaration, as well as the decision to end their appointment. Also, a person subject to a declaration of serious misconduct will be able to seek a statement of reason in relation to the commissioner's decision to make the declaration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, where the reasons would disclose information that would not be in the public interest to disclose&mdash;for example, operationally sensitive information such as the identity of informants or current investigations&mdash;the Attorney&hyphen;General may, in the public interest, issue a certificate under subsection 14(1) of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 preventing disclosure of that information. This solution reaches an appropriate balance between the public interest in maintaining a corruption free Australian Federal Police and the rights of the individual.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have indicated, the commissioner will be able to make a declaration only where the commissioner believes on reasonable grounds that there has been serious misconduct by the person who is retired. It is also necessary that the commissioner believes that the serious misconduct is actually damaging, or is likely to damage, the Australian Federal Police in one of the ways I have described.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, these are special circumstances. They are circumstances in which immediate action by the commissioner is needed to maintain the internal integrity or the public reputation of the Australian Federal Police, and where it is not appropriate that an outside tribunal may be able to remake the commissioner's decision. The amendment will permit the commissioner to make a declaration either before or after the behaviour or conduct in question becomes widely known. This is to allow the commissioner to act to pre&hyphen;empt the threatened damage to the morale or reputation of the Australian Federal Police.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also contains several minor amendments concerning two separate matters. One group of amendments is intended to give the Governor&hyphen;General the power to authorise the commissioner and the deputy commissioners to appoint or promote persons as commissioned officers with the Australian Federal Police. At present the legislation permits the Governor&hyphen;General to give this authority only to the commissioner. The new arrangements are administratively more convenient. The amendments allow for appropriate safeguards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second group of amendments deals with the disciplinary obligations of staff members when granted special leave of absence for service with an industrial association. The effect is to extend the existing provisions which deal with members to staff members, as well. I commend the bill to the Main Committee.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition supports this bill. It is fair to say, I think, that the poor old government does not have much on its plate in the way of legislation so it has been picking up, in the main, the legislation of the previous government, and that is what this bill basically is. Apart from some minor procedural amendments that were made to the 1995 bill, this bill is substantially the bill that the Labor party introduced before the election, and the party supports wholeheartedly an expedited passage of the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been the New South Wales royal commission, which not only disclosed that there has been widespread corruption within the New South Wales police force but also adversely referred to a number of officers of the Australian Federal Police; there has been a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2930"> parliamentary committee in Western Australia that has recently reported to the Western Australian parliament; and, of course, there was the celebrated Fitzgerald inquiry in Queensland. In the light of all those inquiries, we can no longer say that either the state or the federal police forces are lilywhite. I think it is on that basis that this bill comes before the parliament. It makes it easier for a member or a staff member to be dismissed by reason of serious misconduct, regardless of whether that conduct may amount to a breach of the Australian Federal Police (Discipline) Regulations, either directly or as a result of a criminal conviction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that there has been concern expressed by members of the Australian Federal Police that they could be unduly or hastily dealt with under this legislation, but the opposition has looked at those concerns and believes that there are balances in the bill and remedies that officers can take if they believe they have been wrongly dismissed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the bill is fair in the current climate, and the second reading speech of the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull), who is at the table, highlights it. The intention is to give the commissioner a broader and more effective power to end an appointment where the commissioner has lost confidence in a person's suitability for continued employment in the Australian Federal Police. The amendment will, in particular, permit the commissioner to act quickly and decisively to end the appointment of a person where the commissioner believes, on reasonable grounds, that there has been corruption, serious abuse of power or serious dereliction of duty.</PARA>

Then it goes on to detail what those additional remedies are. The opposition's view is that there is some balance in this bill, and it is appropriate that the commissioner have these powers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, there is no need for me to take up my allotted time. Our view, as an opposition, is that we welcome the bill that is before the Committee.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, in relation to the Australian Federal Police Amendment Bill, it has been said that Australians are becoming increasingly cynical about the society in which they live. Evidence suggests that Australians are less community minded than they were in the past, that they trust one another less and that they put less faith in traditional institutions. The family, the church, the media, the state and federal parliaments and even the judiciary have all, arguably, seen a deterioration in their public image in recent years. Likewise, the police force has experienced its share of criticism and has withstood numerous accusations ranging from racism to corruption.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bodies such as the Fitzgerald inquiry in Queensland and the current Wood royal commission in New South Wales have partially eroded public confidence in our systems of law enforcement. This comes at a time when law and order rates highly on the list of community concerns. As the shadow minister at the table would fully understand, in recent election campaigns, at both state and federal levels, law and order issues have rated very highly on the political agenda. There is a widespread fear that the criminal justice system fails to punish <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2931"> serious crime effectively. There is also an understanding out there that criminals receive light sentences and the streets are no longer safe, as they were. That is the perception that members of the public have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Confidence in law enforcement is ultimately the difference between a civil and peaceful society and complete lawlessness. For this reason, the confidence of the Australian people in the integrity of their police force is of vital importance. It behoves the elected representatives of the Australian people to support, defend and express their confidence in the police force. I put on the public record my support for that view. Members of parliament, both state and federal, should be seen to be supporting the police force in its operation and, I think, in both a moral and a personal way, should help the police to enforce the laws that are created by these parliaments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This, of course, includes ensuring that the police force remains corruption free and that it has the ability to quickly respond to any suggestion of corruption or serious misconduct. This bill is aimed at avoiding a culture of corruption and misconduct in the Australian Federal Police. While the Wood royal commission in New South Wales has uncovered disturbing allegations of corruption in that state's police force, present and former members of the Australian Federal Police have also been implicated and named before the commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Against that backdrop, this bill empowers the Australian Federal Police Commissioner to dismiss police officers in cases of corruption or serious misconduct. Until now, there has been some doubt as to whether an officer of the Australian Federal Police could be sacked, even if they had been found guilty of a criminal charge. The officer would need to resign voluntarily or face disciplinary hearings, but the ability of the Australian Federal Police to move swiftly and effectively was compromised. This is an attitude of the public sector, and this bill really brings about quite a dramatic change to that attitude. Now the commissioner will be able to deal with any suggestion of wrongdoing in the Australian Federal Police and restore public confidence with decisive action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will provide some limited access to the unfair dismissal provisions of the Industrial Relations Act, except in cases of corruption, serious abuse of power or serious dereliction of duty. While protection from unfair dismissal may be fair enough for most employees, clearly there must be a different set of rules for the police force. The community demands that swift action be available to dismiss police officers with a proven tainted record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can you imagine what would happen if the former Labor government's unfair dismissal laws applied to the police force? In the case of these unfair dismissal laws, we have seen cases where workers have stolen, lied, accessed confidential files for personal use and been abusive to clients and seriously disloyal to the employer, and the Industrial Relations Court has reinstated them with back pay and compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As members of the former government would understand, the Howard government does not agree with this unfair dismissal procedure and is very unhappy with the consequences: it was about $7,000 for every dismissal. It was better, in most cases, for the employer to pay the money because that is what it would finally cost, no matter what the reality of the case was, because of the legality of the unfair dismissal arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Federal Police and the state police forces need to be well equipped to respond to any suggestion of serious misconduct with very swift action, and not have to put up with the unfair dismissal procedures. For minor allegations, the police officers will be protected by the unfair dismissal provisions in the new Industrial Relations Act, where it is appropriate.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2932">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important, and the government would agree, that any termination of a police officer's employment by the police commissioner must be on reasonable grounds. Obviously, there is an area for debate about that, as always in terms of dismissal, but in terms of keeping the integrity of the force, be it federal or state, these provisions are sensible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Federal Police is the principal law enforcement agency of the Commonwealth; it is the federal force in charge of policing breaches of the laws of the Commonwealth. Aside from investigations relating to offences against Commonwealth law, the Australian Federal Police provides a community policing role in the ACT. The headquarters are located in Canberra, with regional commands in states and territories. There are nearly 3,000 members of the force in 31 Australian offices and 15 overseas bureaus. There are also Australian Federal Police representatives attached to Interpol headquarters. Members of the force have been involved in the UN peacekeeping operations in Cyprus, Mozambique, Cambodia and Somalia. The operations of some aspects of the Australian Federal Police are quite extensive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The operational priorities of the Australian Federal Police are to provide the best in prevention, detection and investigation of criminal offences against the Commonwealth, with particular emphasis on organised crime and strategic intelligence, and to provide leadership in the Australian law enforcement effort. The federal police has cooperative relationships with the National Crime Authority, the Commonwealth Law Enforcement Board and state police agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As an aside, it has always been my view that this cooperation between the Australian police force and the state police agencies is an important aspect. Most Australian citizens really deal on a day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day basis with state police agencies, whereas the federal jurisdiction in terms of its moral influence and its enforcement is somewhat removed from the day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day operations of the average citizen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been previous reforms of the Australian police force structure aimed at stamping out corruption, which is certainly grabbing the headlines both in New South Wales and Victoria. In 1989, the parliament legislated to replace tenure for Australian Federal Police officers with a series of fixed appointments which, it seems to me, would be a step in the right direction. The commissioner was also given limited ability to end appointments for misconduct. The legislation builds further on that reform by strengthening the hand of the commissioner to dismiss police officers in such troublesome circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In February this year, the then Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) announced the completion of an enterprise agreement with the Australian Federal Police Association. I totally support that approach, in line with our industrial relations legislation, and I am pleased that the former minister was able to complete that enterprise agreement. Part of that package was a six per cent increase in salary, an increase in part&hyphen;time and job&hyphen;sharing work, working from home and other flexible working arrangements. Again, this is very compatible with the new industrial relations workplace bill that the Howard government has introduced into the House of Representatives and is now debating in that chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to the press release, the number of jobs performing routine or processing functions will be reduced and the emphasis will be on multiskilled, flexible units. Pay will be based on responsibilities of roles rather than a rank-based system. Again, this is compatible with the philosophy of the Howard government's industrial relations approach based on ability and merit rather than on an award and rank system, as it would be in the Federal Police. So there is a more productive and flexible arrangement of workplace arrangements by the Federal Police <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2933"> compatible with the general thrust of the government's industrial relations bill before the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Additional measures are agreed to in order to combat potential corruption. The press release is suggesting that there is a greater risk of corruption where some of the Australian Federal Police are isolated in longstanding squads or task forces in remote areas, or handling particular tasks. The federal police have recognised this and are moving away from static squads of the past to a more flexible system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think these reforms are timely not only in terms of the context of the debates here in the parliament but also in terms of debates on the police forces around Australia. This is a step in the right direction. Unfortunately, the Federal Police have been involved in some of the arguments and debates in the Wood royal commission in New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In September last year, the commission heard that an elite joint task force consisting of Australian Federal Police members and New South Wales Drug Squad detectives had allegedly stolen $200,000 worth of drug money after an operation in 1983. The money had been seized as part of a raid but never submitted as evidence. Allegedly, it was split amongst the members of the joint task force. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> of 27 September 1995 reported that one of the secret witnesses told the commission that he had seen a psychiatrist and was suffering moral collapse after accepting $10,000 which had been stolen from the drug traffickers. Allegedly, the witness had found an envelope stuffed with $20 and $50 notes in his drawer at the joint task force headquarters at Kings Cross. After leaving it in his drawer for a number of days, he eventually took the money home and hid it in his sports bag. He reported that he was suffering moral tensions and a festering sore in his subconscious ever since he had been involved in part of that corruption. Unfortunately, in this case, the Federal Police officers were caught in an isolated situation of corruption stemming from the joint operation with the New South Wales police force. This took place some time ago but it does add to the public perception and concern about the general performance of police forces around Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will conclude by reiterating my belief that members of all parliaments should try to support members of the police force. They, like members of the parliament, are public persons and often many of the middle&hyphen;of&hyphen;the&hyphen;road police officers are wrongly accused of being part of the total so&hyphen;called corruption of some of the forces. My own exposure in Victoria suggests that the police force in that state is fairly good. Chief Commissioner Comrie has taken every effort to enforce the law, as the law&hyphen;makers have put it forward in the parliaments, in a day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day operation to ensure that crime is kept to a minimum. It is a difficult task. I have heard Commissioner Comrie give some private remarks about the operation of the police force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I observe that certain media outlets emphasise the deficiencies of the police force and give undue coverage of that, compared to other elements of the society who enjoy certain notoriety about activities relating to police shootings and activities related to civil liberties groups. I draw the attention of the parliament to the disparity in some of these public arguments between the position of the Victorian police force and what the chief commissioner might have to say, as compared to what some civil liberty groups might put forward as their position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the Victorian police force, which as a Victorian I have some day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day contact with, has done a pretty good job. The police officers that I have dealt with are conscientious. They conduct themselves in a civil manner, executing the laws in terms of traffic offences and in terms of&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, in relation to the Federal Police force, which we are talking about, this bill brings about a change of attitude&mdash;that if they do not do the right thing the chief commissioner has the capacity to make a change dramatically in removing personnel. That will help with the general perception that the chief commissioner can move and make the changes if he so wishes. I concede that there are a couple of downsides, based on the fact that he may move peremptorily. But, on balance, I think the chief commissioner needs this power.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just want to make a couple of comments. I indicated earlier that I was going to move to have the matter referred to the main chamber and I have considered that in more detail. I was interested in the comments made by the minister at the table. I think he was perhaps not being serious when he suggested that impeding the bill's progress through the Main Committee was somehow going to impede its progress as a piece of legislation through the parliamentary process, which is obviously not true.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support the bill and I support the bill's intentions. I just make the comment that the bill was introduced into the Senate. One of the reasons for that is that the Senate has a standing order that requires bills originating in the House to be presented by 30 May in order for them to be considered by the Senate within a particular time frame. One of the consequences of the relatively late start of this new parliament has been that bills which must desperately be passed&mdash;and I consider this to be one of them&mdash;have to be introduced in the Senate. Otherwise they will end up in the Senate backlog of legislation and not be dealt with for some time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I can just paraphrase the words of Winston Churchill, it is probably fair to say, in relation to police and the criminal justice system, that Australia's criminal justice system is probably the worst in the world, apart from all the others. I make that comment in view of the fact that, of all the police and criminal justice models around the world, the Australian one does have some particularly strong advantages. Of course, it has disadvantages, and disadvantages are highlighted in this particular bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the work of a colleague, the former independent member for the South Coast, John Hatton, who served for some considerable time in the New South Wales parliament. He pursued the issue of police corruption in New South Wales almost incessantly, to the extent that he was able to cause to be initiated a royal commission into the New South Wales police force. He pursued that against the backdrop of considerable criticism from both sides of politics. In the last phase of his career in the New South Wales parliament, he was given a pretty hard time and was considered by some to be almost obsessive in his pursuit of that particular objective. If anybody is a hero of modern times in relation to our criminal justice system, then John Hatton, the former independent member for the South Coast, is one of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A police force, more often than not, reflects the society which it serves; another truism that is reflected in the bill. We face considerable difficulties in our community at present with behaviour&mdash;that is, what is considered to be acceptable behaviour in relation to what is considered to be, let us say, a fair return for one's effort. The whole of the service of police force members around the country has to be taken into consideration against that backdrop. In other words, you get the police force you deserve. We must, as a community, ensure that our police forces around the country are operating to the highest possible standards. However, in parts of the country, there are serious concerns and, unfortunately, as the member for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2935"> Corangamite (Mr McArthur) has indicated, those concerns reflect on every member of the police force. That is an extraordinary imposition on the men and women who diligently serve their communities as police officers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a community that every night of the week watches television programs with police themes: cop dramas. The community is fed a perception about police behaviour and police techniques that is often wildly different from the reality of day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day policing. One of my favourite programs is <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Bill</EMPHASIS>. It is probably the police drama that most closely reflects actual police work. That is because it looks at the day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day operation of a police station and, of course, the interaction of police officers as a consequence. More recent Australian dramas such as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Blue Heelers</EMPHASIS> have, I think, given a much greater and more realistic, sometimes gritty, feel to the reality of day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day policing in a modern Australian society. Some of the shows that were on television when I first arrived in this country, including <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Homicide</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Division 4</EMPHASIS>, were romanticised to a large extent, probably reflecting the romantic view that people had of the police forces. After all, a police force, as I mentioned, reflects the community. As communities develop, there is a pressure on police forces to develop as a consequence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clear from the Wood royal commission that, in the case of the Australian Federal Police and, of course, the New South Wales police, there are significant problems with corruption. There have been significant allegations and compelling evidence, I would have thought, of corruption. Quite clearly, it requires a sensible resolution and this bill provides that, particularly in relation to the role of the commissioner of police as the chief executive officer of a modern police force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I first joined the police force in Western Australia, the commissioner was probably second only to the Premier in terms of the perception of the role as a significant public official. I certainly remember, when I first joined, that the commissioner was seen in a sort of revered way, up on the horizon, somebody of considerable authority. That authority, when I was a junior policeman, was very strong in the force. In fact, the commissioner had quite extraordinary powers to dismiss police officers whom he or his advisers considered to be unsuitable to remain in the force. It is obvious that, if you have a situation where human beings are police officers, you are going to get human problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I spoke earlier about the insidious problem of drug importation and drug trafficking in our community. The problem is probably compounded by the extraordinary and enormous rewards that can be achieved by those who participate in that sort of criminal behaviour. You have a situation wherein the police forces are rubbing up against this sort of corrupt, criminal, conspiratorial behaviour. They see the rewards. The problem is that in some instances, as we have clearly seen in the Wood royal commission, the temptation is overpowering. It is clear that we have to deal with this, as a community, in a way that properly reflects the reality of the situation.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QT4">Mr FILING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member makes a comment about the reform of drug laws. There is some scope for the reform of certain drug laws. But, in the final analysis, if there is a profit it does not matter what sort of drug it is; whether it is marijuana, an amphetamine or one of the latest chemical drugs. It does not matter what they are; where there is a criminal profit to be gained, you are going to have people attracted into participating.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen people who were even prepared to risk their lives to bring back drugs from South&hyphen;East Asia, knowing that they were facing the possibility of a death sentence. They are </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2936">
<PARA>so significantly attracted towards the profit, through their own drug addiction or just through sheer greed, that they are prepared to risk their lives&mdash;and, in many cases, risk 30 years in some of the worst prison conditions in the world&mdash;in order to either make that profit or feed their own drug needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clear that, in modern policing and the reform of modern policing, there is a need for greater visibility and scrutiny. If that requires the sort of authority that this bill provides the commissioner of the Australian Federal Police with, then that is absolutely necessary. In some ways, it probably reflects some of the past standing of commissioners of police as being people with considerable authority in directing the day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day operations of their forces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The independence of the police force is a very important facet of the balances within our criminal justice system. In more recent times, some of this independence has been imposed upon. I believe that is to the detriment of a better and more responsive, efficient and decent police force effort around the country. In particular, in the case of the Australian Federal Police, the role of the commissioner is absolutely critical. The commissioner's role should be as independent as is possible within the relationship between the commissioner's office, the minister and the parliament to whom the minister is responsible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of rewards, one of the areas that I have wanted to see changed and enhanced is that of the remuneration and benefits that are available to police officers in our day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day community. After all, when police officers are well paid, in relative terms, compared to other members of the community, and they are secure in their employment in terms of doing the right thing, getting the job done properly and being decent and honest members of the force, obviously that is a greater deterrent to succumbing to the attractions of criminal profits or becoming involved in conspiracies with organised crime or other criminals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is something that we all have to look at. If we want to have police forces that are going to be impeccable, efficient, responsive and answerable to the community, we ought to make sure that not only are we getting the best possible personnel into those forces but also they are well renumerated for their work, so that they are seen within the community as being higher than perhaps they have been in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the last 20 to 30 years, the standing of police officers in the community was reduced steadily until they became, in many cases, the butt of abuse. To refer to my own particular experience, I can recollect that, when I first joined the job, in social terms a police officer was almost seen as a pariah. If you turned up to a social gathering, it was almost as though you had suddenly put the pall of doom over it. Of course, people started whispering in corners&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps they were using all those drugs!</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QT4">Mr FILING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is an interesting observation; perhaps the member could expand on that, at a later stage, from his own personal observations. I agree that it is a question of perception and myth. We took on the British police model as our role model in the formation of our Australian police forces. We adopted, changed and developed that within the Australian context, both in the states and nationally, with the Australian Federal Police acting as the federal police force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amongst those things that we took on, as opposed to other police jurisdictions around the world, was the concept that a police officer should be a part of the community, interact with the community and live in the community, as opposed to the barrack style police forces on the mainland of Europe and elsewhere. I must say that I think that is one of the great advantages. Community`visibility is absolutely critical. One of the things that is occurring in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2937"> some police jurisdictions is the bringing of detectives back into uniform so that they are visible going about their duties. It is something that in the past I have opposed but, in the light of some of the circumstances of recent times, I think it helps the visibility of police practices and helps the community and the police to interact to ensure that they have very high standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other aspect is the scrutiny of the courts. I have to commend the former Minister for Justice, the member for Denison (Mr Kerr), on this issue. Some years back, when he first introduced the requirement for Australian Federal Police officers to videotape interviews, I was a critic of his. I thought that at times, particularly in remote areas of Australia, videotaping would pose significant problems of access, facilities, distance and time involved after apprehending a suspect, interviewing, and going through the further processes that are applicable under the relevant statutes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This, I believe, has now proved to be a significant advantage. It has enhanced police work. It has also meant, in the context of prosecution of cases in the courts, that the courts are able to see the accused at the point when they are being interviewed by the police in a way that often reveals more about them than mountains and mountains of written or oral evidence could possibly do. I would say from my discussions with other police officers, particularly the ones I consider to be thoughtful about these processes, that I believe that they are all in agreement with the changes that have been brought in, in particular the changes relating to videotaping of interviews. Also, videotaping is a critical part of the element of visibility, which I mentioned earlier. It means that people can see the process, with the benefit of hindsight to a certain extent. It is there on the record in physical evidence, visual and in sound. That is something that permits the courts to have a greater scrutiny of police practices and police behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I reiterate some of the comments made earlier in relation to cuts. But, if we are going to have a police force and an Australian Federal Police that is going to be effective, it has to be as independent as possible. In other words, within the communal justice system it must be able to exercise its statutory responsibilities in a way that is consistent with the basic principles of a proper, responsive criminal justice system. Also, it is not to be interlinked or merged in joint standing facilities with other agencies. That is something I have criticised in the past; it is something from the former Minister for Justice that I have criticised. I felt that the joint standing operations between the NCA and the Australian Federal Police were to the detriment of both organisations. I believe that each should be self&hyphen;standing and clearly separated so that they are clearly answerable in their own ways to their own particular statutes and, at the end of the day, via the minister, to the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our processes are critical to a criminal justice system. It is fair to say that in the past, particularly in New South Wales, if the legislators had been more diligent in looking over the operations of the New South Wales Police, we would have had a different situation. There were all sorts of allegations in the 1950s, the 1960s, the 1970s and the 1980s in relation to the interlinking of corrupt behaviour in the police and some of the political figures of the times. But it is fair that we must ensure that the police force's activities, its responsiveness, its efficiency, its effects, and its method of operations are as clearly visible as possible so that the community can see, to their satisfaction or otherwise, that they are getting a service that they deserve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said at the beginning that you get the police force you deserve. If we have got police forces that are less than satisfactory, we have to look back at our own community and we have to make the decision to reform the police forces in ways that are consistent with what we ask <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2938"> the community to do themselves. After all, police officers are human beings. A vast majority of them around the country perform their duties honestly and decently, as best they can. In many cases, as we saw recently with the Port Arthur massacre and in other instances, they go far beyond the call of duty to provide services that many other citizens would probably find themselves completely unable to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We ask them to do that on our behalf. In order to ensure that they have the standing in the community, we have got to ensure that they are able to work in the sorts of administrative and organisational settings that enhance their honesty and their commitment to their work, and at the end of the day give the public the satisfaction that it is getting the best possible police service that it deserves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend this bill to the Main Committee. As I mentioned earlier, it is important that this bill is passed as soon as possible. As a consequence I have refrained from referring it back to the main chamber.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 1996 is designed to increase the size of the board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority by two: the present number of four lay members will be increased to six. The authority's Chief Executive Officer, Mr Leroy Keith, is also an ex officio member of the board. The bill is also designed to empower the minister to appoint one of the members of the board as a deputy chair of the board.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Briefly, the background to this legislation has to be seen in the context of the tragic disaster of the Monarch Airlines crash at Young in mid&hyphen;1993 and the subsequent Bureau of Air Safety Investigation report into that crash. That led to the then Minister for Transport, Mr Laurie Brereton, announcing that the government intended to separate the commercial and safety regulatory functions of the former Civil Aviation Authority into two separate bodies. The legislation to do so was announced by the then minister on 28 March 1995 and was passed by the parliament a couple of months later. As a result of that legislation, two separate bodies&mdash;Airservices Australia and the Civil Aviation Safety Authority&mdash;were created by the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The controversy which surrounded the previous Civil Aviation Authority has not died as a result of that decision. Still very much a live issue in debate, particularly within the aviation <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2939"> sector, are the questions associated with the safety regulatory functions performed by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority as it now is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new board of the authority took office on 1 July 1995. The four lay members who were appointed then and who are still in office are: the chair of the board, Mr Justice Bill Fisher, who is Chief Judge of the New South Wales Industrial Court as well; Ms Gaby Hollows, who is a consumer advocate; Dr Claire Pollock, who is a systems safety expert; and Mr Geoff Molloy, who is a former Qantas pilot. As I indicated, the director, Mr Leroy Keith, is an ex officio member of the board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Shortly after coming to office, the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, Mr Sharp, endeavoured to force the four members of the board to resign. He wrote letters to them individually seeking their resignations. He rang each of them individually seeking their resignations and at at least one meeting, and possibly more, collectively spoke to the board members asking them to resign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only reason that he gave at that point was, and I quote, `That I have obligations to other people.' Given that the board members had been in office for only about nine months, that there had been no substantive complaints levelled against them, and that the issues which arose from, for example, the BASI investigation into the Monarch disaster, predated their period on the board, it was rather a peculiar performance by the minister. In fact, he subsequently admitted that it would not go down as one of his best performances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He did point out, correctly, that the coalition policy prior to the election was to increase the amount of aviation expertise, or direct aviation industry background, represented on the board. This was a position that was strongly supported by the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, which strongly supported the coalition, and Mr Sharp in particular, during the election campaign. AOPA is headed by Mr Dick Smith and Mr Boyd Munro who is present here in the gallery today. It is fair to say that AOPA has been in substantial conflict with the former CAA and now its successor, CASA, over a wide range of safety regulation issues. A number of those issues have already been canvassed or dealt with by the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill has emerged ultimately because of the minister's failure to shift the existing board members. It is very disturbing that in presenting his ministerial statement to the parliament yesterday the minister made completely unsubstantiated statements to the effect that the existing board members were, `putting their own interests ahead of aviation safety.' These are fairly strong things to say about people who are performing a community function by representing the people of this country as board members on the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. It is a pretty strong accusation to make, without any substantial evidence to back it up, accusing them of putting their own self&hyphen;interests ahead of the interests of aviation safety in this country. It is something that I think the minister may well regret in the future when he reflects on it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition does not object to the content of the bill. It does not see a huge difference between four and six members of the board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. If you look at the range of memberships of various equivalent boards, you will see that the numbers vary quite a bit, that there is no golden or perfect number, and that both four and six members are equally acceptable. So the notion of increasing the size of the board does not attract any criticism from the opposition; it does not see that there is any optimum number for members of the board.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2940">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Equally, the opposition does not object to the notion that the two additional places should be used to place additional expertise or aviation industry background on the board. The opposition believes that such boards should have a balance between generalist expertise, such as that of some of the existing members of the board, and specialist expertise that is directly relevant to the area that is being regulated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of very interesting statements have been made by the minister on this issue. I think it is important to take a more sober view of the issue. For example, as I cited in the House yesterday, I doubt whether there are too many directors of BHP who grew up shovelling coal into steel furnaces or working as ironworkers. I note also, as I did yesterday, that the new head of the transport department, Dr Hawke, is in fact a geneticist by trade. I think it was an excellent appointment and it illustrates that there are many positions in the hierarchy in the public sector that should have a generalist rather than a direct specialist involved in the area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of the CASA board, I believe there should be a mix: some aviation specialists and some generalists. It is also important to mention, as the minister as failed to do, that one of the three members he says has no expertise in aviation does, in fact, have very directly relevant expertise in system safety, and that is Dr Claire Pollock. She studied under Professor James Reason, who has developed the methodology which is most widely acknowledged as the appropriate methodology for analysing disasters such as major airline crashes and who, I understand, headed the investigation into the Manchester plane disaster some years ago. So it is quite clear that one of those three does have directly relevant expertise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that the function of the CASA board is not to go out and inspect the planes or do the hands&hyphen;on work of the authority&mdash;which, quite appropriately, should be done by people with the directly relevant expertise&mdash;the function of the board is to ensure that the authority fulfils its obligations under the act of parliament which governs it. That is something which, I would have thought, a judge would be fairly well qualified to do, being somebody with substantial legal expertise. That supervisory role of the board, in a general sense, is quite different from the function of actually performing the task of safety regulation and administration that the authority itself does.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the substance of the legislation, the opposition does not object to the notion of the appointment of one of the board members as the deputy chair. From time to time, having a deputy chair will be of some consequence. A quick examination of similar boards, such as that of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, indicates that most similar boards under the Commonwealth umbrella have a position of deputy chair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is some controversy with respect to the prospect that the minister is endeavouring to create a position on the board for Dick Smith and, in doing so, to force out the existing board members by backdoor means because he is unable to do so by the front door. The second reading amendment which I hereby move is specifically designed to deal not only with that situation but also with the broader concern that the opposition has with respect to people who have a partisan position in the aviation industry being appointed to the board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition does not have any objection to Dick Smith as an individual. In fact, I have not met Mr Smith, although I have had several discussions with Mr Munro of the same organisation. So far, the indications are that I would probably agree with Mr Smith and Mr Munro on one or two issues. I certainly disagree with them on a number of others. The fact is, regardless of Mr Smith's position on any of these issues and whether he is right or wrong, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2941"> he is a very high profile and quite controversial campaigner within the aviation industry, campaigning on issues that directly relate to CASA's jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my view&mdash;regardless of whether I agree 100 per cent, or disagree 100 per cent, with him on those issues&mdash;it is inappropriate for anybody who plays or has recently played such a role to be appointed to the CASA board. Somebody who has been a highly partisan political lobbyist representing a section of the industry&mdash;regardless of who that might be&mdash;should not be appointed to what is basically an umpire's position. It is perfectly reasonable to have people with a background and expertise in the industry, as I indicated before, and I think Mr Molloy is a good example of that. But I and the opposition do not believe that it is appropriate for people who have been strong campaigners and political lobbyists on issues related to CASA's jurisdiction to be placed on the board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">CASA makes very difficult decisions and choices that affect people's lives and livelihoods. It would be inappropriate to have people on the board of CASA who have axes to grind. There is a serious risk that, if that occurs, the CASA board will turn into a battleground between competing interests in the aviation industry. This is another reason why it is appropriate to have at least some people on the board who do not come from the aviation industry itself, but have other relevant expertise. In summary, the opposition opposes any partisan advocate for any particular section of the aviation industry being represented directly on the CASA board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should also make it clear that the opposition does not agree with the general position that Mr Smith has been associated with on what is termed `affordable safety'. I will not repeat them today, but I will note the comments made&mdash;at pages 8, 50, 73 and 75&mdash;by the coroner who investigated the Monarch crash, with respect to the `affordable safety' philosophy and the impact that that had on the Civil Aviation Authority, as it then was.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is too early for me, as shadow minister for transport, to form conclusive views on the issue of to what extent the problems of the then Civil Aviation Authority were caused by that philosophy. In fact, it may be very difficult to form conclusive views at all, because these things are extremely complex. Certainly, the coroner's view was that that philosophy had a significant contributing impact on the Monarch crash, and I think we have to take some note of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that there is an inherent contradiction in the position of the minister on these issues. On one hand, he has been very strongly supportive of the agenda that Mr Smith and his organisation have put&mdash;for example, the overruling of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority on the question of electronic locater transmitters. So far, he has appeared to be very supportive, and that will be clearly evidenced if he does appoint Mr Smith to the board. On the other hand, he has taken a very strong and very vigorous position, particularly in opposition, with respect to the performance of the Civil Aviation Authority and then CASA, regarding rigorous safety enforcement. I would suggest to him that there is an inherent contradiction in those two points of view and that, at some point, that contradiction will hit home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now very briefly in conclusion to the amendment that I gather has been circulated by the honourable member for Calare (Mr Andren). This is at least the third such one, I think I am correct in saying. One was from the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), but they are all on the same issue; that is, giving the minister the capacity to dismiss the existing members of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority board. This particular amendment in effect gives the minister unrestricted power to dismiss the members of the board at any time, for no reason. The existing legislation specifies reasons, such as becoming of unsound mind <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2942"> or bankruptcy and the like, which are usually included for dismissal of members of boards of statutory authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment that has been moved by the member for Calare in effect would allow the minister unfettered power to dismiss board members. The opposition does not support this amendment; firstly, because it is directly targeted at removing existing board members where, as far as the opposition can see, there is no justification for doing so, since they have not done anything wrong in the discharge of their duties; and, secondly, particularly when the minister is pursuing another avenue which allows him to influence the composition of the board by adding two members. The opposition believes that this is completely unjustified in the specific circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More importantly, there is a broader principle here, and that is the whole question of the relationship between statutory authorities and the government. If you have a situation where the minister can arbitrarily dismiss board members&mdash;all of them, at any time, and for no reason&mdash;you have to question why you have a statutory authority in the first place and why, in this case, you do not simply return to the old department of transport situation where the conduct of civil aviation safety regulation is directly under ministerial control; because the net effect of having board members who are subject to instant dismissal is the same.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you apply this principle across the board to other statutory authorities, and if you do it here, you have to ask why you are not doing it elsewhere. If you apply it across the board, then you effectively negate one of the key components of the whole concept of a statutory authority which is, to some extent, to depoliticise the process that it is involved with and the obligations that it is there to discharge; to remove the political process a bit from that, without severing ultimate lines of accountability but still allowing the proper administration of that area to occur without direct day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day political interference. That is the whole purpose.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My final comments relate to the way the minister is dealing with the question of the current performance of the staff of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. It seems pretty clear that the staff of the former Civil Aviation Authority, several years ago, were derelict in their duty in a number of cases. You only have to read the coroner's report into the Monarch crash to see that that fairly clearly was the case. However, the minister has made a number of fairly flamboyant and rather reckless statements in recent times suggesting that this sort of conduct is continuing, that the same people are doing the same things. For example, in his statement yesterday, he said that he was concerned that the old culture still existed `despite the change of name', that existing CAA officers felt `somehow immune to the consequences of their own wrongdoing', and that the government would not be `repeating the errors of the previous government in allowing that attitude to continue uncorrected.'</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2943">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The disturbing conclusions that I have reached are twofold. First, continuing accusations are being levelled against existing officers, without people being named and without direct action being taken in any way against the individual officers. All of the officers are slurred as a result of that. Second, no evidence of existing contemporary failure, of the type which has been revealed to have occurred in 1993&hyphen;94, has been put forward. That is the first concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Second, there is no evidence that the minister is actually doing anything about this. If he believes that there are officers in CASA who are derelict in their duty, then he should be doing something about it. I doubt that expanding the board by two, even on the most optimistic view, will be a mechanism for doing something about that problem, if it does exist. All he said on that front was that he would be pursuing these matters with the director. I think he owes the parliament, the people of Australia, the people in the industry, and particularly the people in the authority, some more detailed explanation as to precisely what he believes is wrong here and now, who the people involved are and what he proposes to do about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very worrying that the minister continues to act as if he is the shadow minister. It is particularly worrying for the general reputation of safety regulation in this country that he is still undermining the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, still attacking it, when he is now the person responsible for it. He is no longer the shadow minister; he is the person responsible for the organisation. He needs to be a lot more careful in his statements and how he deals with these issues in the public arena, because he is now the minister. Unfortunately, I think he has yet to come to grips with that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition, as I indicated, does not oppose the bill, subject to the second reading amendment which I will move and which opposes the amendment which will be moved by the member for Calare (Mr Andren). I move:</PARA>

The economic rationalist government of the last 13 years, Mr Keating's government, introduced very doctrinaire, economic rationalist policies. It is interesting to hear the other side of the House refer to ideology. They have been the party driven by ideology and their ideology, amusingly for me, is inimical to the interests of the average working person whom they purport to represent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Civil aviation in Australia provides a good example of what is occurring. If you take the user&hyphen;pays principle and you apply it to the field of aviation, what happens is that Brisbane gets <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2944"> a $300 million airport&mdash;or $600 million, depending upon which newspaper report you want to read&mdash;which services overseas people or people who want to leave Australia and go overseas. They get a $300 million international terminal which would arguably be one of the more beautiful buildings, outside of our cathedrals, in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under this same principle, what happens in Mount Isa? Mount Isa is a town of 20,000 people that produces $1,500 million worth of export earnings for Australia every single year. What happens to the 20,000 of us&mdash;brave little souls that we are&mdash;who live out in this area? What happens in Mount Isa under the policies of the previous government? And I must say, in all fairness, that there are people on our side who adhere to the same sorts of policies of economic rationalism. So what I am attacking here is not so much the ALP but the economic rationalists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mount Isa, as I said, is producing $1,500 million of export earnings for Australia, with men risking their lives going into the depths of the earth daily in very hard conditions. I worked as a labourer there myself for a small but significant proportion of my life. It is hard work and it is dangerous work. To give just one example, every one of the people on my gang at the lead smelter at Mount Isa Mines had a lead count, with the exception of me.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Mount Isa there were 68 employees at the local airport. A number of them were employed on the fire brigade tender there. A number were employed in the control tower and a number were employed in maintenance to keep the airstrip in good working order. The terminal staff who keep the terminal clean and in good working order are still there and do an excellent job. All of the other people are gone. Where we had 68 employees at the Mount Isa airport, we now have two employees and one contractor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So if you are landing in Mount Isa, just hope and pray that nothing goes wrong because the nearest fire brigade tender is some 10 kilometres away, in the centre of the city. It might be more than 10 kilometres&mdash;I do not know how far it is. But it is a long way away. So if something goes wrong, say your prayers. In Mount Isa you just suffer, while people who are rich and want to go overseas have the magnificent $300 million terminal to enjoy. Overseas tourists are provided with that $300 million terminal. But the workers in Mount Isa who might want to go and visit their relatives on the coast, or who might have to go away for an operation or for treatment for lead poisoning, which was laughed at by the opposition people here&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They do not have any of the services enjoyed by the big city airports in Australia. That is what economic rationalism is all about. If you have not got the numbers, you get nothing; if you have got the numbers, you get everything. It is a `winner take all' situation. There is nothing at all for those who belong to minority groups and, by definition, people who live in a small centre outside a metropolitan city are a minority group.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I add that we have also lost our Qantas services to Mount Isa. This is partially due to the fringe benefits tax introduced by the ALP government that resulted in us having these pernicious fly&hyphen;ins and the change of policy by the state government. All the mining is now being done out of places such as Brisbane and Townsville. It is no longer being done on the ground and inland Australia is becoming a big empty shell.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That brings me to another aspect which is very important. One of my two offices is in Innisfail. If you head due west in an aeroplane from Innisfail for about 40 kilometres, the area is heavily populated. At about 40 or 50 kilometres from Innisfail, you cross the Great Dividing Range and there is nothing for the best part of 10,000 kilometres. There is no sign of human habitation when you look out either side of the aircraft. There might be an occasional water trough set up or an occasional fence line; it would be very doubtful that you would see any other sign of human habitation. You would have just flown over 60 per cent of Australia's arable land and 75 per cent of our water supply. Seventy&hyphen;five per cent of this nation's water supply is in that area of land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no excuse for this nation to be sitting on that huge resource that the good Lord has given us as Australians: to have done nothing at all with this is immoral, a terrible disgrace and a reflection upon every single person in this country. It is an indefensible position. In the world's tribunals, such as the United Nations, it is an indefensible position, when tonight people in so much of the world are going to bed hungry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because that area is empty, it is very important to aviation: if an aircraft gets into trouble, it is in a lot of trouble. You are in the middle of nowhere. There are no airstrips and what airstrips there are are not marked on maps. One of the issues that I have marked down here to raise today is the total inadequacy of maps in Australia; they simply do not have the airstrips at station properties marked on them. Sometimes, where they are marked, they are marked with extreme inaccuracy. We had a station property in that area and we changed the position of the airstrip, but I think it would still be desirable for both airstrips to appear on the map.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Accurate maps would be a very important thing to us. Automatic landing lights cost money, but I think the government could deliver them more cheaply than individual shire councils deliver them at present. Homing beacons are enormously important. I could be corrected here, but I do not think any of the towns along the pathway from Innisfail west to the Indian Ocean have homing beacons or automatic lights, which at night&hyphen;time can make the difference between staying alive and not staying alive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At a recent tribunal hearing, I had to submit my itineraries and I was quite amazed to find out that I was spending 43&half; hours per week travelling. Thanks to the `one vote, one value' imposed on us by the parliament, I represent 85,000 people; most people here represent about 70,000 people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to heaven that we had one vote, one value. Because I represent this huge area, almost all of that 43&half; hours travel is in light aircraft. Mr Deputy Speaker, on three occasions I have been in a light aircraft and we have lost a motor. We had very good pilots, we were very <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2946"> lucky, and we escaped from that situation. On another occasion there had been some bad navigation by a pilot. He was an experienced pilot, too, I might add. He missed where he should have been by nearly 150 kilometres. When you are starting to run low on fuel, when you have got absolutely no idea where you are and it is the middle of the night, it is a very dangerous situation. But, as luck would have it, we were close to a town, I was able to recognise what that town was, and we were able to find our way back again to civilisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But finding a little township, as we did on that occasion, is not very helpful. Landing in the main street at night would be extremely dangerous. But, if we had some system, or some device to switch on, whereby we knew where the airstrip was at these little towns, that would be of enormous benefit. In this case we were not close to a town where we could have switched on landing lights, but we were not far away. We were only about 40 kilometres away from a town where we could have switched on landing lights and found our way. But, at night, you have got nothing much that you can hold on to if you have not got the homing beacons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another issue which is vitally important in the area of civil aviation. If you read the Australian constitution, you will find that aviation is one of the heads of power which is the responsibility of the federal government. All of the airstrips in the electorate of Kennedy&mdash;every single airport, with one exception, I think&mdash;are imposed upon the local authority. There is nothing in the constitution about local authorities running airports or aviation; but again we had the economic rationalists and a really vicious decision by the then federal government of Mr Hawke forcing these local authorities to take on these airstrips. The federal government said, `We are pulling out. We are not going to put a single cent into these airstrips forever. So it is upon your head.'  I argued very strongly in the Queensland cabinet that the Queensland government ought to tell the federal government to go to hell and, if any accidents occurred, it would be upon the head of the federal government. The federal government has had the responsibility of looking after this area placed upon it by the people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some people may say, `With economic rationalism and user pays, if you cannot pay your way out there, do not live out there.'  Mr Deputy Speaker, they have put that proposition to us, and the net result of it has been that people out there have said, `All right; we cannot live out here. We are moving.' Thirty&hyphen;nine per cent of people in western Queensland have moved over the last 25 years, and they are running away just about as fast as their feet can carry them, thanks to the user&hyphen;pays principle and the principles of the economic rationalists. But, unfortunately, they are taking with them the wealth of this nation. This nation's biggest export earning item in l988 was wool, as it was for the 10 years prior to that&mdash;or neck and neck with coal, as it has been for all of our history. Half of our sheep herd has gone, and the numbers are falling dramatically right at this very moment. The cattle herd&mdash;the fifth biggest export earning item for this nation&mdash;is falling over.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The difficulties placed upon the mining industry by the Native Title Act that has been legislated into existence by this place, and the enormous power given to the extreme element of the green movement in Australia, have dealt death blows to the mining industry as well. Because of the fringe benefits tax and because of the user&hyphen;pays principle, there are very many things now in these areas that we are doing without. Let me come back to Mount Isa for one brief moment, because they are discussing industrial relations in the other place. Because of the fringe benefits tax and because of the government's policy of having high interest rates and a high Australian dollar, Mount Isa Mines has suffered enormous pain. The net result of that is that we lost our fly&hyphen;ins. One of the great advantages of working in Mount Isa was having your annual free holiday to Brisbane. Even though many people would consider Mount <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2947"> Isa a hostile living environment, I would not. It is my home. I love it, of course, and I enjoy it out there. But most people would say that living there is very difficult. So, when they lost the annual holiday flights, there was very strong persuasion and pressure put upon the residents of Mount Isa to simply leave. The population of Mount Isa has dropped from 30,000 to 20,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whether it is in the field of mining, which used to whip along at about six per cent growth per year and has now dropped down to about 0.6 per cent growth per year&mdash;most certainly under one per cent&mdash;or whether it is in the field of agriculture, which is down from about three per cent annual growth to about 0.2 per cent annual growth over the last four years, you can see that people are moving out. In real terms, these industries are declining.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last time I looked, I found that 93 per cent of the nation's entire export earnings comes from these industries. But if you remove the services from these areas you will deal body blows to these industries. I could stand here all day and argue, if you want to go into true economic rationalism. If we really were fair dinkum about figuring out what was paying for itself and what was not, we would close down Sydney and move the population out to the Mount Isas, the Longreaches and the Hughendens. If you were being fair dinkum about economic rationalism obviously the only places where this country is internationally competitive is in those fields. Our export earnings indicate quite clearly that 93 per cent of our income comes from those areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come here today with a great deal of bitterness. When I land in Mount Isa I know that&mdash;like all of my fellow citizens in an area where my own family have lived for over 100 years&mdash;we live in very great jeopardy. My grandaddy was one of the original 26 investors in Qantas. The reason they invested in Qantas was&mdash;and here I want to refer to Reverend Flynn who founded the Royal Flying Doctor Service&mdash;to bring a mantle of safety to the outback. Again, my grandaddy helped the Royal Flying Doctor Service greatly and was a great admirer of Dr Flynn. Every day that goes by the economic rationalists are removing that mantle of safety.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After a discussion about one vote, one value, and native title and fringe benefits tax, we might profit from some discussion of the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill, which is before the House.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the opposition spokesman, the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) indicated, he is not opposing the bill, but he has moved an amendment arising from our concerns about the nature of those who should be on the board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority.

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UK6">Mr KELVIN THOMSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to consider the issues of civil aviation safety firstly from the point of view of the recent inquiry into civil aviation safety, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Plane safe</EMPHASIS> , produced by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure as recently as December of last year. That was an inquiry into aviation safety in the commuter and general aviation sectors. Then I want to look at this subject from the point of view of a member of parliament responsible for the safety of constituents adjacent to an airport, the Essendon airport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we look at the inquiry into aviation safety, we can see that the report has discussed the concept of affordable safety. The committee has expressed some concerns about that concept which I would endorse. My own view is that it is a very dangerous concept because it is a euphemism for market forces and deregulation which, in an area of safety standards, simply will not work. The committee at paragraph 2.50 suggested that the concept of affordable safety which was popularised by Dick Smith had within it the concept of accountability to the aviation industry and that that approach could indeed be an explanation for some of the shortcomings of the then Civil Aviation Authority in the performance of its duties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It went on further to say that the Civil Aviation Authority was never captured by the aviation industry; on the contrary, the regulator offered itself as a willing captive. It went on to note submissions it had received that safety standards may well have been reduced. Arising out of this concept of affordable safety, you had Alan Terrell giving the opinion that safety standards had been reduced as a result of deregulation, devolution and delegation to industry commercialisation. He expressed the view that the safety position in general aviation may already be below an acceptable level if the insurance statistics showing a 40 per cent increase in general aviation claims between the early 1990s and the late 1980s could be translated into operational events.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You had the submission from the Australian Licensed Aircraft Engineers Association indicating that, in their view, safety standards had fallen disastrously. The committee went on to disregard the evidence given by Dick Smith because they pointed out that he had included balloon fatalities and excluded crew fatalities, which seemed quite extraordinary. They went on to conclude that there was some hard evidence of a decline in safety in the area of charter operations, although they said there was no hard evidence to show a deterioration of safety in other sectors of general aviation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They also made some points about the possibility of competition within the industry leading to lower safety standards. In chapter 5 they referred to destructive competition. The Industry Commission noted that greater competition might provide an incentive for some operators not to fully comply with safety requirements and that there may be a case for strengthening enforcement procedures. The committee concluded that some preconditions existed for avoiding essential maintenance which endangered safety. They proposed a couple of steps to try and address what they described as destructive competition: the publication of serious deficiency reports and special surveillance of charter operators concerning their business background, aircrew skills and aircraft conditions.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2949">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Chapter 7 of this inquiry into aviation safety dealt with the issue of bogus parts. A senior airworthiness inspector with the Civil Aviation Authority indicated to the committee that the use of bogus parts was entrenched and a well&hyphen;known feature of the industry, and that the Bureau of Air Safety Investigations had data that in the last 10 years there had been three cases where bogus parts were clearly a factor in aviation incidents. There was some concern expressed within the committee on the issue of bogus parts. The committee also expressed a view about emergency locater transmitters and said that those transmitters might be phased in. Since charter operators carry more people than other areas of general aviation, the committee therefore said that emergency locater transmitters perhaps could be installed in these aircraft first because the benefits of installing them were likely to be larger.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have that background of concern about aviation safety being expressed by the House of Representatives standing committee. It is also the case for people in the electorate that I represent, the electorate of Wills, that there is considerable concern about the aviation safety standards applying at Essendon Airport. Most recently, we have had a report released on the December 1993 crash of a 1948 Dove aircraft, from the Essendon Airport, into five houses in Gilbertson Street, Essendon. My concern is that this long&hyphen;awaited report has failed to pursue recommendations which would guarantee that such a crash would not recur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report identifies the failure of the Dove's right engine, caused by failure of that engine's fuel control unit pumps, as the key cause of the crash. But its interim recommendation that all such fuel control unit pumps be inspected was rejected by the Civil Aviation Authority. The bureau meekly accepted this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would say that the Civil Aviation Authority's justifications for rejecting that recommendation were simply not good enough. They said, in the first place, that the cause of the fuel pump failure had not been adequately determined. That, in my view, is all the more reason for checking pumps in other planes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Their second justification for not implementing this recommendation was the `operational and financial burden on Australian DH&hyphen;104 operators'. In my view, that surely must not be allowed to override the safety of aircraft travellers and those who live near airports. It is an expression of that concept of `affordable safety' which I referred to earlier and which I think is absolutely unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing the report does is identify the failure of the landing gear to retract when the pilot first selected it as a key reason that the plane was unable to fly with its remaining engine. It was a twin&hyphen;engine plane, so one engine failed and it was not able to fly with the other engine because the landing gear did not retract first time around. The report went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">periodic checking of the adjustment of the landing gear selection system is therefore a critical practice that was not addressed in the systems of scheduled maintenance.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation made no recommendation for landing gear maintenance to include this check. You would expect that a crash of this seriousness would at least lead to changes designed to prevent a recurrence. But, instead of receiving recommendations to address these problems, residents living around Essendon Airport are told that they are going to have to live with a lower safety standard than applies at, for example, Tullamarine. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">if light aircraft are to be operated in a realistic manner, a level of safety lower than that present in large aircraft must be tolerated. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2950">  </PARA>
<PARA>It also says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During takeoff there is an accepted risk period within which, should an engine failure occur, an accident might result.</PARA>
<PARA>That period is up to 25 seconds. If that is the case, clearly the area of Essendon, which is completely surrounded by housing, is hardly the place for these risks. My view is that the situation is particularly serious concerning charter aircraft, because, as the report indicates:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No guarantees are provided regarding their ability to fly with one engine inoperative. The Certificate of Airworthiness simply doesn't require it.</PARA>
<PARA>If that is to continue to be the case, we should certainly not have charter flights operating out of Essendon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On that count I, and the electorate that I represent, express considerable concern about safety standards. I express some concern because the minister&mdash;who, as a shadow minister, had a lot to say about aviation safety, much of which was of interest to me, representing the electorate that I do&mdash;has a mandate to improve safety standards, not a mandate to allow safety standards to slip.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would raise some concern at the decision that the minister took, going back a couple of weeks, to override the Civil Aviation Safety Authority on the emergency locater transmitter issue. This was only a first issue and a first step, I guess. Nevertheless, it is not a happy precedent that the minister has chosen to ignore the view of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and to impose his own position on that issue. I express some concern about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that the minister made a lot out of safety issues when he was in opposition, with the Monarch crash and so on. These are important issues, and I used to share some of his concerns, because it was certainly my view that the Federal Airports Corporation and the management at Essendon Airport had always had a `she'll be right, mate' attitude and were forever playing down issues of aviation safety, and that they were not up&hyphen;front with me. I remember that, when the de Havilland Dove crashed in December 1993, I and everyone else who visited the site on that night thought, `That's it, then. The airport will surely close now; but look at the terrible cost in terms of the damage that it has done.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I and others were amazed when the aviation authorities commenced glossing over this incident. And this is still happening. We had the owner&hyphen;operator and pilot of that plane, Mr Rudge, writing to a local paper and saying that the inquiry showed that he was not to blame. I just wonder what he thinks happened: that the plane fell out of the sky by itself? We had a school of criminologists in the 1970s who used to say that society was to blame. So you may wonder whether Mr Rudge thinks that society is to blame for the crash.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even as recently as Saturday 15 June, just a week and a bit ago, we had eyewitness accounts of another near miss at Essendon Airport. Once again, the aviation authority was saying, `Oh, this wasn't too bad.' The spokeswoman for Airservices Australia was reported as saying that a Beechcraft Skipper was flying south on its final approach to runway 17 when a Piper Cherokee approached from the east. The Cherokee pilot had been instructed by the control tower to follow the Skipper. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was a student pilot in the Cherokee who turned on to the base leg without allowing enough distance to follow the Skipper. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2951">  </PARA>
<PARA>The Skipper then had to make a go&hyphen;around and he would have pulled out of the situation to allow the aircraft that was supposed to let him in to land first.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to eye witnesses, it was quite a serious incident, which occurred directly above de Havilland Avenue in Strathmore. It is most unsatisfactory from the point of view of local residents to have the procession of accidents and incidents that we have had at Essendon Airport and to have, once again, this being fobbed off by aviation authorities. We even have the situation where there is a fresh proposal for pilot training at Essendon Airport, with a proposal to establish a pilot training scheme for overseas pilots. Yet the near miss which occurred just a week and a half ago arose in relation to a trainee pilot, and it certainly heightens the case against the pilot school being established there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, the mandate of the transport minister is to improve air safety in this country. It will not happen by kowtowing to the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association. It will not happen by going with the concept of affordable safety, which is a pseudonym for market forces and the absence of the necessary regulation of safety standards. It will not happen by appointing, for example, Dick Smith to the board. These sorts of things would greatly concern both the opposition and people in my electorate.</PARA>

Given the current fiscal crisis facing the Government, this undertaking is now even more important. The Government is currently conducting a review of the LGDP, its future priorities and expenditure levels within a framework that maximises Local Government's contribution to the nation's overall economic and social performance.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Specific instances since 1972, of track improvements or installation in the Greater Western Sydney area, which have been assisted by Commonwealth funds include the electrification of the Richmond to Riverstone line; construction of the line linking the Parramatta and Liverpool lines, known as the `Parramatta Y'; construction of the Macarthur turnback and loop; and construction of the Ingleburn/Glenfield crossing loop.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The only active NSW State Government request for funding is for the acquisition of land for a rail corridor which would provide for the future development of a rail link to Sydney West Airport. The previous Government offered New South Wales $17 million for this purpose, subject to certain conditions. With the Federal Government's recent decision to broaden the Environmental Impact Statement(EIS) process, further consideration of this issue is dependent upon the outcome of the EIS. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA></ANSWER></ANSWER.TO.QON>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The allocation of new nursing home and hostel places and community aged care packages in particular geographical areas is based on target planning ratios. These ratios are 40 nursing home places, 50 hostel places and 10 community aged care packages per thousand of population aged 70 and over. Within this framework, Aged Care Advisory Committees advise the Minister on regional allocations, taking into account factors like the existing provision of places, the target provision of places in relation to the ratios, the pressure on existing facilities, and the presence of other types of care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The process is based on regions, and within regions the needs of Statistical Local Areas are considered. In New South Wales the regions are the Commonwealth Department of Health and Family Services planning regions, which are determined to reflect broad communities of interest and are, as far as possible, consistent with our major funding partners, for example State health and community services departments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Yes.</PARA>
