<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That this House records its deep sadness at the death, on 8 January 1996, of Francois Mitterrand, the former President of France, and expresses its deep sympathy to his widow, Mrs Danielle Mitterrand, to the Mitterrand family and to the people of France in their bereavement, and requests that this motion be conveyed by the Speaker on behalf of the House to the Government of France.</PARA>
<PARA>I move this motion on behalf of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), who, along with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), is today attending the special Tasmanian memorial service in Hobart. Francois Mitterrand was a distinguished statesman and visionary leader. As President for 14 years, he stands alongside President de Gaulle as a key figure in the history of modern France. Mr Mitterrand's death, after a long illness which he bore with dignity and fortitude, was a profound loss for France, Europe and the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Francois Mitterrand once described politics as the art of judo&mdash;the art of nimbleness and the ability to surprise your opponent. In a political career which spanned almost 50 years, Mr Mitterrand proved himself a very skilled exponent of the art of politics as he defined it. He also brought to his political life the intellectual breadth and deep learning, enormous energy and sheer tenacity which made him not just a political survivor throughout those fifty years but a towering and influential figure in shaping the destiny of postwar France.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Elected to the French National Assembly in 1946, Mr Mitterrand soon after became, at the age of 30, a minister in President de Gaulle's first postwar government. He served in successive governments until 1958, when he broke with President de Gaulle. The next two <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> decades were dominated by his rebuilding and leadership of the Socialist Party, which provided the platform for his third and successful bid for the presidency in 1981. His easy victory of a second term in 1988 was a tribute both to his popularity and to his authoritative dominance of the French political scene. Having gone the rounds with such people as the famous French Foreign Minister Couvre de Meville, de Gaulle and others, he was subsequently elected twice as President of France.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As is inevitably the case with such a long period in office, there are many different views and judgments about the achievements of Mr Mitterrand's two terms as President. But there is no doubt or disagreement about either the strength of his reforming zeal and of his commitment to social justice, or his pragmatic appreciation of economic realities as when, in 1983, he recognised the need to put aside his dream of `socialism in one country' and implemented an economic reform program based on fiscal restraint.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also no doubt that Francois Mitterrand was one of the chief architects of European unity and that this will be his most significant and enduring legacy. Mr Mitterrand was first and foremost a Frenchman, with a passionate pride in, and commitment to, his country. But he had the vision to realise that the best guarantee for France's future rested not in the pursuit of a narrow nationalism, but in securing a leading role for France in bringing about a united and peaceful European community. To achieve this goal, he worked with passionate conviction and unrelenting determination to build a partnership between France and Germany, a country against which he had fought in his youth. His clasping of hands with German Chancellor Kohl in a cemetery at Verdun in 1983 symbolised not only the friendship of the two leaders, but also the new era of peaceful and effective cooperation between their two nations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the goal of European unity was his major preoccupation, Mr Mitterrand also exercised active and constructive leadership to ensure a wider international role for France. He often took a direct and personal <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> interest, as when he flew to Sarajevo in 1992 to draw attention to the plight of Bosnia. He was a catalyst in achieving closer cooperation between Europe and the United States. Under his leadership, France played a leading role in seeking resolutions to the problems in Cambodia and the Middle East. He committed French troops to the Gulf War, and to peacekeeping operations in Rwanda, Bosnia and Somalia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Mitterrand also displayed far&hyphen;sighted leadership in redefining France's role in the South Pacific. Under his presidency, France's enlightened policy of reconciliation with the indigenous peoples of France's overseas territories, especially through the Matignon Accords in New Caledonia, was a valuable initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For Australians, Francois Mitterrand will be remembered most warmly for his declaration in 1992 of a moratorium on French nuclear testing. His decision was much appreciated, especially in the South Pacific, and was a positive contribution towards the goal of nuclear non&hyphen;proliferation. I am sure that Mr Mitterrand would have welcomed the recent signature by France of the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty, and its commitment to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, when negotiated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Mitterrand was an outstanding politician and impressive individual. His many achievements have left a deep and lasting legacy, which will shape not only the future of France but also of Europe. I am sure that all members of this House join with me and the Prime Minister in expressing our deep condolences to Mr Mitterrand's family and the people of France. I commend this motion to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to be able to associate the opposition with this motion of condolence, and to do so personally as someone who both met late President Mitterrand on several occasions and was privileged to attend his state requiem mass in January as Australia's representative. For 50 of his 79 years, Francois Mitterrand was absolutely at centre stage of French politics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="76">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the last 14 years he was the longest serving and only socialist President of the Fifth Republic and he will be remembered by the French people for many things&mdash;firstly, for the extraordinary political perseverance of a man who first entered government in 1944, was a minister 11 times between 1946 and 1957, and spent some years in the wilderness&mdash;twice running unsuccessfully for the presidency before finally entering the Elysee as President.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He will be remembered as the man who forged the socialists into a united and effective party in the 1970s and 1980s&mdash;moving the party away from the large accumulation of Marxist dogma it then had toward the centre. He will be remembered for a flourishing period of domestic reform in the 1980s in human rights and social policy in particular&mdash;including the abolition of the death penalty, the protection of coloured immigrants in France, the curbing of police powers, the modernising of labour laws and the doubling of the national budget devoted to the arts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He will be remembered also by French people particularly for his extraordinary complexity&mdash;and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) has already commented on that&mdash;as the Vichy participant who became the Resistance leader; the very formal and reserved man, as I can personally testify, who was nonetheless a superb public orator; and the way in which he unpredictably changed political course from conservatism to socialism to, at the end, what could probably only be described as something in the middle. The Deputy Prime Minister referred to a judo characterisation, which is very apt. I always think of that famous quote of his: `My strategy is to have only tactics.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He will be remembered for the way in which he blew hot and cold on so many issues, which led Regis Debray to say on one famous occasion that at least that kept the lukewarm people away. They are the ways in which he will be remembered by the French, but of course he will also be remembered by the people of Europe as a whole as one of the prime architects of European union, holding closely, even in the sceptical 1990s, to his <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> policy vision of an integrated Europe based on close Franco&hyphen;German entente.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He will also be remembered not only by the people of France and Europe but also by the people of the world in particular for two great legacies, the first of them being his cultural legacy&mdash;the series of massive building projects that changed the face, in ways that have only enhanced it, of unquestionably one of the world's loveliest cities, Paris. This included the reconstruction of the Louvre with I.M. Pei's glass pyramid as the centrepiece, the great modernistic arch at La Defence, the new Bastille Opera House and the new national library project. All are a magnificent testimony to his cultural vision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He will be remembered by the whole world for his contribution to a saner nuclear world. There were as always some twists and turns along the way. It has to be acknowledged that he opposed de Gaulle originally in the development of France's independent nuclear program then became one of that programs staunchest defenders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But then came his momentous decision in 1992 to impose a moratorium on French nuclear tests in the South Pacific&mdash;a decision which was absolutely crucial in developing the momentum that we are now seeing for a nuclear non&hyphen;proliferation treaty consolidated and made indefinite in its scope and for a comprehensive test plan treaty which we all hope will be negotiated to its conclusion this year. Hopefully, ultimately, it will be the forerunner for the achievement of the complete elimination of nuclear weapons to which we are all in this House committed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Francois Mitterrand's life left an extraordinary legacy for France, for Europe and for the whole world. It is entirely appropriate and fitting under those circumstances that we in this Australian parliament should mark his passing with this respectful motion of condolence.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(9.42 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to associate myself with this condolence motion for former President Francois Mitterrand. As others have said before me, Francois Mitterrand was the longest serving French President, at least of the Fifth Republic, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="77"> having served as the President for 14 years. He developed a reputation not just during his time as the President of France but throughout his adult life as being the consummate political pragmatist.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) used the well known quote that Mr Mitterand's strategy was only to have tactics. Certainly if one reads the various biographies of Francois Mitterrand, whilst there may be a lot of confection in much of the work written about him in recent years, the theme of pragmatism is something that emerges through those works. He was a socialist president. When his government first came to office in the early 1980s it pursued social democratic, centre left policies and by the time he left office it had moved in the opposite direction&mdash;I suppose to be fair, in line with the general move in the intellectual debate around the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He made a great contribution to European security and European peace through developing the relationship between France and Germany and always understood that the embrace between France and Germany was fundamental to the stability of Western Europe. He, along with Chancellor Helmut Kohl, was instrumental in designing and finally achieving the Treaty of Maastricht on European union in 1991. He also had a broader world vision as French presidents frequently do. He had a world vision for France, but a constructive vision for the national community. He involved France in the Gulf War coalition in a very constructive way and he committed French forces to peacekeeping operations in Rwanda, Bosnia and Somalia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under Mitterrand's presidency, France's bilateral relationship with Australia evolved in a very constructive way. There was, for example, the resolution, albeit for a limited period, of the difficult issue of New Caledonia through the signing of the Matignon Accords. As others have said, it was President Mitterrand, I believe in the face of pressure of local government elections or whatever, who imposed a moratorium on French nuclear testing in the South Pacific.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">France's agreement to limited reforms to the common agricultural policy of the European Union and to the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of the GATT was also an initiative of President Mitterrand's and, obviously, was also welcomed by our farmers who had suffered and who, let me say, continue to suffer under the weight of the common agricultural policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia and France under the Mitterand presidency collaborated successfully in a number of multilateral spheres, notably on Antarctica in which we both pursued successful joint diplomatic initiatives to protect the environment and to prohibit mining activity, and disarmament where there was close collaboration between Australia and France on the chemical weapons convention and a range of other similar issues. On Cambodia, as the  Deputy Leader of the Opposition would know better than I would, I understand we maintained a close dialogue with France during that period. There has also been a good record of cooperation in the South Pacific in areas such as development assistance, disaster relief, fisheries, surveillance and extensive defence contacts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So during the Mitterrand presidency the relationship between Australia and France developed very constructively. He was, therefore, from Australia's point of view an important president but, above all, he was a very significant figure in the history of modern France and one of the most significant of presidents in the life of the Fifth Republic. Mr Speaker, I extend my sympathy to President Mitterrand's widow, Danielle and also, on his passing, to the people of France.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(9.47 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I congratulate you on your appointment to your very high office. I also wish to add a few words to the condolence motion for President Mitterrand. I was very excited when Mitterrand achieved his goal of leading the socialist forces to power in France in 1981. In so many ways he became a symbol of the possibilities of what might be called the democratic socialist approach that later developed and flourished throughout Europe. Although it is true that Mitterrand began with a more conservative <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="78"> approach, there is no doubt that he became very committed to the idea that you could have a left&hyphen;wing party which was committed to both the ideals of democracy and an egalitarian society. He saw that model as distinctively different from the Soviet system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Throughout his life both in domestic politics in France and in foreign policy throughout France's relations with the Soviet Union, he took a very tough attitude towards Soviet communism. So here you had a president who was from the left and who believed very much in the ideals of democratic socialism but who had no illusions whatever about the totalitarian system of the Soviet Union and who therefore, generally speaking, supported the broader democratic forces throughout the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interestingly, looking at Mitterrand's period in office, during the reign of his governments all of the difficulties, problems, contradictions and issues which social democratic parties faced were faced by his governments&mdash;and he faced them very squarely. Initially, he began with a socialisation program of nationalisation of enterprises as a way of ensuring significant control of the French economy. But he found that this process was not very successful, given that he also wanted links with the rest of Europe in a tight European Union. So, as a consequence of that, Mitterrand eventually abandoned that program and moved to a more centre&hyphen;left program which allowed him to build bridges with the other nations of Europe and to strengthen the European Union.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) said, his most enduring achievement was in his dream that France would be at the centre of a greater European Union. He was very much in favour of expanding the European Union and yet making the Union more meaningful. He very much supported the development of the European Parliament. Interestingly, for some time now the biggest grouping in the European Parliament has been the democratic socialists, with whom he had considerable links.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So Mitterrand leaves a legacy of a man who believed very much in basic democratic socialist ideals and egalitarianism and who, nevertheless, was flexible in seeing that in the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> modern world different policies may be required at different times to achieve those goals. He certainly looked for those goals, but whether you can say that he finally achieved them, only history will tell. There is no doubt that throughout all of the governments that he was involved with, Mitterrand was always trying to find solutions for the betterment of the people of France and, in particular, to achieve greater equality and justice within France itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much has been said of his commitment to disarmament and to stopping French testing in the South Pacific. For us in Australia that was further confirmation of the basic decency of Mitterrand and his concern to have good relations with this part of the world. We can all look to the Mitterrand era as one in which the relations between Australia and France were very good.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He, interestingly, very much loved and was committed to French culture. Nevertheless, he was an internationalist. He believed in important relations with the rest of Europe, with bringing together all the nations and cultures of Europe and, in that sense, he also appreciated others' cultures and others' points of view. I think Mitterrand was one of the important leaders of this century and we all mourn his passing.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join with the other speakers today. As the member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) indicated, Mitterrand's victory in 1981 was probably as interesting to my generation and the progressive wing of politics as a Thatcherite victory in Britain. As earlier speakers have remarked, he was a very complex person, a man who, in 1935, led demonstrations against foreign workers but, with his victory in the 1980s, increased their rights in France. In the Fourth Republic, when he was variously minister for veterans' affairs, overseas territories and the interior, Mitterrand was responsible for the first liberalisation of rights in colonial Africa but, at the same time, condoned the torture of FLN fighters in Algeria. That lead&hyphen;up to 1981, after the rise in 1968, and his ability to re&hyphen;establish the strength of the Socialist Party was, indeed, deeply inspiring to many of us. Only yesterday my father <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="79"> remarked on the huge emotion in Paris when he arrived there on 10 May 1981 as Deputy Premier of New South Wales and on the exuberance of the French population at that change of the French political scape.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To my mind, Mitterrand was most crucial, as some speakers have alluded to, in the actual transformation of French Left politics. From the 1920s, the Left in France had been largely dominated by the pro&hyphen;Stalinist Communist Party and their control of the major trade union federation, the CGT. Mitterrand had to walk a very narrow tightrope in essentially forming a socialist party that had credibility after its rather unfortunate history during the Fourth Republic. He was a man who had sacrificed himself by being one of the few on the left to strongly oppose the basic coup by de Gaulle and was to lose his seat as a result of that. He went into the wilderness and then, in 1971, became the first secretary of a party he had not previously been a member of, from a very small base.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the one hand, he had to increase the strength of the Socialist Party and, on the other, he had to try to bring the Communist Party into an electoral alliance. He succeeded in doing that by the joint program and, in that process, marginalised the French Communist Party as a force in France. Of course, the collapse of the Soviet Union and later events were to strengthen that trend, but that was his essential accomplishment&mdash;he made the French Socialist Party the major party of the Left.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The period from 1981 did have a lot of very essential social reforms: the abolition of the death penalty; the abolition of the rather draconian security court; and people have referred to the increase in the arts expenditure. Modern Paris has been transformed by many of the edifices that he was responsible for. One thing that has been left out and is crucial, and very contemporary in this country, is the question of centralisation of power. He essentially&mdash;very crucially&mdash;got rid of the authoritarian centralised Bonapartist leftovers. He abolished the prefecture system to a large degree&mdash;undermined it&mdash;and established local and regional government. Even in Australia <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> at this time we debate the process of eliminating municipal power and centralising controls.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I join with others and finally refer to a fairly novel and independent foreign policy, on the one hand supporting Pershing missiles, being part of NATO, being fairly anti&hyphen;Soviet but, on the other hand, being one of the first people to welcome Gorbachev into the international community, supporting the Third World, taking an independent line in regard to the US embargo on Cuba and, of course, supporting liberation movements in El Salvador and Nicaragua.</PARA>

<PARA>Mr Speaker, I move this motion and further motions today against a backdrop where the coalition has been concerned for many years about declining standards in the Australian parliament. There is no question that there has been a lot of public concern about standards in the parliament and that has expressed itself in many ways. Accordingly, in the recent election campaign, the government flagged its intentions to introduce a series of measures by which we believe standards can be raised. It is also our view that, in addition to sensible procedural changes, the standards in parliament can be raised simply by a change of approach and attitude by the government of the day emanating from the Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) made his views on this very clear when he addressed the House for the first time on the question of your election as Speaker. Today we follow up those first remarks by the Prime Minister in a more detailed way to put additional substance to the government's intentions in this regard. In doing so, let me also by way of preliminary remarks say that there can be no doubt about the backdrop by which we introduce these amendments. Let me remind people that it was a sad fact under the previous government that standards fell as low as they did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous Prime Minister, for example, said&mdash;I was in the chamber when he said it&mdash;that question time was a privilege extended by the executive to the parliament. That really was an incredible statement to make. In fact, it is a denial of one of the basic precepts of our democratic institution. These people, on the other side now, acquiesced in that. Until it is repudiated, I would have to say that it still represents their view. The same person, with the acquiescence of those opposite, once <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> described the Senate as swill. That, again, is a basic denial of the rights of people to be represented in the Senate&mdash;and the Senate is one of the great creations of the Australian federal parliament, providing a wide diversity of views and giving people, particularly those in outer areas, an opportunity to be heard and to thereby fully participate in the democratic process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are three motions to be put before the chair. Let me put them in context so that the first motion is properly rounded out. The first motion relates to a series of changes to the standing orders. I will come to each and every aspect of those in a moment. The second refers to the broadcast rules, another of the Keating legacies which I will say more about in due course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third motion which I will present to the House relates to arrangements for next Monday. As the parliament resumes we need to make some minor procedural changes for when the House gets into full swing. I foreshadow a further motion to deal with arrangements for the later part of today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The motion now before the chair, and which is detailed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>, covers a wide range of matters. Can I just start by referring to comments by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) yesterday in congratulating the Speaker on his election. The Leader of the Opposition said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Generally speaking, we chose when we were changing standing orders to refer those to the Procedure Committee. So we will be providing an opportunity tomorrow, when the standing orders get placed, for a gesture from the parliament as to whether there will be an assertion of the parliament over the executive by a reference of those standing order changes to the Procedure Committee.</PARA>
<PARA>You could have knocked me over with a feather! As I will demonstrate, virtually all of the proposals we have for the parliament today come from the Procedure Committee. It shows the incredible ignorance of these people opposite or, if that is too generous, the incredible arrogance of these people who have rejected and failed to take into account the recommendations of the Procedure Committee. Rather than you putting it to us that we should put it to the Procedure Committee, you ought to have the decency to acknowledge <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="85"> that these matters have come from the Procedure Committee&mdash;and you never had sufficient respect for the Procedure Committee to take up its earlier recommendations.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="CREAN" NAMEID="DT4">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr Crean</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So did the finishing time recommendation.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me come to that matter first because I am happy to come to some of the timing questions. The motions being put before the chair include various changes to the sitting times of the parliament. Members will notice that we are proposing to bring question time back from 3 o'clock to 2 o'clock and that there will be no rostering of ministers for question time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unlike in the last parliament when we had this incredible and ridiculous system of rostering, under the Howard government all ministers, including the Prime Minister, will attend question time every day and be available to answer questions. It was a feature of the Keating administration that the rostered day off for ministers was introduced. We do not accept the rostered day off system&mdash;we never did. It is a denial of one of the essential traits of this place, that ministers must be accountable to the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that the roster system removed an element of accountability in the proceedings of the House. As those who have been here for a number of years will know, when you have a minister on the run, part of having that minister accountable is the fact that they know the pressure is building on them. In a rostered day off situation, they know that if they can get through today, they have tomorrow off and they can sit in their offices, have a cup of tea and watch the proceedings on the monitor. You are making their lives easier than it is in the public interest for them to be. In making this change we make a significant change to the operation of the chamber and thereby enhance accountability of the executive to the parliament. So do not give me the message about accountability when you talk about the Procedure Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> In respect of the change to question time timing, that is another of the Keating traits. It was a barely disguised ruse to take question time off the live broadcast. We have broad casts of the parliament as a result of the initiative of the Senate, where we pursued the matter and required the broadcasting of that chamber. The former Prime Minister and the former Leader of the House, the now Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, were totally opposed to broadcasting the proceedings of this parliament. They did not want people to see the way they treated the parliament. They wanted to censor the proceedings of this parliament because there was such an adverse reaction from the public to the lowering of the standards under the previous administration. That was the fact of the matter. So we required the television broadcasting of the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did the previous government&mdash;Mr Beazley and others&mdash;do? They changed the sitting time for question time, knowing that the ABC would then not broadcast live question time in the House of Representatives, knowing that the ABC would prefer to run <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sesame Street</EMPHASIS>. You hid behind <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sesame Street</EMPHASIS> to deny the Australian people the opportunity to see their representatives accounting in the parliament of the day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those opposite refer to the Procedure Committee. Its advice on this matter was that question time should be no later than 2.30. So on this very first matter you acted against the recommendation of the Procedure Committee as part of your political device to deny people the opportunity to see a live broadcast of question time. So we are bringing back question time to 2 o'clock. I think that in itself will be a very useful measure to buttress our reforms to enhance accountability in the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly in respect of the sitting hours, the motion before the House proposes longer sitting hours to enable responsibilities to be carried out fully and properly.</PARA>

Contrary to the impression that I suspect the shadow minister will be putting up, the fact is that this matter of sitting hours has been back and forward to the Procedure Committee over many years. In 1986, for example, they at that time decided not to make any changes. In 1993 they decided to make some changes to introduce the sort of system that operated under the previous government. Then in 1995 they reviewed the matter further. They decided to stick with the existing system, but in fact they did take the views of a number of our colleagues and of those views expressed by colleagues there were apparently&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you very much. That is my point. There were 12 submissions and of those submissions six were basically in favour and six wanted to make some changes. The changes that they were proposing were to have a later sitting pattern and to have a properly defined meal break, which does provide people with the opportunity to enjoy a meal in the parliament and of course to see people in what is otherwise a very busy schedule for most members.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rather than being oblivious to the matters raised by the Procedure Committee, we have properly taken those into account. We think this is a fair balance. A few years ago we sat late every night. Now we have what I think is a fair combination. We finish early on Wednesday nights so that people can get out. On Thursday nights we finish early so people can catch their flights. As people are here on Monday and Tuesday nights, the parliament will sit. That will certainly enhance the opportunities for all members of the parliament to speak in the parliament and to put the views of their constituencies. We think we have reached a sensible balance, and we are therefore proceeding with that proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The motion also implements some other key recommendations put by the Procedure Committee. The government will bring back the practice of having second reading speeches at <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the time bills are introduced so that members will have available to them a comprehensive package of information&mdash;the bill, the explanatory memorandum and the minister's second reading speech&mdash;to assist their understanding and appreciation of the legislation. This, in our view, is essential to ensure that this House is able to have the most informed debate possible. I think the shadow minister is nodding.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="CREAN" NAMEID="DT4">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr Crean</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with that.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, it is a pity you did not implement it. I am happy to note his support for that. We are proceeding with that measure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further measure is that the House intends to return to the previous informal arrangements for agreeing to cognate debates by way of a suggestion being put from the chair immediately before the first resumption of debate on the second reading, thereby returning to a previous convention and arrangement that worked well in the past. We are now reintroducing it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recognising the importance of the grievance debate to private members, a set period of 80 minutes for grievance debate will be provided on each sitting Monday so that there is certainty for members who wish to raise issues of importance to their constituents. Whilst I understand that the opposition was prepared to support a set period of only one hour in its response to the Procedure Committee report, I am hopeful that they will see the merit in this extended period. In other words, they were going to give only an hour; we are giving more. It is a set period. For those who are new to this place, the grievance debate is particularly important because it gives you an extended period within which to make a contribution.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="CREAN" NAMEID="DT4">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr Crean</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Ten minutes more.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, but it is a set period, which you were not prepared to give. It is a guarantee. We think guaranteeing members their rights is important. I say to all new members that the grievance debate is a very important opportunity for you if you have a big issue and you want to make a substantial contribution. The grievance debate has a particular precedence and authority within the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="87"> chamber, and I think this is a very good measure for all concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further measure proposes to standardise the speech time limit for consideration of amendments to legislation, regardless of whether they are amendments made or requested by the Senate or amendments moved in this House. The speech time limit will be the same; that is, an unlimited number of five-minute periods for each member on each question before the chair. I hope the opposition might support this reform as well. It is another one of the recommendations from the Procedure Committee, and I think it is a very sensible one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to questions on notice, members will be able to request the Speaker to follow up with ministers if answers are not provided within 60 days instead of 90 days, as in the last parliament. This is an important measure in the context of promoting open government. Again, we look forward to opposition support along the line of its response to the Procedure Committee report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two additional matters, largely procedural, which were not the subject of the Procedure Committee reports&mdash;and I will make the reason for that clear. We intend to restore as permanent standing orders old sessional orders 150, which deals with questions to the Speaker at the end of question time, and 322, which deals with the single motion to take note of papers. So we are picking up some sessional orders and putting them into the standing orders. I am sure that will have the support of all members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last measure is that the motion seeks to give explicit and formal authority for the publication of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> similar to that provided by the standing orders for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Votes and Proceedings</EMPHASIS>. This will ensure that all matters in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>, including questions on notice, whether in printed or electronic form, are covered by parliamentary privilege.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similar action has been taken in the Senate following a recommendation from the Senate Procedure Committee. Again, we think that is sensible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a few other purely consequential and machinery amendments in the motion. I believe this is a good balance. It does give <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> proper prominence to the rights and opportunities for private members. We believe the sitting times are very reasonable, taking into account the views of the people as expressed over a substantial period and taking into account the views of the procedures committees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that we are now redressing in the standing orders a series of the Keating measures, all of which effectively downgraded the significance of parliament. They certainly were tainted politically to provide the government of the day with an advantage and to reduce accountability. It will be set in the memory of the Australian people that the previous Labor administration cared little for parliamentary forms and processes and denied people their basic rights by the way in which they denigrated parliamentary processes. We today, on the first formal day of business of this parliament, start the long business of restoring the parliament to its proper place in the Australian democracy.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, I say at the outset that the opposition does commit itself to assisting the Speaker and you in the orderly operation of the House. I want to take up the point which the Leader of the House, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), finished on, and that is restoring the proper running of the parliament to some sort of order. That of course is a two-way street. If there is to be the cooperation of the opposition, there has to be the involvement of the opposition in procedures that come before it. Just as there was no discussion with the opposition on the election of the Speaker and the issues surrounding the so-called independence of the new Speaker, so was there no discussion with us about these proceedings which we are debating today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will go further and remind the House that on numerous occasions we had complaints from what was then the opposition of not being given adequate notice of government business; yet the issues that we are debating today in relation to the first notice of motion on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> were tabled late in the day yesterday, and we did not see items 2 and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="88"> 3 until the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> was released today.

So let us have none of this hypocrisy about the new approach. The government has in fact failed on its first day of business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, we did not see items 2 and 3 until the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> appeared today. I say this at the outset: this is not a very encouraging start. I hope it is not going to continue to be the norm because if it is it is going to make that task of cooperation which we are committed to that much more difficult. I simply want to place that on the record at this stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, the opposition does acknowledge the sense of a number of the government's proposed changes to the standing orders, and in respect of those we will be supporting them. For example, we do accept the amendment that will enable the mover of a bill to proceed to the second reading speech immediately. That makes sense. We also support the requirement for questions on notice to be responded to within 60 days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We recognise that the government has a mandate in relation to the change of the roster, and we also recognise that mandate in the starting of question time in the parliament. But let me make this point on the starting of question time in the parliament coming back to 2 o'clock as distinct from 3 o'clock: we did not introduce the 3 o'clock time to avoid the media. How could you ever do that? We <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> did it because we recognised in government the importance of enabling the Prime Minister and ministers to attend important functions outside of the parliament and still having the opportunity to get back here.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What about the circumstances of today? There is going to be an amendment on the very first day that we are moving back to a 2 o'clock question time start; there is going to be an amendment today to make it 3 o'clock. We all know the circumstances for that, but I think there does have to be an acknowledgment that there are many occasions in which senior ministers and the Prime Minister in this House simply cannot be back by 2 o'clock. Today is one of those examples, but it is not limited to that. So let us not kid ourselves that there was no merit in the 3 o'clock start. We do acknowledge that you campaigned on the basis of the 2 o'clock start and we are not going to oppose it. I simply make this point: let us hear none of this argument that says that we put question time on at 3 o'clock to avoid some form of scrutiny.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other area which we support is the changes to the broadcasting recommendations. As the Leader of the House has indicated, these were recommended by the Standing Committee on Procedure. We are not going to oppose those. However, the opposition does perceive significant difficulties associated with the proposed amendments to standing orders 40, 48A and 103. So we will be moving amendments to those particular aspects. In effect, what these amendments do in the suite of amendments that are before us is to alter the hours of sitting of the House principally by extending the sitting hours to 11 p.m. as distinct from 8 p.m. on Mondays and Tuesdays.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I come to the argument about the Procedure Committee, let us just understand what we are achieving here. The net effect of the government's proposals is that, whilst the House would be required to be around, either in recess or sitting, for an extra 4&half; hours a week, the actual gain in sitting time is only 1&half; hours. That comes about because the changes mean no net gain in sitting hours on <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="89"> Tuesday and only 1&half; hours net gain on Monday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can see your backbench, Leader of the House, looking very pensive about this because they are starting to understand the circumstances in which you are changing arrangements. For a net gain of 1&half; hours, you are requiring the place to sit around for an extra 4&half; hours. That comes about because we are required to be here for the hour and a half dinner break. Those who have experienced it know that it is very difficult to get out of the place and back within that time of an hour and a half. The requirement is essentially to be here for that time but then stay on to 11 o'clock.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of reasons why we oppose this motion. The first item is on the agenda because we receive a lot of lecturing from the other side of the House about fiscal responsibility and cutting expenditure, but the costs associated with this little exercise are going to be very significant indeed. The members of staff and the support staff in the parliament that will have to be kept back to accommodate this arrangement are going to increase the cost of running this facility, this business, this House, significantly. I think it is an extravagance in those circumstances and particularly strange in an environment in which the government is, as I say, lecturing us constantly on the need to tighten up on spending.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second area goes to the impact on one's health. Past experience has shown that late sittings do have a deleterious impact on the health of members' staff. This point was alluded to by the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) when this debate was on previously. She quoted Senator Herron&mdash;as we all know, a medical practitioner&mdash;on people's abilities to function when they are operating in the night-time hours as distinct from the daytime hours. We are not the only ones asserting it. There is an array of medical evidence that suggests it is a far more effective basis for operation to have people working in the daylight hours rather than being expected to continue fully up to date and fully operating late into the night.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third area of opposition is the impact it will have on families. We all know in this place that our families are affected whatever happens, whenever we sit. Whether we sit till 11 o'clock or not, we are away from them for most of the four days we are up here. But what about our support staff? Doesn't this government, which talks about the need for family based policies, have some regard to the impact that families are going to suffer by the fact that people who work here have to stay back for the extra time?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth area I draw your attention to is that when this was debated on a previous occasion it was the media that indicated that they would, as a result of the 8 o'clock change, be prepared to give more consideration and reportage to adjournment debates. I know you have a lot on your backbench. Maybe that has more to do with content, but I would have thought that, with those people on the backbench who want to get into the adjournment debate as a means of getting their points of view up, this is an important consideration for them to take on board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the most compelling reason for our amendments is: why change? The existing system works. It was originally referred to, as the Leader of the House has indicated, a standing committee which set the pattern of sitting hours that we now have. It took into account all the facts and reported on the adverse consequences. Whilst there was a dissenting report to that initial set of recommendations, the opposition committee members' part of that dissenting report did not oppose the change to the late night sittings from 11 o'clock back to 8 o'clock. That was the original report that determined the basis upon which we sit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was then a review, and that was contained in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Time for review: bills, questions and working hours</EMPHASIS> issued in June 1995. In that report, the committee noted that there was general acceptance of the new hours. The committee was reluctant to interfere with the pattern that was working well or to break the regularity of the 8 p.m. rise each day. The committee recommended that no change be made to the hours of sitting of the House. There was no dissenting report put to that. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="90"> This was the opportunity for members to have made their submissions if they were complaining about it, but, as the Leader of the House indicated, only 12 submissions were received and there was essentially no dissent to the view that we should persist with the change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We heard the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) talk yesterday about the supremacy of the parliament over the executive. What we have here today is essentially an executive decision going against what the previous parliament determined. I would say that the sensible thing to do here is that, if the government has a claim for changing the hours, it should go back to the Procedure Committee. It should be referred back to the body that made the original decision, reviewed it and found it to be effective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is for those reasons that the opposition is not prepared to support the proposed motion. We do propose amendments to the government's motion. In essence, these amendments, which have been circulated, do refer the issue of sitting hours to the Procedure Committee&mdash;the body that the Leader of the House so heavily relies on when it suits him to assert his other arguments for change, but not in this case. Secondly, because I do acknowledge the government's right to extend the sitting hours of the House&mdash;and this side of the House does&mdash;in the interim, pending the report of the Procedure Committee, to achieve that extra net 1&half; hours, I believe we should add half an hour each to Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very interesting that the opposition feels it necessary to shorten the sitting times in this place. The reason is quite obvious&mdash;they have not got enough members to make up the speakers lists. In fact, you would be aware, sir, that there is now a question which compares the Labor Party with a Toyota Tarago and asks, `What is the difference?' Of course, it is that the Tarago has more seats.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that there is a huge challenge for this parliament to get some decent legislation through for the purpose of turning around a very damaged economy, to reduce the level of debt and to legislate in all the areas to ensure that Australia can take its place in the world by the turn of the century, so that our young people can maintain the living standards which have been propped up over the last 13 years by the simple process of borrowing money. That is a substantial legislative task. It is the responsibility of this House to allocate the necessary time to debate these matters. I can assure the opposition that if they do not want to participate in the debate there will be plenty of people on this side who will do so and who will make the appropriate contribution. That is why the time is needed&mdash;to do a job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean) would be the first to want shorter working hours. It was all he ever knew when he was in the union movement. All he ever wanted to do was shorten working hours. In the process, as we know, because of his activities and those of some of his mates, on one occasion, because they demanded more pay for less work, 40,000 of their members in the metal trades were sacked. It is something you should admit when you are fighting with one another in your party forums, as I am <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="95"> sure you will, as you continue to analyse the reasons why there are only 40 of you left.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that you do not need the time to debate these matters, but we do. We are going to deliver the debate. There will be none of this business of the executive treating this parliament with contempt, denying people an opportunity to properly put points of view, even denying the opposition the opportunity to put appropriate points to government which, from time to time in the last parliament, almost saved your hides. I can remember sitting down with a former Minister for Veterans' Affairs, now no longer a member of this place, and telling him that I had saved him from himself. He had the good sense to accept my amendment on that occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you come up with a good idea&mdash;and I am not holding my breath&mdash;we will not be too slow to recognise it if it is in the interests of the people. We will not have the outrageous approach used by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) when he used to say, `If you've got the numbers, why don't you use them?'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker. I will continue with the reference to these other matters. When we look at this particular set of amendments, it is somewhat difficult to see why a lot of the matters have been included because they seem to be exactly the same. I assume it is only <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that they have chosen to rewrite the whole of the clauses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But up&hyphen;front the point is that you want shorter working hours. You are proposing, as we see here in your amendment, to reduce the day by bringing on the adjournment debate at 8 p.m. on sitting Mondays and Tuesdays and 5.30 p.m. on Wednesdays and Thursdays.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple fact of life is that on two days of the week it is reasonable and possible for members to accommodate those additional hours. There are a lot of people who would be denied the opportunity to make their contribution in this place if those hours were not made available. So the reality is that we see no problem with that and, of course, we support it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I might add that, all in all, it is about time that a government stood up at the beginning of a parliamentary term and put these motions and these proposals down in the standing orders&mdash;not as a knee-jerk reaction, as has so often occurred in times gone by. In fact, as you would remember, Mr Deputy Speaker, we had the Speaker of this House stand up one day and make recommendations to us which we as a parliament had authorised him to make; and the next day we had the Leader of the House, on the then Prime Minister's instructions, come in here and pull the rug out from under his own Speaker&mdash;a practice of course that is not unique to the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a fellow called Jim Cope, and they would not even support him when he tried to discipline one of their ministers. They left him sitting in the chair, a lame duck Speaker. Of course, at that time he had had the courage to do what was necessary. He resigned from the chair; others have just kept the money. So the reality is that we are in this situation again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there would be no doubt other members here who wish to refer to the specific provisions, the subject of this motion, and the opposition's amendment which I reject wholeheartedly. The reality is that I would like to give them time to make some remarks. Apparently I will get the opportunity to talk about broadcasting a little later, and there are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="96"> some quite significant comments I want to make on that subject.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I guess in a lot of ways we owe the Liberal Party a favour in not making the member for O'Connor the Speaker of this House because we would not get these sorts of inflammatory speeches from him otherwise&mdash;although I guess if he had become the Speaker he might have started making them from the chair and would have broken a bit of new ground there. The spread of hours of the House probably does not matter all that much to the member for O'Connor. The member for O'Connor I do not think would mind if we sat here till midnight because he, among all members, has the simple expedient for getting around whenever the House sits: he just gets himself thrown out at question time whenever he has a pressing engagement. Whether it is to go to the races or whatever, the member for O'Connor can always find a way to get out. Maybe, to accommodate him, we should have put an <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> amendment in that would provide for the adjournment debate to be at half past one&mdash;</PARA>

Mr Deputy Speaker, the fact of the matter is that the issue that the Procedure Committee's reports have brought down which has been the most widely discussed in this House over the years has been the times of sitting. The one thing that there was widespread agreement about was that 11 o'clock was just too late.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Her colleague and partner in crime at that time was my dear friend the member for Moore (Mr Filing). The member for Moore was the Leader of the House's other nominee on this committee. In relation to the minority report, the member for Moore said on 28 October:</PARA>

How can this place operate effectively if members who have brought their families to Canberra have to be locked up here until 11 o'clock at night? It seems like the government have this really bizarre attitude that they are going to turn this place into a big boarding school and that members could not be let out at 8 o'clock at night because that might lead to dancing or something.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) made some reference to the fact that I was a member of the Procedure Committee when it brought in the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">About time</EMPHASIS>. In fact, I was the deputy chair of that committee. I note that some other members of the committee are in the chamber today but not the chairman, who became the High Commissioner to London after the report was tabled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a number of things to say, and I do not intend to respond in any great length to the comments of the member for Watson except to say this. In 1979, when I was in a previous political incarnation in another chamber, I chaired a government members' committee that looked at sitting hours. After extensive consultation with staff, members of the opposition and everybody else, we brought in a report which was thrown out by the government of the day. In 1981 that committee was revived following the premature death of Senator John Knight at the age of 38. The committee brought down another report which was again rejected by the government of the day but which led to some amended hours in the Senate following a free vote in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Through all that procedure various people said to me, `Look, we really have gone down this path endless times before.' Former Senator Fred Chaney's father had also apparently tried to do something about the sitting hours when he was a member in the 1950s. There are a lot of new members in the chamber today, and I say to them that they will have this debate in the parliament a lot of times in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="100"> their political incarnations and they will all get a go at it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is good now and we will spend a couple of minutes debating it, but the motion the government has moved does far more profound things than changing the sitting hours. The government's motion goes to the heart of the operation of this chamber and indeed of parliamentary democracy. So I am not going to spend all my time commenting on sitting hours, as the honourable member for Watson did, except to say this. The member for Moore (Mr Filing) and I put forward a dissenting report to the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">About time</EMPHASIS>  which included sitting hours. We put forward a different set of hours, and that was rejected by government and opposition alike. I have to say that there was not any consensus. I recall that there was a certain amount of ramming down necks, as the member for Moore will bear out. In fact, there was not much interest at all in consensus when discussing the dividing issue of sitting hours. I hope in future whenever the subject is debated again&mdash;and I am sure it will not be this year&mdash;that we might again canvass some of those options.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The essence of this debate is far more important things. It is the matter of the parliamentary roster. I pay tribute to the member for Hotham (Mr Crean). I am pleased to see that he is the Manager of Opposition Business. I paid him this tribute before when he was a minister in the previous government: he was the only minister who, when conducting his own business in this chamber, took pains to meet the political and parliamentary niceties. It is a welcome change that we will have someone who acknowledges the importance of parliament running affairs for the Labor Party in this parliament. I am sure he is more than a little embarrassed by some of the things that he had to do and say today, but I hope that is an indication that over time government and opposition in this chamber will move forward to a better parliamentary procedure. The motion that the Leader of the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> House (Mr Reith) has put down today is a first step in that process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first point is the matter of the question time roster. Many were the times when we were sitting on the other side of the House that the then Leader of the House, now the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), got up and was wont to use as defence on things like the debacle of the question time roster we had: `Oh, but reforms were recommended in the Procedure Committee report.' In fact, only a minority of the reforms that were recommended in that report were implemented by the then government and we had bastardised versions of other recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the record, and for the interest particularly of new members, the then opposition, by consensus with the government on that occasion, did agree to a trial of a limited roster in question time. It was that on Mondays&mdash;and Mondays only&mdash;there would be a limited roster, on the understanding that if the opposition wanted to question a minister who was not on the roster it had the right to veto that minister's absence. So the opposition had the right to call for a minister who was rostered off&mdash;only on that Monday&mdash;to be in here to answer questions. That is all the roster was. We agreed under some pressure but wanting, maybe, to be reasonable, to free up question time a little, so that on the Monday of sitting weeks some ministers could be absent by agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, there had to be consultation between government and opposition. The Leader of the House now, who was then the Manager of Opposition Business, is well aware of the fact&mdash;and would agree with me&mdash;that every now and then the then government used to come out with a new roster&mdash;never mind only for Mondays, but for the whole week. There was never any consultation by the government. It was a case of: `We'll fax it through to your office.' The Leader of the House agrees. That is as much consultation as there was. It was faxed to everybody else at exactly the same time and it was, simply, `like it or lump it'. There was no consultation. There was no to or fro between government and opposition. It was <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="101"> just: `cop it sweet'. That was the record of the Labor government here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government has now decided to scrap the roster because it was a mess, it was a debacle, it was an insult to the people of Australia. Question time is a critical time for government and opposition members to question the executive government. It is not the members who are important in this; it is the people on whose behalf they do the questioning, the people they represent&mdash;the people of Australia. Question time is a critical time in the operation of our whole parliamentary democracy. It is not for the benefit of opposition members or of government members but for the benefit of the people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will make a quick reference to the previous 3 o'clock timing of question time versus the 2.30 timing which was recommended by the Procedure Committee and the 2 o'clock timing being proposed today. The 2.30 timing was an attempt at consensus and consideration. At the time that it appeared to be emerging that the committee was going to come to a 2.30 recommendation&mdash;and somehow these things had a way of appearing in print in the newspaper; we never did quite identify who was responsible for all those leaks, although I think if you read the debate you would have a fair idea who most of us thought it was. The ABC communicated with the committee and pointed out that if we had a 2.30 start to question time, and if we went the normal 45 minutes that the House then had for question time, we would be overlapping its children's program and that this had serious programming implications for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not watch the ABC at 3 o'clock in the afternoon ever, whether parliament is sitting or not. It is a time when I am at work so I was not aware, as I am sure nearly all of the other members of the committee were not aware, of the ABC television programming imperatives at 3 o'clock. So we proceeded to a 2.30 recommendation in the knowledge that that would mean the truncation of the broadcasting of the House of Representatives, although we always hoped that the ABC might be prepared to shift a few minutes for <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> us. In the event, when we started on that procedure&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mrs Crosio interjecting</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3E4">Mrs SULLIVAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is exactly what I am talking about. I point out to the member for Prospect that she was quite happy to sit there while members of the opposition raised the issue which I am rebutting, without feeling the need to raise the matter of relevance with the then occupant of the chair.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we had embarked on that procedure in ignorance of the ABC situation. The Keating government, in its party room, jettisoned the committee's recommendation of 2.30 and went for 3 o'clock, which it knew the ABC absolutely would not accept. It knew that there would be absolutely no room for manoeuvre and for broadcasting the House of Representatives question time, which prior to that time had been broadcast on alternate days with the Senate. So we had the situation where the Senate was then broadcast every day and we were broadcast at midnight, or 1 o'clock in the morning or something like that, apart from the little colour pieces that used to appear on the evening television news.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So in moving back to 2 o'clock, the government has made a decision. The 2.30 time was proposed by the Procedure Committee out of consideration for ministers and ministers' commitments, to make it a little easier for them to attend question time than 2 o'clock did. This government has taken the one decision it is perfectly entitled to decide to take, that is, that ministers are going to have to be here at 2 o'clock. It is not asking for any leeway for its ministers. I do not see how anybody could possibly object if the government has decided to inflict on itself something that the Procedure Committee would have been a little kinder to it about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also welcome the change in the second reading speech situation. For the benefit of members who were not here, there was a time, when it was moved that a bill be read a second time, that the minister would then give the second reading speech, that is, the speech to the parliament and to the public about the content of a bill that is being presented for debate together with its rationale. The debate would then be adjourned after <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="102"> the second reading speech, the procedure for many years. What the Keating government did was knock out the minister's second reading speech at that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under Labor, we did not get the minister's second reading speech until the bill was going into its full-scale debate, which meant that shadow ministers and members participating in the debate did not have access to that speech, to that explanation or to the political rationalisation, did not have the minister's words to echo or rebut, whatever the case might be. I know that there were some ministers who, when approached by the shadow minister, would make the second reading speech available in advance of the debate&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not always. The member for Prospect can speak only for herself. That is absolutely not right. You were a parliamentary secretary and I was a shadow parliamentary secretary. I know the difficulty we had in getting out of the office of the minister for health a second reading speech on any health bill. I know because in those days I had to speak on health bills on behalf of the opposition. You could not get it, except maybe half an hour beforehand if you were lucky. There was many a shadow minister who could say the same.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We shall return to the opposition the courtesy and the advantage of knowing the content of the second reading speech. It is not a case of returning it to the opposition but, rather, returning it to the people of Australia. When a law is proposed in this parliament members are entitled to know the rationale and real implications of that law so that they are able to debate it in a way that their constituents are entitled to expect they would. I welcome that change. That was also a recommendation of the Procedure Committee which was not taken up by the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, because time is limited, I want to say a few words about the grievance debate. A quite incorrect assertion was made by the opposition when that was mentioned earlier today. I welcome the fact that we will have a guaranteed minimum time for the grievance debate. In theory we had that under the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> arrangements that the previous government put in place, but it did not happen. There was a theoretical time for question time but it habitually went over time. This was not to the advantage of members asking questions. It was due to the fact that we used to get six&hyphen; to 10&hyphen;minute government diatribes&mdash;they were not answers to questions. We had record low numbers of questions despite a record length of time for question time. On Mondays it was the grievance debate that was truncated by the extended answers to questions by then government ministers. That was what happened to the grievance debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Procedure Committee addressed this when it revisited the earlier changes and it recommended a guaranteed minimum time for the grievance debate. If you go back to that report that revisits the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">About time </EMPHASIS>changes you will find that the truncation of time for the grievance debate was specifically addressed. It became a specific subsequent recommendation of the Procedure Committee that the grievance debate ought to have a guaranteed time. I particularly welcome that review and that aspect of the motion moved by the Leader of the House today.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I formally congratulate you, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, on your election to this very important position in this parliament. I think this particular debate is timely and relevant. I want to congratulate the government for taking some of the initiatives it has in respect of the matters that have been brought before us today. I also want to take up the challenge which was issued by my good friend the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) that if there is a good idea then people should be prepared to listen to it. I would like to make a couple of suggestions in respect of how additional improvements could be made in terms of the work ability of this place which the government may wish to consider.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="103"> Much has been said about sitting times. Much has been said about occupational health and safety issues. I am pleased that the views of both sides of the House about occupational health and safety have been quoted in this place. There is no doubt that they are con siderations that we need to put in place and into perspective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When talking about extending sitting hours, it is not simply a question of what is best for the 148 members of the House of Representatives. What we are talking about is the effect that would have on the people who work within this building and service the needs of the 148 members of the House of Representatives. As many people are probably aware, the fact that people associated with the Department of the House of Representatives put together information for us about the day's proceedings and tidy up what actually happened during the course of the day means that, at 11 o'clock at night when the bells ring and members can go home or wherever else they might want to go, many of those people will have to remain here. They will be expected to be here at 7.30 or 8 o'clock the next morning to get prepared for the ensuing day. I think those sorts of issues are worthy of consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the House (Mr Reith) states in the last section of the motion before us today that the Standing Committee on Procedure should actually review any further changes to the times of sitting of the House and report back. I hope that might embrace this specific matter about the occupants of this building and the effect changes to sitting times might have on them. He might also consult with the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on this because I know the Prime Minister is health conscious. I know that he is concerned about his level of physical fitness, as we all should be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we have to extend that argument to include the people who work directly for us in our offices and the other occupants of this building. This does not just affect the clerks and their staff but also affects <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, the people in the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff more generally and a whole range of people. I think these issues are worthy of further consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to very briefly say something about the 2 o'clock kick&hyphen;off for question time. I frankly think that is a change for the better. One of the things that has always been of great concern to me in this place is that we <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have become very much a disseminator of entertainment and not so much a disseminator of information. If a wider audience tunes in&mdash;the half a dozen people that like to watch question time at 2 o'clock in the afternoon on the ABC&mdash;they will start to actually see what happens in one segment of the day, not the whole of the parliamentary day. Look at us now. There are a range of people in here who hold a range views. The question time frenzy and activity is not evident here. That is always the case, save for the one hour of question time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But information dissemination through live television coverage is very important. At the risk of offending standing order 82 on anticipation of debate, in respect of the proposition by the Leader of the House on broadcasting what can go out, I quote the former leader on this side of the place: `You've got it dead right.' So I congratulate you for that particular change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also make a couple of suggestions to the Leader of the House which you have not picked up here, because I do not think that some of these changes you are suggesting go far enough. They certainly do not address the sorts of issues that used to ring around my ears in question time, particularly the relevancy of answers given by ministers or indeed the length of answers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My colleague the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) mentioned in passing the length of answers which ministers gave. Can I suggest to all newer members in this place that, if they have not already, they get hold of the standing orders and they read standing order 144 relevant to questions and 145 relevant to answers. You will see an amazing difference. The subtlety even escapes people in the media in this place, because 144 lists very carefully rules applying to questions. Taking it further and getting the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS> and looking at the way Speakers have interpreted this, you will see very tight rules on questions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But when it comes to answers, and again the point made by the member for Moncrieff on whether it be relevancy or length, the standing orders are silent, save for 145, which says answers must be relevant to a question. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="104"> Then it is up to the incumbent in the chair to determine whether an answer has been relevant or not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Time and time again in my incumbency in that position, members of the opposition would rise in their places, stride manfully&mdash;or womanfully&mdash;to the dispatch box, often because they were frontbenchers, and say, `Mr Speaker, a point of order. I draw your attention to the length of answers of this minister,' or `I draw your attention to the relevance of what the minister is saying.' Time and time again the occupant of the Speaker's chair had his or her hands tied because of the procedures dictated by this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to the Leader of the House, because he was one that frequently took up those concerns with me when I was Speaker, it is time that we addressed that very seriously. The Procedure Committee in the past made recommendations about this. The Senate have actually acted on it&mdash;there is one minute for a question and, I think, four minutes for an answer. It is time that we looked at ourselves and asked whether a time limit is required in that respect. Or will we see, as part of the new approach in this place to government, those ministers on the front bench, when asked a series of very serious, far&hyphen;reaching and searching questions by opposition, give relevant and short responses? Only time will tell. But it may well be that this is an issue we will revisit. It may well be, and it may not be too far down the track, that people on this side of the parliament will rise to seek the call from the Speaker to raise the issue of relevancy and the length of answers of ministers, just as they always have done. If we are to get this place to work a little more effectively, particularly at that time and especially now with the change to 2 o'clock when we will see a live broadcast of our question time, at least two days a week I would imagine, then maybe we need to clean up that part of our act as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> I might just say to the member for Moncrieff in response to her contribution on the 2.30 or 2 o'clock or 3 o'clock start to question time, that 3 o'clock actually is when <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sesame Street</EMPHASIS> is on the ABC. In negotiations which were held when the government decid ed to change question time from 2 o'clock to 3 o'clock, it was true that the ABC said they would not under any circumstances interrupt children's programming to put on the House of Representatives. So it had to be on for all the insomniacs at 1 a.m. the next day. Whether it goes to the question of one children's program upsetting another and competing needs, I am not sure. But, seriously, those are the sorts of things that we must keep in mind, too, when we talk about information rather than entertainment coming out of this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other issue which I should mention where I said I did have a couple of suggestions&mdash;and I hope the Leader of the House is listening to this&mdash;is the fact that the second chamber may be put to better use. When this particular facility was put in place, the idea was that by establishing virtually a duplicate of the House of Representatives we might see non&hyphen;contentious legislation, committee reports and others go there for consideration. I suggest to you, through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that maybe that is something that can be revisited. Maybe a lot more material from the House could be referred to the second chamber, to the Main Committee, for consideration. In that way not only would we increase the time in which that particular body sits, but the amount of material, legislation, debates and other things that members are so concerned about might not be enacted through this place. If we are serious about giving ourselves time for debate, for serious issues to be considered here, then there is nothing wrong with that happening in the Main Committee. I just suggest to the Leader of the House that that might be something that he needs to look at. It may require some changes to the way in which that particular second chamber was established. I am not quite sure whether it would need changes to the standing orders, but perhaps it may.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me conclude by again saying to the Leader of the House that I think it is important for us to look at sitting times very carefully in terms of occupational health and safety issues. Many arguments have been mounted in this place. I understand the Leader of the House's desire and need to have more business go through this place, but my suggestion <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="105"> to you is that it might better suit our purposes if the Main Committee was put to further use. The beneficiary from this arrangement to extend sittings in this place on Monday and Tuesday nights can only be the Hyatt, with the fixed meal time being put in place. There is no question about that at all and good luck to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, we do need to consider the occupational health and safety issues carefully. I suggest to you, Leader of the House, that you act on your convictions and act on what you always put to me when the roles were somewhat reversed in the last parliament. You should look at standing order 145 and see whether you are prepared to recommend some changes to the standing orders so that definitions of things such as the relevance of answers and length of answers are picked up. You should make some genuine suggestions as to how question time may improve even more. I understand that you have a genuine desire to do so, and I can only applaud that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With television coverage now being broadcast live, more people will watch it. It will and should be about information; it should not be about theatrics or entertainment. I have no doubt there will be some theatrics and entertainment, and there is always a place for some of that. But at the end of the day, if we are serious about changing the way this place operates, I would hope that some of those suggestions gain favour from the government and are given serious consideration. The other proposals&mdash;such as changing standing order 150 to make ministerial replies 60 days&mdash;are excellent. I heartily concur with the other changes that you have proposed.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to follow the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) in this debate. I think his contribution was meritorious and I agree with many of the issues he raised, particularly those associated with the standing orders surrounding question time. It is interesting to note his observations as he views question time from a different perspective, now that he no longer occupies the chair.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">May I take this opportunity, as an aside, to compliment the member for Cunningham on <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> his role as Speaker of this House. He was an adornment to the office. I know on occasions that we on this side were critical of some of his decisions, but he demonstrated a kindly authority in the chair that was appreciated by members. Frankly, I think there was a reasonable degree of order in the House on most occasions when the former Prime Minister was not present, and the departure from this House of the not lamented former Prime Minister does give us a new opportunity to raise the standards of parliamentary debate and, hopefully, the way the public sees this House function.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the context of making asides, may I also congratulate you, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, on your return to the Speaker's chair, if in a somewhat slightly different position, but obviously as elevated as possible from somebody in opposition. I also congratulate Speaker Halverson and the others who will fill that chair in this new parliament. You have a very important role as Speaker and Deputy Speakers to exercise your authority in this place and ensure that the tone of the chamber reflects the fact that this is a place of business and that a workmanlike attitude needs to be demonstrated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But that responsibility is not entirely yours. All  members of this chamber have a responsibility to ensure that our 38th parliament is better than the previous one and that it functions in a way which will restore the public's confidence in the way in which our democratic process works. Sad as I am to say this, the fact is that the Australian people have been losing confidence in our federal parliamentary system because of their perception that parliamentarians have been out of touch with the feelings of ordinary Australians and have not behaved in the way they should have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That impression has been largely gained by the short news clips of question time shown on television. These were sadly often rowdy and showed that the debate seemed to be out of control and irrelevant. That is sad for members of parliament and detrimental to the standing that we have in our own communities but, more importantly, it is a threat to our very democracy.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="106">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If people lose confidence in our parliamentary system, the very future of our democracy is at risk. This place is supposed to be at the centre of our democratic system and, if people do not have confidence in the way we operate, they question the very reason for having a democracy and the way in which our representative system works. We need to be seen as hardworking, industrious, fair, responsible and efficient. Every member has a role to ensure that those standards are maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, parliamentarians are human beings so we make mistakes like others. Inevitably, some will perform better than others, but members need to always appreciate that they have to behave responsibly because their irresponsibility may damage not only themselves but the very institution of parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The media also has a responsibility to more fairly represent what happens in this parliament. The brief television news clips do this parliament a disservice. They pick out a few rowdy seconds and ignore the hours of detailed debate and careful consideration of the issues of the day which may have occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said before, the departure of the former Prime Minister will help in this regard. There are still plenty of vigorous debaters in this chamber. The current Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) have reputations&mdash;justly earned&mdash;for being outstanding contributors to this parliament but, fortunately, they do not regularly resort to the personal attacks, insults and bad language which characterised the former Prime Minister's performance. We must all make sure that we do not resort to silly name calling and making those idiotic comments that were sometimes made. By behaving better, we will be able to restore the public's confidence in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed changes to the standing orders that are before the House at the present time make a substantial contribution towards improving the way in which this parliament functions. I particularly welcome the Prime Minister's assurance that all ministers will be present for question time. It really was demeaning for the former government when the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> television cameras panned across the ministerial benches during question time and showed that they were half empty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am gratified to notice that members of the opposition are not opposing this change but, unfortunately, they have not given a commitment that if they were ever to be returned to government they would not resort to their previous bad habits. Are we going to have rostered days off for the shadow ministers? Are we going to have only half the shadow ministers turning up in spite of the fact that all the ministers are going to be present? I commend Prime Minister Howard on taking this initiative and restoring the accountability of the ministry to the parliament by ensuring that all ministers are present.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very difficult for an opposition to mount a concerted attack on a minister who may be deficient in his or her administration if that minister does not turn up every second day. You could have a minister almost ready to fall on his or her sword, and then he or she goes away for a holiday. The momentum is lost by the next occasion. We on this side of the House are confident in our ministers' capacity to perform. They do not need to hide behind a bush every second day. They will be here to answer questions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also particularly important that the second reading speech be provided at the time a measure is being introduced into parliament so there is adequate time to fairly consider what is intended by the legislation. That will also contribute to the quality of the debate when matters are before the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to mention the importance of the role ministers can play in raising the standards of the House. It is important, as the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) said, that ministers be present when their legislation is debated in the chamber so that they are able to respond to important issues raised by opposition and, indeed, government members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="107"> Worthwhile suggestions often come from the other side and need to be incorporated in legislation. What has been happening in the parliament over the last six or so years is that this House has been used as a rubber stamp and the real, detailed consideration of legisla tion occurs in the other place. That has lowered the significance of debate in this chamber, but that will be restored if ministers are here, are prepared to take on board suggestions which are made during the debate on legislation and are prepared to make amendments where necessary in this place, rather than having the humiliation of having to accept amendments that are initiated in the Senate and then need to be reintroduced in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope also that ministers will be more involved in the second chamber. I was interested in the comments by the member for Cunningham on the second chamber. If we are to make that second chamber a really meaningful part of the debating processes of the parliament, ministers need to attend there as well or, if it is a debate on a committee report, the committee chair should attend so that place has the dignity and aura associated with the debate of a federal parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also note with interest that a ministerial statement is scheduled for today. I hope that is an indication that in future government policy announcements will be made in this place rather than by press release, at the National Press Club or at other places. I note the criticism that this matter we are dealing with now came on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> only this morning, but this is the first working day of sittings.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was on the Procedure Committee in the parliament before last and we presented at least ten committee reports. Very few, if any, were acted on by the government of the day.

Everyone knows how to fix it, but we never get around to doing it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, I congratulate you on your election to your illustrious position. May I make the point which was made by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) yesterday that there is clearly a great expectation with the election of this new government, a government committed to improving the standards in this chamber&mdash;standards of behaviour; standards of debate; standards of processes; and, in the case of ministerial responsibility, standards of ministerial accountability to the chamber&mdash;that, as a consequence, what is happening today and what will happen in the next few days and weeks of the parliamentary session will be of great interest to the community. They will be watching us and saying, `Are we really going to get some changes or aren't we?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In looking at the government's proposed changes to the standing orders, I am very much encouraged in certain of the aspects. In particular, I am encouraged by the changes relating to question time, which is certainly a critical part of our working day. It is the part of the day which most people outside of the parliament get to see as far as media attention is concerned. It is the point at which the House of Representatives effectively works, or can or should work, because it is a time when members can direct questions straight to a minister about important matters relating to the administration of their portfolios.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to make a couple of comments in response to comments made earlier by the member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) in relation to earlier debates about the changes which were made in the last parliament, particularly to sitting hours. I was one of the authors of the minority report, as the member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) mentioned, that was published alongside the report of the Procedure Committee. We had some concerns about the way in which the sitting hours were being changed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were certainly some strong concerns about the length of sitting hours. I recollect <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that Senator Herron, a very compelling person, a person of great standing in the medical community as well as now a minister of the Crown, had some very strong concerns about the health effects of sitting late. However, I am prepared, as I suppose a measure of trying to ensure this place works more effectively, to compromise. And it is a compromise: on Mondays and Tuesdays we will sit to 11 o'clock and the Wednesday and Thursday sittings times are being retained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is something that I, as a member of this chamber, am prepared to accept. I certainly do not have any problems with the consultation process at this stage. There was certainly a fair bit of debate in the community about the changes that were necessary to make this chamber work more effectively. But if the Procedure Committee is to have an effective role&mdash;I particularly direct my remarks via you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to the Leader of the House (Mr Reith)&mdash;there has to be some acknowledgment by the government that all of the work of the Procedure Committee is not merely an exercise in futility. That certainly was the case in the previous government's term of office. It was certainly the case when I was a member of that committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), who is sitting nearby, was a very good chairman of that committee. I was very impressed with his chairmanship of the committee. I do not want to put words in his mouth, but at times I felt that he, too, felt utterly frustrated at times when we wanted to make changes and the then Keating government refused to make them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am certainly keen to see the Procedure Committee become a very effective and integral part of our processes&mdash;so much so that I would like to see, for instance, one of the Independents have by right a position on that committee so that they are able to participate and ensure that the interests of independent members are also represented in relation to any changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just as an aside in relation to sitting hours: I am conscious that no doubt the changes to sitting hours have a big impact on the catering arrangements here. I noticed yesterday's <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="109"> circular to members mentioned there have been some substantial savings. I know they are part of the government's cost&hyphen;cutting measures. I certainly hope these changes to sitting hours are not going to be called the Hyatt clauses. I imagine that it is important for a catering contractor to have members in the House at some stage in the evening so they will buy dinner in the dining rooms. I hope that is not the case. I suggest the changes are, as has been presented, designed to allow the government and of course the House of Representatives to operate more effectively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Question time is absolutely critical, as I said earlier. The 3 p.m. starting time was wrong. The member for Moncrieff, the Deputy Speaker and I were critical of this. Interestingly, the 3 p.m. starting time effectively pushed the MPI off the scene as far as the media were concerned. In other words, there was no time between the MPI being staged and the electronic reporting of the day, particularly by television, for the MPI to be properly processed. So, if you were trying to launch an effective message in the MPI of the day, you could not count on any sort of television coverage whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That obviously suited the previous government because the MPI is often a vehicle for the opposition to raise during the day matters of importance and of course of note in the day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day running of a country. It is the only opportunity in some instances. Having that forced into oblivion as far as the media was concerned meant that an effective platform for proper scrutiny of ministerial responsibility was lost. I commend the Leader of the House for reintroducing the start of question time at 2 p.m. I think that is a very good change, and the government is to be congratulated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After skimming through the amendments proposed by the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), the Manager of Opposition Business, I see the only differences are the sitting times. Am I right that there is no other difference whatsoever?</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QT4">Mr FILING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Prospect, in her previous incarnation on the second bench of the government, would have been totally uncritical of any changes or any matters raised by the government. I am saying that I am prepared to compromise on this aspect. I think there is room for compromise. However, I will be looking at it, as I am sure a number of other members will be, to make sure that it is worth the effort&mdash;in other words, it does do something to make this place operate more effectively and does not result, as the member for Watson described, in people standing up brain dead in the chamber, which would be an unfortunate state of affairs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another point relates to questions on notice. No doubt the new Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull), who is sitting at the table, would be very quick to respond to questions on notice, being a very efficient minister. I am also conscious of the fact that at times members will, as we used to do ad nauseam, leap up and ask the Speaker to write to ministers to ask them to respond to questions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is proposed that the time frame for providing answers be changed from 90 days to 60 days. I was one of the people who proposed in the first place to have this changed in the standing orders. I was sick to the back teeth of having to wait six months to get an answer from ministers, who had all these staff to do the job. Now we have ministers with fewer staff, and less pay in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="110"> some instances, and the job will be done more quickly. That is a productivity increase. I am pleased to see that. We certainly hope we will get effective answers for our constituents' concerns more quickly&mdash;and, I might add, they will be real answers, not just prevarication, as has often been the case in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), as a parliamentary secretary, often took up causes. That leads me to my next point: the Main Committee. I was a critic of it in the first instance. I thought it would be just a second-rate chamber. But it has become an effective forum for members to raise their concerns&mdash;particularly in the very important take note debates, which have now become a very good medium. For those new members contemplating their participation in debates in the future, I suggest that they look for these take note debates. They are very useful ways of participating and getting your constituents' views across in the Main Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The one failing of consistent nature the previous government had was the fact that they did not have a minister or often a parliamentary secretary in the Main Committee during the second reading debate on a bill. That is an important part of any debate. If you are going to raise matters on behalf of constituents, then quite clearly you want to have somebody who will actually do something about it there and then with you in the Main Committee so that they can hear what you have to say.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Prospect, who is an adversary in political terms, did take up the cudgel a couple of times when I raised matters and I appreciated that. That is a good way of getting your constituents' concerns across and it is a valuable piece of time in our daily lives in the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope the government will insist on having either the appropriate minister or parliamentary secretary in the Main Committee when the second reading debates are being held and not have&mdash;as was the case in the previous parliament&mdash;the Chairman of Committees, for instance, who might have had some sort of relevance in getting the bill through the chamber on behalf of the government. That is absolutely critical to the better <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> interests of this chamber and I hope that will be something the government will take note of and make sure does not happen again. I am sure that if that is the case we will see the Main Committee become, as it already is, a more effective place in which members can raise matters of concern on behalf of their constituents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the criticisms in recent times is that this chamber has become more and more dominated by the interests of the big parties. I was in a big party at one stage and now I am an Independent member. Through cooperation, and with the ability for members to properly represent constituents not only at question time and in debates but also in committee work and all the other things that provide us with those opportunities, we will hopefully see a more effective House of Representatives that will be seen by the rest of the community to be doing its job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of us will have our own standing in the community raised from the bottom of the list, as I saw the other day, or just above state members of parliament, to a higher standing&mdash;perhaps up towards medical practitioners. I note that one of the new members is a medical practitioner and has taken a drop in the public standing of about 20 points, according to the list that was published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> recently. By making that chamber work more effectively we can raise our standing and indeed raise the reputation of the system to which we all subscribe.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are, though, a few matters that I want to get on the record in connection with these proposals. I appreciate the fact that at the start of a new parliament of this kind, when there has been quite a substantial change, there are time factors involved in the government getting legislation and motions into place. But I just want to put on record my concern, and it is a concern that should be shared particularly by new government members.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="111">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Until yesterday we saw these proposals only by way of a press release dated 31 March. I hope this will not be a government by press release. It is not fair to the opposition and it is not fair to government members. In connection with that matter it is important to draw attention to the fact that, since they did appear in this way, quite clearly they were not matters that were considered by the government parties. They may have been, but it is most unlikely that they were. It is most unlikely that the government parties endorsed all of the proposals in this motion and those which are to follow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the former chairman of the Procedure Committee which brought down the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Time for review</EMPHASIS>, I endorse most of the provisions that have been included in this motion. As members know, that report was a review of the initial report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">About time</EMPHASIS>, which introduced those major changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to do two things in connection with those reports. Firstly, I want to draw attention to the fact that&mdash;as indicated by the member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan), the former very competent deputy chair of that committee&mdash;while she and the Independent member for Moore (Mr Filing) had a minority report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">About time</EMPHASIS> report, their report, which also referred to sitting hours, did not in any way contest the time when the House would rise on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays. That time was to be 8 o'clock. That was proposed by the committee initially. It was also endorsed by the member for Moncrieff and the member for Moore in their dissenting report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The following quote was a unanimous response from members of all parties who participated in the Procedure Committee. In the report which reviewed those proposals, paragraph 9.2.8 on page 33 states, `It is recommended that no change be made to the sitting hours of the House.' A lot of the proposals that the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) has brought forward on behalf of the government are of course proposals which were suggested in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Time for review</EMPHASIS> and which I endorse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I do not endorse the sitting hours. I really believe those sitting hours are nonsensical. If it really is a matter of finding the additional <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 1&half; hours, then members know that our alternative proposal is the sensible way to go about it. Could I say to new members that, after you have been here for a while and are sitting around this place until 11 o'clock at night, I do not know what you will say to your constituents when they ask you how you can give sensible consideration to legislation when you are sitting into the middle of the night. That is what you will be asked, and the Leader of the House knows it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point has also been made about the enormous additional cost that is going to be involved. If we look at these proposals, we will sit on the Monday until 11 o'clock at night instead of 8 o'clock and we will achieve an extra 1&half; hours of debating time. But we will not make up any extra time on the second day, on the Tuesday. Although there will be an additional 4&half; hours that we have to remain in this building, we will have only 1&half; extra hours for debating time. That is not sensible. I make that point emphatically.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If it is not sensible, then you need to examine the real reasons why these changes have been introduced and why we are going to be required to stay in this building until 11 o'clock at night instead of getting out at 8 o'clock. I can only speculate about that, and I am sure you will as time proceeds&mdash;as you well should. Medical experts and members of the former parliament have indicated their concerns about those sitting hours and about members and staff being kept around here until 11 o'clock at night. It is nonsensical. They really should not have been introduced and I am disappointed that they have been. We can only speculate about the real reasons why they have been introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to emphasise a few other points in the limited time that I am going to take. The member for Moncrieff referred to the sitting hours proposed in her dissenting report and that of the Independent member for Moore to the initial report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Time for </EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">review</EMPHASIS>. I have emphasised that there were no proposals for a change to the end of the sitting day in their dissenting report. In connection with the grievance debate, the member for Moncrieff referred to the fact, as the Leader of the House has indicated, that there will be a firm <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="112"> time of one hour 20 minutes placed in the standing orders for the grievance debate to give backbench members&mdash;private members of this chamber&mdash;the right to make a contribution. While that did not exist under the previous arrangement, I think on every occasion&mdash;I can be corrected&mdash;the then Leader of the House, the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), moved that the time for the grievance debate be extended to ensure that all of that time was available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all accept the political rhetoric that is involved in debates of this kind and everyone, including the newer members, will become increasingly familiar with it and experienced in it. We are going to gain 1&half; extra hours in debating time by adding 4&half; hours to the time that we are required to be here, including finishing at 11 o'clock. We have suggested an alternative, and it really should be considered, where if the purpose of these changes is to get those 1&half; extra hours you can do so by adding an extra half an hour on to the three days. Instead of getting up at 11 o'clock at night, we would get up at 8.30 p.m. You people were not consulted about this. I hope that in your party rooms you are going to have your say&mdash;and I hope you do in future&mdash;because it does not make sense.</PARA>

I believe that my contribution will be so compelling that this might well be the first occasion when we have members from the government benches joining us over here. We'll see what happens. If we need additional time, the Main Committee, the second chamber, can be used more fully. Yesterday, the Governor-General said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a regrettable fact that, for various reasons, increasing numbers in the community have lost respect for the Parliament and its members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government will take steps to restore that respect. It will do so without in any way reducing the scope for robust debate which is one of the most valued features of our democratic tradition.</PARA>
<PARA>Robust debate at 11 o'clock at night! `To restore the respect of the parliament.' There are people out there who say, `What are you people on about? You set your own hours and you sit there until midnight.' Yesterday the Governor-General issued those words on behalf of the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, some young members, particularly, have said to me on previous occasions, `Look, if we've got to be in Canberra, let's sit late while we are there, so that we don't have to sit as many weeks and we <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="113"> can get back to our families.'  That makes sense. The problem is that the sitting weeks have not been in any way reduced. This extra time is not going to make it possible for you to get back home to your families. You will be here for the same number of days, but when you are here you will sit until 11 o'clock at night.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said we could speculate about the reasons for it. The reasons that have been given do not add up. They are not the real reasons. I think it is a nonsensical proposal. I think it is a foolish proposal. I am very disappointed that the proposal has been made because it does not accord with any of the consideration which has been given to these matters before. The additional time which will be available under the provisions that have been made, as opposed to our alternative proposal which would let us get away from this building at 8.30 p.m., will be zilch.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regardless of what the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) said&mdash;and I will be very quick because I am mindful of the maiden speeches about to be made&mdash;some things must be made very plain, particularly for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record in the future. What we have been talking about for the last few hours is that we in the opposition support the proposals before the House but we have shown realistically how time can be better served by making, as previous speakers from our side of the House have stated, a slight amendment to the recommendations before us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, when you read the motion, it seemed to one and all a very quick fix solution. We are saying it is all very well if you want to provide a quick fix to some of your problems. But realistically, why not, with a little more consultation and a little more debate in the House, which is what has been occurring here today, look to the future and see what could be done in a way which <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will possibly still provide the same avenues and the same amount of time in which to have further debate and further discussion of business?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I certainly commend the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) for his suggestion about using the second chamber more fully. Certainly, that has not been the case in the past. Mr Deputy Speaker, I think you, too, would agree that it is an avenue available to all members of the parliament, particularly government members, to make sure that that second chamber is used so that there is a little more ability for members to come forward and take part in debates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was a little disturbed about one point. When the member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) spoke, I did not mean to be offensive when I interjected. What I meant to say was that we do not need to sit here and listen to a trip down memory lane as to what has occurred since 1976. You are in government now. Let us look to the future. We in the opposition have said that some of the changes you are now making will be supported by us&mdash;and so we should support them. I refer to the 2 o'clock start for question time and the change regarding second reading speeches. I found it extraordinary that the member for Moncrieff said that she was never given a copy of a second reading speech by the then minister for health. I would like to question that further because I know that in my previous capacity, on behalf of my minister, we always made sure that the opposition spokesman was provided not only with the second reading speech but also with briefings by the department well before the actual debate took place in the House. So I find that extraordinary. They are matters that must also be corrected for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the areas that I find quite extraordinary is something we heard from the member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss)&mdash;in fact, almost ad nauseam. The member for Moore (Mr Filing) touched on it as well. I refer to the raising of standards. The Governor&hyphen;General, in speaking on behalf of the government yesterday, also mentioned it in his speech. I say to every member of parliament: you raise the standards from yourself first. Whether we sit later or <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="114"> whether we sit for shorter hours, whether we debate longer or whether we start question time at 2 o'clock, 3 o'clock or 9 o'clock, the standards come from the individual, first and foremost. This is something that was perpetually put out by the government when they were in opposition&mdash;that the standards of this House have gone down because of minister X, Y or Z or prime minister X, Y or Z. The standards of the House start with the individuals. Examine thy own first and then come forward with what standards, and standards in debate, should be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When personal attacks come forward, who makes them? It is not the sitting times of the House that cause a personal attack; it is the person, the individual. I find it appalling that we should be tarnished with one brush. As the old cliche goes, you don't throw out the whole box of apples because one of them has gone rotten. Also, as the member for Wide Bay tried to say repeatedly, even the media may start reporting more fairly the actions and statements of the parliament. The sitting times, such as a 2 o'clock start for question time, will not instruct the media of this country on how they will report or not report. Those are the points we must look at in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is very foolish that we are going to sit on Mondays and Tuesdays at those particular times when we realise how many years it has taken us to introduce more sensible times for debate. I believe that with a little more consideration we would have had a more sensible program. As has been indicated by opposition members, we support 99.9 per cent of the procedural motion before the House with regard to the changing of the standing orders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we talk about consultation, it is regardless of whether we in opposition are going to be consulted. That is not the point with regard to sitting hours. I wonder how much consultation was taken with the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> reporters, the attendants of the House or with those people who have to prepare the House for the next day. I do not think they were consulted; I do not think they were asked. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we talk about consultation, it must involve more than just us, the elected representatives. It must involve the people who provide the opportunities to keep this House running and also the people who must clean up after the event and make sure the House is ready for the next day. These are points that must be considered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I agree with a point that has already been picked up by previous speakers. It crossed my mind that, previously, the catering staff complained that we did not have an actual break and that we had a choice as to whether or not we stayed to eat in Parliament House. Perhaps on Monday and Tuesday nights the government is agreeing to say to the catering staff, `Yes, we will give you a commitment that we will provide a closed shop so that no one can move between the hours of 6.30 and 8 o'clock and they are going to have to participate in what is provided; otherwise they will go without.' After all, no&hyphen;one feels like eating at 12 o'clock at night. So if you do not eat at the desired time, that is an agreement we may hear about in the days ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I agree with everything we have put forward. I reiterate and confirm, as the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean) has stated, that we should have a little more consultation and a little more commonsense. Most particularly, with regard to sitting times, why don't we give a little further consideration to this matter? That is why I support the amendment that is before the House and will be voting for it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support the amendment moved by the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean) as it goes to what was regarded as the central feature of the Procedure Committee's report in 1993. Paragraph 131 of the Procedure Committee's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">About time</EMPHASIS> report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The central feature of the proposal remains the 8 o'clock adjournment, which we see as a critical feature of the change. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="115"> </PARA>
<PARA>The review of that report in 1995, the committee's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Time for review</EMPHASIS>  report, stuck to that central feature solidly. Yesterday, however, the Leader of the House said to the chamber:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In fact, the matters about which we have given notice have been to the Procedure Committee, were recommended by the committee and, of course, were not approved and taken up by the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA>In his comments earlier today, he referred to `virtually all the recommendations' and thereby gave himself a bit of space. Then to say, as he did, in respect of the proposed 11 o'clock close, that these changes had properly taken into account the views of the Procedure Committee is frankly disingenuous in the extreme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the House is a former suburban solicitor; he presumably knows the difference between innocent, negligent and fraudulent misrepresentations. He has been disingenuous in the extreme in trying to say that this is a sensible take-up of the Procedure Committee's recommendations. The Procedure Committee has reported, effectively, twice in the last three years and has said that for health, efficiency and cost reasons there should be an 8 o'clock close rather than an 11 o'clock close. That is the first point I briefly make.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point I make is on my own behalf and also on behalf of members from Western Australia. When change was made in late 1993 to take effect from early 1994, the price paid in terms of time&mdash;to bring the hours of closing down from 11 o'clock at night to 8 o'clock at night, which I supported&mdash;was that the House moved from a sitting pattern of Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday to Monday of each week; we moved from seven days to eight days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The price that Western Australian members paid for that was, effectively, 10 extra Sundays per year away from electorate and family. That price will remain to be paid, on the proposals moved by the Leader of the House, without any consequent advantages either to Western Australian members or to the House itself. The effect of the motion moved by the Leader of the House has been <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to increase our sittings by 1&half; hours&mdash;1&half; hours which can, of course, be competently and easily made up without an 11 o'clock close by the amendment moved by the Manager of Opposition Business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem that is caused for Western Australian members is that if we want to arrive in Canberra to sit on a Monday we have to travel on a Sunday. Under previous administrative arrangements, Western Australian members would leave Perth at 5.00 or 5.30 on a Sunday afternoon to travel to Melbourne and be taken by way of government VIP flights from Melbourne to arrive in Canberra at midnight or 1.00 a.m. That made sure that we had some capacity to discharge our local community and family obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of changes made by the current government, that arrangement is now off. If you want to travel from Western Australia to Canberra to sit on Monday, you need to catch a plane from Perth no later than 1 o'clock on Sunday afternoon.</PARA>

But you deprive Western Australian members of that for what? What you get is 1&half; hours extra sitting, and the price all members pay for that is the price to which attention was drawn by the Procedure Committee in two separate reports&mdash;health, efficiency and cost.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government resists the temptation to play the game as the previous government did. Our complaint is that the previous government did not treat the parliament in the way that it should have done. There has been much talk about consultation from the other side in the contribution to this debate. I can tell the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean) that I have spoken to him more about processes in this place in 24 hours than I spoke with the former Leader of the House in 12 months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of the changes that we have brought forward for today, we made a public statement of those at the end of March which gave him ample opportunity to put any alternative proposition. We have had no such proposition from him, no conversation with him, no initiative from him whatsoever until today&mdash;and he is the one talking about notice! It would make you choke to hear these people talk about consultation and wanting to develop and accept the basic spirit of the propositions which the government is putting. Therefore, I am going to be very brief.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a lot of conversation about sitting hours. The member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) made a very wise reflection on this: it has been a matter of ongoing debate for many years and there is sure to be continuing debate in the years ahead. That is a very sensible comment, and she put it in proper perspective because the other elements of this package are very significant. It is interesting <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that the other side basically have been shamed into now endorsing that which they never practised when they were in government; you never heard these members then standing and saying that we should have a more accountable parliament by the nature of the changes we are now proposing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are very conscious of occupational health and safety issues, but one has to remember that a few years ago we used to sit four nights a week. Furthermore, with the very poor management we had from those on the other side, at the end of a session we would have sittings until 1 o'clock, 2 o'clock and 3 o'clock in the morning. That was how those opposite used to run this place. However, there were some changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In comparison with what used to be the case, we are now proposing that we sit for two nights until 11 o'clock instead of the four nights that we once had to suffer. Of course, we are also providing further opportunities for party room meetings. These meetings are very important because they give backbenchers a chance to question the executive and the ministers on both sides of the fence. That is a sensible change which has been included in this program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had a lot of overblown rhetoric about late nights. The truth of the matter is that a lot of people work late in this building, regardless of whether we are sitting or not sitting. My view is that when the parliament is sitting we need to do all we can to provide people with as many opportunities to speak in this chamber as we can.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I welcome the number of constructive suggestions made during the debate. The member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) brings a lot of experience to this matter, and I appreciate that. I say to him and to other members who made constructive suggestions on matters which were additional to the standing orders before us today that obviously we will look at them. We welcome the tone in which they were put in the chamber today.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order! Those members disappearing out the back door should not do so. Taking advantage of a captive audience, I would like to make a few observations chiefly for the benefit of the very large number of new members but also, unfortunately, for the benefit of some of our longer standing members. Firstly, when the occupant of this chair stands it is obligatory on all members to resume their seats immediately and not to leave the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, yesterday one member brought in a mobile phone. That is out of order. No mobile phones will be brought into this chamber. Members might have noted that the member for Sydney was present for the division without wearing a jacket. That is admissible for divisions and quorums. The standing orders provide that any member doing so must leave immediately after the quorum or the division. I had occasion yesterday to caution two members about standing order 57, and I draw that to the attention of all members of this House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="118"> I would now like to make some mention of standing order 56. I will not go on at great length. I am sure we all agree that this chamber is the epitome of the representation of democracy and the freedom of the parliament and the people of Australia. That is expressed in the chair. We therefore believe that stand ing order 56 must be observed with proper respect for the chair and the standing orders of this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final point I would like to make is that we do have a number of maiden or first speeches coming up later in the day. Over recent years there has arisen an aberration where members and members of the public in the galleries have resorted to applause. I would like to inform all members that applause is out of order, particularly in the galleries. If you wish to express your approval, perhaps the traditional, `Hear, hear!' would be acceptable.</PARA></INTERJECT></PROCTEXT></DEBATE>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Non&hyphen;compliance with the guidelines listed above may incur penalties. Breaches of the guidelines and penalties are determined by the House members of the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings.

<PARA>This is again another one of the changes we are proposing to overcome restrictions imposed by the previous government at the behest of the then Prime Minister, Mr Keating, and the then Leader of the House, now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley). This measure restricted certain aspects of broadcasting, in particular the rebroadcasting of points of order. The proposed motion will require that broadcasts shall be used only for the purposes of fair and accurate reports and, furthermore, that reports of proceedings shall be such as to provide a balanced presentation of differing views.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This by and large reflects the practice in the Senate. It has worked quite satisfactorily. It was only the previous government's fixation for these matters and its enthusiasm for restricting broadcasting that this proposal was ever introduced in the first place. We are therefore overturning that and introducing what we think is a far more balanced and reasonable proposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to penalties, the only variation we have from the Senate conditions is the specific provision for the imposition of penalties for breaches. That is basically in the hands of the committee. To that extent, the provisions on penalties are effectively guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one last point I want to briefly mention. We have included in this motion a reference to the Main Committee. Where excerpts of the proceedings of the Main Committee have been used previously they <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="119"> have been assumed to operate under the same rules as for the House.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The grievance debate will also be moved forward to take place immediately after the presentation of petitions in order to avoid having to interrupt government business after question time. It just makes for easier flow. The intention at the present time is to devote as much time as possible to the address-in-reply debate during government business time on that day. This will enable private members to participate and new members to make maiden speeches. The government will be moving quickly to propose the appointment of a selection committee so that the opportunity to debate committee and delegation reports and private members' business can occur as soon as possible.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">May it please Your Excellency: <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="120"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We, the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Australia, in Parliament assembled, desire to express our loyalty to our Most Gracious Sovereign, and to thank Your Excellency for the speech which you have been pleased to address to Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>Before I begin, may I express my condolences to the families and friends who lost loved ones over these last few days in Port Arthur, Tasmania. And, Mr Deputy Speaker, may I congratulate you on your appointment. I was going to thank the opposition for the division&mdash;perhaps we could call it again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, this is indeed a historic occasion as I stand before you today not just as the member for Gilmore but as the first woman member for Gilmore. And I stand here as the member for Gilmore in a coalition government under the leadership of our Prime Minister, John Howard, the man who Australia believes in&mdash;for in John Howard and this government they see hope&mdash;hope for themselves, their families and their country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They see the return of fair reward for those who invest in and work for their country, at the same time expecting and receiving equal opportunities and security for all Australians. As someone who, with lots of help, doorknocked their entire electorate, the messages were loud and clear: `Get on with the job', `We understand the possible from the impossible' and `Let the private sector do what governments shouldn't be doing.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I stand here and look around this House, I see before me such a diversity of backgrounds and wealth of knowledge. I can also see for the first time in its history the greatest number of women who bring not only colour but also a diversity of skills and experience&mdash;women who were elected in their own right, on their own merits and performance. This has been achieved by a party under John Howard's leadership that believes in giving the job to the best candidate based on merit and not on quotas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I did not succeed without the support of such dedicated women as Chris McDiven, instigator and coordinator of the Liberal Women's Forum and President of the Federal Women's Committee&mdash;and individuals like Deborah Klika, who with her loyalty and trust helped me in being here today.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was not elected just because I am a woman. I believe we women were elected because our life experiences have given us the skills to equip us very well for life as a federal member&mdash;skills that maintain a balance in the decision making process and its outcomes. When one of the world's greatest leaders, Ghandi, was asked his reasons for always having women on his panel of advisers he said, `Women are logical in mind, compassionate in heart and caring all over.' One of these women later became Prime Minister of India, a nation of 800 million people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On a personal level, it will be a balance between work and family, a balance between local community needs and development, a balance between social needs and fiscal responsibility for all Australians&mdash;as well as providing a safety net for those who have suffered under the last 12 years of Labor inequities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, to the men in my life I owe a great deal: my father, for his strict upbringing and strong sense of fair play and my mentors, both here today, who took great pleasure in providing me with the opportunities to succeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To my former boss and lifetime friend, Mac Cott&mdash;you taught me well. To Col McPhedran, my adviser&mdash;from local government, to preselection and the lead&hyphen;up to my being here today&mdash;I thank you. It was you who always encouraged me with words of wisdom when the chips were down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My Dutch parents brought me to Australia when I was six years old. My father, a successful businessman in his homeland, decided that, because of an increasing population, fewer opportunities and a continuing concern from his activities in the Dutch underground, the future of his wife and four children would be better served in that young country, Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He wanted to seek that individual freedom and to make a contribution to the social, political and physical development of this country. It is my one regret that my father and best friend is not here to see this momentous occasion. He passed away many years <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="121"> ago&mdash;however, I know he is watching and is justifiably proud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Through my father, I became a great fan of Sir Robert Menzies. What I remembered and admired most was that he lived and worked within reality and always dealt proactively with community and special interest groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From an early age my father taught me that there are two kinds of people in this world&mdash;those who do all the work and those who take all the credit. `Jo', he said, `always be in the first group as there is far less competition.' He was right&mdash;for there are no short cuts in the learning process of life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Life in this new country for our family began on a farm cottage on the estate of Hopewood in Bowral, which in those days was also a home to homeless children from the United Kingdom, known as Dr Barnados Homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I left school at 15 to help with the family budget. Many of us here today will recall that in those days it was customary for girls to leave school whilst boys could continue their education&mdash;there was no such word as `discrimination'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My first thoughts of politics came when, as a mother of two daughters and not being 21, I was not able to vote for those who ran the country. Unbeknown to me it was the first chapter of my life in politics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today, 30 years later, I stand here with pride as the member for Gilmore&mdash;a marginal seat with an area of some 6,500 square kilometres and a population of 83,000 people, including three local government areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government totally ignored the basic infrastructure of regional development, dividing families and creating a sense of dependency rather than opening the doors to allow Australians to become competitive, generating needed investment, making Gilmore a better place to do business in and to live in and creating those much needed jobs. There is no denying the diversity of Gilmore with its wonderful mix of urban development, stunning beaches and foreshores which, together with a backdrop of mountain ranges, make it a visually exciting region. It provides enormous challenges for expansion of the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> significant tourist industry and our manufacturing, agricultural and commercial base.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Gilmore is on the move. However, we need help in order to help ourselves. Through you, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, I would like to give notice to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp), a former member for Gilmore and one whose constituents still remember and respect him for his understanding of the electorate and its people, that Gilmore urgently needs to have its road links in place, particularly the Princes Highway and trunk road 92. The people of Gilmore, especially the 7,600 small businesses, are delighted that this government has, once again, opened the door to regional development and infrastructure. For us the benefits and social wellbeing could very well be offset against capital costs. These same businesses are ready to employ extra staff, depending on the outcome of our industrial relations reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Gilmore is an environmental icon with its Jervis Bay and much can be done to enhance the opportunities that exist without having to resort to commercial overkill. I am a firm believer in quality tourism as opposed to quantity. Tourism has been my life for over 25 years. It has given me the background to understand the scope that exists for eco&hyphen;tourism. Appropriate choices of accommodation are urgently required if we are to avoid the tourist dollar from escaping.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The national parks, our greatest attraction, need to be the beneficiaries of that tourist dollar. However, it is my belief that the greatest potential for Gilmore lies in the development of marine based industries. Our location is ideal for aquaculture, marine transport, shipbuilding and fish farming, as well as forestry plantations, effective effluent dispersal and ethanol production.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Opportunities such as these signal the need for urgent commencement of a Shoalhaven university campus, as proposed by the Wollongong University. This campus would provide training, study and research programs, making it a leader in the New Age technology required for these commercially viable industries. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="122">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Gilmore is fortunate in that HMAS Albatross is one of the largest employers and contributors to our economy. The proposed expansion will allow for much needed growth and opportunities for our many skilled and unskilled workers. I believe it is the role of this government to provide those opportunities as defined in our pre&hyphen;election policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many in the community fear that development will bring about environmental disaster. This development must be addressed by sensitive, forward planning in consultation with the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also give notice to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) to expect a deputation from our fishing industry. The previous government's unrealistic and insensitive stand on fishing quotas has reduced a once proud and thriving industry to a mere handful of fishermen who no longer have the finances and strength to compete with increasing worldwide competition and bureaucratic red tape.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much has been said, but little has been done, about our forests. I see the need in Gilmore for forest plantations and management of existing resources, but this can only happen with the support and cooperation of our private land owners. I see my role as a local member in facilitating this process, using the opportunities provided by our environmental policy and the green core scheme for the unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Gilmore has the highest percentage of youth unemployment in New South Wales. One in three young people cannot find work. The greater percentage want to work and many still have the work ethic that this country grew up on. In addition, more thought needs to be given to the 33&hyphen; to 35&hyphen;year&hyphen;old age groups who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own, not to mention our significant aged population that has been neglected and ignored.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst I am intent on realising the future needs of Gilmore, I am also acutely aware of having to protect the lifestyle of those who chose to live in this unique environment. This can only be achieved by acceptable compromise and working closely with local, state and federal governments.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">May I now acquaint this House with the richness of Gilmore and its community groups. Never in all my travels have I seen such loyalty and unity within these organisations to protect and help those less fortunate. Many run on a shoestring budget, yet all are strong in voice and action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a revival in Christian principles as families were forced to rethink their values during the recession we had to have. Our church leaders are making a positive stand on political issues that they see as affecting the welfare of Gilmore. Much moral support was given and prayers offered to keep me strong and focused during the campaign. I feel very honoured to have been accepted by so many people of different beliefs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In our electorate there are many committees that were set up under the previous government with political emphasis instead of community or business based needs. I would fully support a move whereby these committees are reviewed, allowing those with genuine intent to become stronger and more productive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">May I just reflect on those final days of the campaign, the intense loneliness that goes with such a campaign and the immense warmth and loyalty from all those supporters who were there day in and day out, in particular, the residents of East Nowra who took pity on us whilst doorknocking in 40 degree heat. It was a very humbling experience and one that I will never forget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, I would like to thank all the Liberals from Sydney and Wagga and nearby electorates for their help and support. To David Gray, our local President and one of the most loyal Liberals I have been associated with: I thank you. To the campaign team and the door knockers, who gave 110 per cent: I thank you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thank you to the branch presidents and their members&mdash;John Lebas and Bede Devery of Kiama, Jo Vink and Mitchell Parks of Moss Vale, Phil Ballard of Berry, Val Noble of Gerringong, Ian Strathie of Nowra, John Ryan of Bomaderry and Joy Love from Ulladulla&mdash;with a very special thank you to Val Brealey and Jean Engisch. So many new friends were made.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="123">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To the young Liberals who worked night and day, not just for me but throughout New South Wales: your dedication fills me with great pride. I know that our future is in good hands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To Senator Michael Baume, whom I have known for over 20 years and who has always taken the time to listen, advise and assist: the people of Gilmore and I wish you well in your future challenges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would especially like to thank all those wonderful friends who are not Liberals, yet believed in me&mdash;people like Councillor David Lemerle who, despite my political persuasion, stuck by me. Others helped in order to see a future for their children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many aspects I would like to see changed in this House&mdash;in particular, the restoration of community beliefs in politics without fear or favour, especially amongst the young. It is time, as Justice Kirby said recently, that politicians return to what they were elected for&mdash;seeing that the business of politics is that of leading the community, not twisting in the wind to transient public opinion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, politics and its issues deserve to be fought with passion and even desperation, but nothing is to be gained by politics of personal attack. The consequence of any decision made is that there will be winners and losers. I hope we can grow to respect each other and to have debate resolved on the merits of issues and not on the strings of one's emotion or the loudness of one's voice. It takes courage to make a decision. It could mean the loss of friends and office. I thank here John Fahey, a man who stands tall and to me epitomises what I have just said.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to begin by offering my deepest sympathies to the grieving families and all those touched by this week's tragic events in Tasmania. My thoughts and those of my family and our prayers go out to these people as they try to make sense of this tragedy and piece their lives together again.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="124">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The newly formed electorate of Longman was named after the first woman ever to stand for and be elected to the Queensland state parliament. In fact, she was only the third woman ever to be elected to any Australian parliament. Irene Maud Longman represented the electorate of Bulimba from 1929 to 1932. As a conservative politician she represented the Progressive National Party. She was a long&hyphen;time member of the Queensland Women's Electoral League and the only woman of that organisation ever to be elected to parliament. I believe Irene Longman would be well pleased to see so many women from the non&hyphen;Labor side of politics elected to this place on their ability and their determination and without the demeaning and artificial quotas promoted by Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Longman electorate is extremely diverse, both demographically and geographically, stretching from the beautiful beaches of Bribie Island in the east through the major population centres of Caboolture and Narangba, Morayfield and Burpengary, and then out to the regional townships including Esk, Lowood, Laidley and Rosewood in the west. Longman extends in a band to the north and the west of Brisbane and covers an area of approximately 4,800 square kilometres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Longman could almost be described as two electorates in one, as the east and the west of the electorate are divided by the Daguilar Range. This poses its own very special problems as there is no connecting road between the east and the west of the electorate. Most of the 30,000 residents living in the west of the electorate have to travel for two hours through seven other electorates simply to visit my office. In simple terms, almost one&hyphen;third of all my constituents must drive past seven other federal members' offices en route to visit their own federal member.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a ludicrous situation and is hardly conducive to fair and equitable representation. Although the size of this electorate does not qualify it for a second electoral office, I encourage the Minister for Administrative Services, the Hon. David Jull, to consider this matter for the benefit of these affected communities. Regardless of this situation, I can assure all Longman residents, and particularly <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> those in the western communities, that I will work tirelessly to promote and represent this most important Queensland region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My election to this place is the culmination of 13 months of hard work by a dedicated team of people that I call the Longman Liberal team. As it is a new electorate with extremely limited resources and only a very small party structure, I realised that I had to build a team of loyal and dedicated supporters if I was to reach my objective of being the first member for Longman in the first Howard government. Any individual who wishes to be considered a leader must set standards and the example that they wish their supporters to follow. It was my belief at that time that the coming federal election was going to be a very tough fight indeed, and that the future of Australia, an Australia that I believe in passionately, was at stake. So it was an easy decision for me to dissolve my business partnership and to campaign full time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My wife, Sue, who I am glad to see is back from the Lodge to be in the gallery with our children, Thomas, James and Sarah, joined me as the first and the most dedicated member of the Longman team. Sue has shown me true love and commitment over the last 13 months in what have been some very trying times&mdash;in fact, she would probably say over the last 13 years there have been some trying times. I am indeed fortunate to have Sue as my wife and I thank her dearly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From this solid base we were offered the unqualified support of the Harris family, the Brownings and the Griffiths. These three families carried much of the workload over the following 13 months. Whilst literally hundreds of people assisted me to achieve this victory, a combination of party stalwarts such as the Aldens and the Wrights worked hand in hand with people such as Everald Compton, the Wildmans, the Taubmans, and a very special couple I shall never forget, Karyn and Roy Story. I thank each and every person who believed in the Liberal cause and who worked locally to achieve this victory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to acknowledge Senator David MacGibbon, who I am very pleased to say is in the gallery today, and his wonderful staff, Lorraine and Carmel, for their assistance <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="125"> and their guidance and quite often their patience over the last 13 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My Longman team was ably supported and directed by the state and federal secretariats. Andrew Robb, Lynton Crosby, Jim Barron and their capable teams were distant but vital members of our campaign. Their combined efforts kept us on track and focused. I would at this time like to make special mention of our Queensland state Liberal president, Bob Tucker, who has also seen fit to be here today. In my opinion, he has led the Queensland Liberals out of the wilderness and provided the strength of character and the leadership of a truly great man. I see he is joined by Don Walker in the gallery. He probably more than all others is responsible for my standing here because it was at his cajoling and prompting that I did take the first steps. For that I thank Don.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, our small team in Longman knows only too well that our efforts would have had minimal impact without the inspiration and the leadership of our Prime Minister, the honourable member for Bennelong, John Howard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was only because all of these elements worked together for a common goal that we achieved our objective. The same sense of purpose will be necessary to see Australia reach its potential and recover from 13 years of Labor's mismanagement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the past year I have continually listened to the electorate and developed a detailed knowledge of the many difficulties facing the people of Longman. Whilst many are common to all districts, some are more pronounced in particular localities. Bribie Island, for example, has a high concentration of retired families, people who came to live in this part of the world because of its natural beauty and its quiet lifestyle. A consequence of this migration of senior citizens has been the increased demand for retirement villages, aged persons hostels and nursing homes. As demand increases, waiting lists continue to grow, creating stress on frail and often vulnerable people.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is important for couples who have chosen to make places such as Bribie Island their home in later life that they can plan to remain with their friends in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a supportive community as their living arrangements change by necessity. A more flexible approach to our current system of determining hostel and nursing home places may be necessary to ensure that these facilities are available when and where they are most needed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of this region's senior citizens are from the veterans' community, men and women who have sacrificed much to ensure that we enjoy our freedom today. With the end of World War II now more than 50 years behind us, many people could be forgiven for thinking that the number of veterans and their spouses requiring assistance will soon be on the wane. This could not be further from the truth, as the Legacy organisation, which is dedicated to the care of war widows and their children, anticipates that demand will not peak for that organisation until the year 2005. Legacy is currently providing assistance to more than 125,000 widows and more than 3,000 children and disabled dependants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As an ex&hyphen;serviceman and a member of the RSL and the Vietnam Veterans Association, I am a strong advocate for this group of Australians who have given so much for our nation. The late Scotty Barrett, who passed away on 1 April 1996, was one of these World War II veterans who had a vision for the future of the RSL movement and its continuing development beyond the life of its current membership. Scotty founded the RSL community link program. Community link aims to show future generations of young Australians that the letters `RSL' stand for service to the community, decency and respect. These high principles are embodied in the RSL charter on Australian youth. I will read from it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a challenge for all Australians to work together in a social partnership involving youth which will help develop a future Australian society enriched by personal dignity and proper involvement for all.</PARA>
<PARA>Through the vision of Scotty Barrett, the tradition and legend of Anzac will live on in a very practical sense long after the last veteran has left us. I would also like to acknowledge three of Scotty's mates who are doing a great job to ensure the future success <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="126"> of the community link program. They are Vic Reading, Bill Gilmour and Allen Robinson.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like so much of south&hyphen;east Queensland, Longman has continued to experience rapid growth. Caboolture and Laidley shires were the ninth and the fourth fastest growing local government areas in Queensland in 1995. However, whilst this region's population continued to expand and the then Prime Minister, the Hon. Paul Keating, claimed, `This is as good as it gets,' mature and once stable businesses were closing their doors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Longman relies heavily&mdash;in fact, almost solely&mdash;on its small business community to provide local employment. The Longman small business sector is made up of a very diverse group. It includes small crop farmers, manufacturers, the retail sector and service providers. They know that business can, and should be, a whole lot better. The one trait that most of them have in common is their frustration with the previous Labor government's policies which restricted their growth and established bureaucratic barriers, particularly in the form of the unfair dismissal legislation. This single piece of legislation is the biggest disincentive to employment this nation has ever seen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's industrial relations package to be introduced into this House in the coming days will redress this situation and provide the impetus and the confidence for business to invest once again in Australia's greatest resource: its people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst this legislation will do much for the confidence of small business, the largest employer group in Australia, it will also require a concerted effort by the government, business and the wider community working together to realise each community's full employment potential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To this end, I have formed the Employment Council of Caboolture, which draws on the resources of the Youth Access Centre, the support of local business people and the services clubs to provide a network for young unemployed who desperately want to work. I believe that it will be through the combined experience, expertise and the attitude of these people that local communities will be able to work hand in hand with the government to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> redress the massive challenge of youth unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be remiss of me not to remind the House of the serious plight of Australia's farming community and particularly those farmers in the Brisbane Valley. This region of Queensland which produces dairy products, beef and a large range of fruits and vegetables is still drought declared. Unfortunately, it has been in the grip of drought now for more than five years. Whilst the rural communities were thankful for the fodder drives which brought much needed assistance, all the cattlemen of Longman ever saw were the trucks speeding down the Warrego Highway to destinations such as Charleville, Miles and Chinchilla. Some of these farms are located less than 50 kilometres from the Brisbane CBD, yet the drought has had the same devastating impact on them. The underground water supply continues to drop and the creeks have not run since 1992. It is essential that we continue to recognise the impact the drought is having on both farmers and the communities who rely so heavily on the jobs and the income they produce.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Occasions such as today provide an opportunity to reflect upon the people who have had the most impact on our lives. It has often been said that we are a product of the people that we are associated with. The three people who have had the greatest impact on my life&mdash;my wife, my mother and my father&mdash;have travelled from Queensland to be with me today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I take on the enormous challenge of this position, I am heartened by the fine example laid down by my father who has devoted his life to the service of the community. Throughout his life, my father has shown that determination and hard work can overcome almost any challenge. For most of us, life's challenges are not experienced until we leave the rather cocooned environment of our home and school. My father faced life's challenges at a much earlier age. He was struck down by polio at the age of four and he spent the next four years fighting for his life in hospital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While others may have felt sorry for themselves and been deterred from achieving, dad has never once bemoaned his condition nor <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="127"> looked upon it as a disability. In fact, he has always been thankful. He has been thankful for how lucky he is and he has undertaken a lifetime of service to those who are less fortunate. Although he has never had the satisfaction of running a mile or climbing a mountain, through his work with the community he has experienced an even greater level of satisfaction knowing that he has made a positive contribution to the lives of the people around him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst dad's work in the community has been recognised by numerous awards, my mother has also played an important role in this community service; not only by being the silent partner in all my father's activities but, more importantly, by shouldering much of the responsibility of raising our family and running our family's small business. Whereas my father instilled in me the valuable lessons of serving the community, lessons about running a small business and caring for a family were learned from my mother.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From a young age, I was taught that the keys to a successful business were long hours and hard work. I do not believe that recipe has changed to this day. Our family business required the combined efforts of all its members. Although my recollection of being the star performer may not be shared by my parents, or by my brother and sister for that matter, I can assure you that I will always be grateful for the opportunity and the insight that that business provided to me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to thank my parents publicly for providing me with the love, support and encouragement over the last 34 years which enable me to stand here today. Wherever life takes us, we are all influenced by the people we come in contact with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, I consider myself privileged to have friends like Brigadier Phillip McNamara and Helen Sweetman, both of whom I met during my time in the armed services. These wonderful Australians have demonstrated unbridled principle and commitment in every aspect of their lives. More recently, the Reverend Alan Colyer showed to me in a practical sense what is meant by true mateship, even when this meant a great <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> personal cost. It has been a pleasure to have known all of these people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my contact with the community during the recent election campaign, whether through information booths, door knocking or surveys, when asked what they expected from their federal representative, the overwhelming request was simply, `Do your best and be honest.' It is gratifying therefore that the government has reaffirmed many of its election commitments, including the people's convention and the protection of the Australian flag.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am an unashamed supporter of the Australian flag and believe that no one person or select group should be able to change it. Decisions such as these must always be left for the people. As the Prime Minister said recently, `Being in government is a gift from the Australian people and we should never take them for granted.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank the voters of Longman for the privilege and the trust that they have placed in me as their representative. The people of Longman have made it clear that they expect me to be honest in all I do and to do my best as their representative. I will always strive to fulfil this request to the best of my ability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is easy standing here today, having achieved a major goal, to be proud, to perhaps even gloat a little. The reality is that I am nothing without my faith and I would like to thank God for the opportunity to serve the people of Longman in this place as well as for enabling me to live in this great nation of ours. I commend this motion to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, I congratulate you on your appointment to that high office. I would also like to take this opportunity to commend both the member for Gilmore (Mrs Gash) and the member for Longman (Mr Brough) for delivering their first speeches to the House and to wish them well in their future endeavours.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to also place on record, before commencing my speech in the address&hyphen;in&hyphen;reply debate, my appreciation to both the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="128"> Prime Minister, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) for representing the members of this House in the ceremony this morning in Tasmania and letting the people of Tasmania and Australia know that we share their grief.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the address&hyphen;in&hyphen;reply as presented by the Governor&hyphen;General yesterday, I cannot help but recollect that the Prime Minister, in his acceptance speech on the night that he and his government were ushered into power, promised to lead a government for not only the people who had voted for him but also those who had voted against him. He asserted then that he would carry out his party's policies, which have been given an emphatic mandate, with fairness and understanding. His comments were the natural extension of a theme which he had returned to time and time again during his tenure as opposition leader: the need for politicians in government to act with honesty and truthfulness at all times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While championing integrity in public office, the Prime Minister repeatedly accused our Labor government and its leaders of dishonesty while in office. As the Leader of the Opposition, as Mr Howard was then, he said that Labor had let Australians down and that he would return honesty to government. In what was to become one of the most often quoted phrases in this House over the previous 12 months, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We want to assert the very simple principle that truth is absolute, truth is supreme and truth is never disposable in national political life.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>Well, Mr Deputy Speaker, during the 1996 election campaign, the now Prime Minister spoke of the importance of building confidence between the Australian people and their elected representatives&mdash;`Promises were made to be kept, not broken'&mdash;and in quasi&hyphen;religious tones he spoke of the covenant of trust between the people and the politicians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When his opponents or the nation's journalists raised questions or concerns about the coalition's ability to deliver on its promises, our now Prime Minister's decisive statement was that Australians could rest easy in the knowledge that all of his commitments would be kept&mdash;no ifs or buts about it. The deficit, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> whatever its size, said the Prime Minister, would be shouldered before a single one of his promises would be broken. He said, `The public good is not measured in dollars and cents; it is measured in trust.' The rhetoric flowed and the people believed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now, if the nations' newspaper reports are correct, Australia stands on the threshold of the most savage cuts to public expenditure ever carried out. During his first year in government our Prime Minister hopes to shave $4 billion off the nation's deficit, followed by another $4 billion in the next year. If the entrails have been read accurately, 15,000 public servants are to be sacked and government programs will either be cut or have their budgets shaved to such an extent that they will become ineffectual.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) has been quoted as saying that `at this stage' the coalition's promises can be broken, which I think we can read as meaning that all bets are off. It is my belief that, if the coalition succeeds in realising its $8 billion goal in this fashion, the nation will be scarred beyond all recognition. By the end of its term the coalition may well lead a country with its bankbook in the black but it will have shown Australian people that its heart is cloaked in the same absence of colour. While we may face the new millennium, to use the words of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer), as a `leaner' and `meaner' nation, I fear we will find ourselves living in a society which as a result is a much meaner place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not here today to catch the Prime Minister in deceit. I do not wish to make light of the difficult decisions facing him or his government&mdash;matters that we in the Labor party have grappled with for 13 years. Nor am I here to wish him failure, for that would then mean wishing the same on the people of Australia. I am here today to remind the Prime Minister and his government of their duty to themselves and to the people of Australia to govern for all of us and of the covenant of trust which the Prime Minister enjoys with the Australian people and which he is in danger of shattering if he fails to keep his promises.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="129">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to also remind the Prime Minister of his words and of the context in which he made them. I want him and his government to understand that to go ahead with their planned program of cuts and sackings would be the most complete abrogation of the nation's trust by an elected federal government since Federation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of all of his election promises, the one which the member for Bennelong and his coalition stood by with the most firmness and determination was the one that none of his pledges would be broken. How often we heard it! It was a tired old political cliche perhaps, but it was one which the now Prime Minister sought to impress upon the electorate, using his reputation as a supposedly honest and decent politician.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He went one step further to convince Australians of his earnestness. He went on and said that, if in government after election day, rather than break any of his promises he and the coalition would tolerate a budget deficit of whatever size. Now, if what we hear about the government's plans for a wholesale slaughtering of public servants' jobs for the sake of the deficit is true, that would mean a major betrayal of that central election promise, and a betrayal also of his colleagues' promises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Taking up the Prime Minister's line of putting people before the public purse, the member for Ryan, then shadow minister for public administration, now Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore), put out a press release on 26 February in which he said, `There will be no mass sackings of public servants under the coalition.' The member for Ryan could have said, `There will be no mass sackings unless there is a budget deficit&mdash;and then we will cut left, right and centre.' But he did not. His continuing line leading up to the election was that such criticism was part of a Labor smear campaign.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7T4">Mrs CROSIO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. On the same day as that press release that I will not talk about came out, the then Liberal member for Canberra, Mr Brendan Smyth, also released a press release. I do not know whether I am allowed to mention him now as he is no longer a member, but I must thank him for vacating his seat in March to allow me to now sit next to the new Labor member for Namadgi (Ms Ellis). His press release stated that only 2,500 public servants would lose their jobs under a coalition government and that these job losses would be a gentle process. Mr Deputy Speaker, for the benefit of the Chief Government Whip I can read that out as well, in total.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The now Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Fischer, has agreed with his coalition partners, although at first glance he would seem to have completely contradicted them both. Five days before the member for Ryan's press release, the now Deputy Prime Minister was quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Riverina Herald</EMPHASIS> as saying that Australia needed lean and mean government and `if that means 20,000 fewer public servants, so be it'. When questioned about his statement, the now Deputy Prime Minister of this country denied that he had ever used such a figure and said that any reduction in the number of public servants would be through natural attrition. The Deputy Prime Minister was given the chance to come clean on coalition plans for the mass sackings of public servants but he chose to deny any intentions of the kind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two coalition members, one of them now the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia and the other a former coalition member of parliament, stated quite publicly that there would be no mass sackings of public servants. If the Prime Minister takes the axe to the Commonwealth administration in the fashion that many now believe he intends to do, he would therefore also be breaking not only his word but also the promises made by the Deputy Prime Minister and the present Minister for </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA>Industry, Science and Tourism. And remember, Mr Deputy Speaker, that these statements were later supported by the Prime Minister's pledge that all promises would be kept, no matter what the budgetary bottom line, once he was in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There would be a betrayal of trust in other ways. By cutting government expenditure to such an extent, the Prime Minister would be jettisoning a whole raft of commitments and promises made by him to the Australian people, and would savage the trust that he says he wants to consolidate between Australians and their government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look more closely. In that same press release&mdash;and I am sure I am able to mention it because it is on the public record of 26 February&mdash;the member for Ryan on behalf of his leader in the coalition stated that a coalition government would `act to improve public administration as a means of bringing about an improvement in our system of government'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rather than delivering a more efficient and improved public administration, the mass sackings of public servants would lead to irreparable damage in a sector which is essential for the continued success of our parliamentary democracy. The member for Ryan recognised the link between sound government and a sound Public Service in that same press release. He should now also be able to recognise that when public administration suffers so does good government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While savings of a sort are possible in the public sector, the idea that the government is able to get the kinds of savings it wants by cutting indiscriminate chunks away from an already very lean Public Service is ludicrous. Let us look at it this way: if you were to sack every public servant in Canberra you would make savings of only $1.5 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The message is clear: cutting public servants on the scale envisaged by the Prime Minister will not deliver the savings he feels are necessary. So where can he and his government hope to cut the remaining $6.5 billion? I shudder to think. To slash the Public Service to the extent that the government is said to be planning would be to compromise all the things that the member for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="131"> Ryan promised the coalition stood for. He spoke then of a service which could give `professional advice', of a more `efficient and professional sector'. He said that the coalition recognised the needs of `the public and of the service'. Quite obviously, any such professionalism would be jeopardised by the mass sackings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth is that the Australian Public Service has been reduced by 18 per cent over the last seven to eight years as a result of efficiency demands placed on that sector by the previous Labor government. There is simply nothing more left there to cut. If much more goes, we will all suffer with it. If the government chooses to target the Public Service in this fashion it will be sending a powerful message to the rest of Australia&mdash;that the sector is full of deadwood. It would be perpetuating the reprehensible notion that public servants spend their days making cups of tea and eating Iced VoVos, and because of that they can be got rid of quickly. Regarding the Public Service in such a fashion is an insult to the legacy of such great Australians as Nugget Coombs and Sir Robert Garran. If the government continues in this vein it can consider itself a contributor to the destruction of the service's reputation and, more importantly, its morale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are the government's commitments to rural Australia? During the election campaign, the coalition promised Australians living in rural areas that their government would ensure people have fair and equitable access to housing, health, education, communications, new technology and government services. Do they seriously think that carving $8 billion worth of savings from the public purse will help deliver such benefits to rural Australia, benefits they have promised to pass on and protect? Of course they do not, because cuts on that scale would devastate rural Australia. That is something which I am sure my honourable friends in the National Party recognise and are certainly getting increasingly nervous about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rather than ensuring equal access to government services, the coalition will facilitate the widespread deterioration of services to pensioners, universities, schools and all <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> organisations in rural Australia where Commonwealth budget support is granted. Only 15 per cent of the people employed by the Commonwealth are employed in Canberra. In fact, if my memory serves me correctly, the Commonwealth employs twice as many people in New South Wales as it employs in Canberra. When you consider the small businesses&mdash;the sandwich shops, the small grocery stores&mdash;in the country towns and rural centres who depend on the patronage of these people whom the government seems hell&hyphen;bent on discarding, it truly begins to beggar the imagination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to go further on this point. During the election campaign, our Prime Minister often spoke of the coalition's distress at the number of Australia's unemployed. He and the members of the coalition called it a national disgrace. When the then Leader of the Opposition's shadow minister for employment, Dr David Kemp, launched the coalition's employment policy he said, `We are promising to create many jobs, many more real jobs, than Labor.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having expressed their indignation at unemployment levels and their commitment to reducing such levels when their turn came around, could the same people and the same party now make significant contributions to them and then say that they have kept their promise to reduce unemployment? I would think not. Would adding some 15,000 public servants to the queue in the Department of Social Security correspond with the promise by Dr Kemp and our Prime Minister to reach full employment in Australia? It certainly does not look like it to me. It is, in fact, horrendously inconsistent with such statements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And what of the pledges by the Prime Minister on the environment? Since he launched the coalition's environment policy early in the election campaign, he has endeavoured to portray himself as a convert to the environmental cause. Apart from links with the sale of Telstra, his environmental policy and his personal statements were met warmly by our nation's environmental groups. He, in turn, convinced a number of Australians of his `pure' environmental intentions.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="132">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In one of his first press releases of the campaign, the then Leader of the Opposition stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Coalition Government will act decisively to preserve Australia's natural heritage and its great productivity potential for future generations. A Coalition Government will achieve real action on environmental protection.</PARA>
<PARA>Real action indeed! During the coalition's first seven weeks in office, Australians have learnt that this Prime Minister is giving serious consideration to scrapping the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency. Some say that his serious consideration has actually developed into a firm intention. In fact, it has been reported that the EPA staff have now been given verbal notification that their agency would be abolished, saving $20 million and shutting down 150 workers, the majority of whom are based in Canberra. The savings to the government are clear&mdash;but what of the cost to Australia as a whole?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Environment Protection Agency, established by the Labor government in August 1991, oversees 15 federal acts and was pivotal in the previous government's move to develop national environmental standards related to water quality, air quality, fuel standards, control of hazardous waste and pollution. The EPA polices a number of environmental standards that Australia is committed to via international agreement, such as those for ozone protection, wetlands preservation, greenhouse emissions and the transportation of hazardous waste&mdash;a role that the state agencies certainly cannot mirror. Let us not forget that the EPA is responsible for the carrying out of environmental impact statements for the Commonwealth. It is the EPA that would conduct an environmental study on the impact of opening Jabiluka, the uranium mine in the pristine wilderness of Kakadu. Of immediate interest also to my own constituents, the EPA is responsible for conducting a thorough environmental impact statement on the proposed Badgerys Creek airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In light of his commitments on the environment given during the election campaign, does the Prime Minister now honestly think that Australians will view the scrapping of the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> EPA as a sign of a government living up to its promise of achieving real action on environmental protection? It would be an insult for him to even pretend that he does.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not that the government will admit to breaking its word should it choose to cut the agency. You can be sure that the government will talk of the evils of duplicating federal and state services. It will say that the state EPA bureaus will be able to take on more responsibilities in order to match the duties of the current Commonwealth agency. Yet we all know that each state and each state government has an agenda of its own. For instance, we all know that the Northern Territory government has long been a supporter of opening up Kakadu to further mining development. It, like any other state or territory government, will act in its own revenue raising interests and not those of other Australians who desire world renowned wilderness areas such as Kakadu to remain as untouched and unspoilt as they presently are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ramifications of the loss of the Commonwealth EPA are significant&mdash;not only now but for Australians of the future&mdash;and not one of them corresponds with the Prime Minister's firm vows and promises on protecting the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The covenant of trust will be broken in further ways. I refer, of course, to the coalition's commitment to justice. In February, when the then shadow Attorney&hyphen;General, Senator Vanstone, released the justice policy for the coalition, it was trumpeted as the most comprehensive law and justice policy ever released by an opposition. Yet one of the main organs of justice of the Commonwealth government, the office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman, has been slated by the Howard coalition for cuts of something like $1.5 million&mdash;a 30 per cent cut to its present operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How does such a move meet the coalition's pre&hyphen;election promise to `redress the inability of Australians' to access justice? It does not. Such a move would be in complete conflict with such an objective. The Commonwealth Ombudsman investigates complaints concerning the bureaucracies associated with the federal government. The office impartially <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="133"> investigates whether people have been treated fairly by such diverse departments as the Australian Taxation Office, the Department of Social Security and the Australian Federal Police, and it audits the use of phone taps. Yet it will be another of the departments which this coalition government will slash from the hips. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I address the parliament today with some mixed reflections in my mind. I am certainly proud and honoured to represent the people of Macarthur and I sincerely thank them for both the opportunity and the responsibility that they have given me. I assure them that my priority at all times will be to represent their concerns and to do my best to progress their hopes and their aspirations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is difficult, however, not to reflect upon the past year and the twists and turns that my political career has taken. Fifty&hyphen;two per cent of the people of New South Wales voted for the coalition in March of last year and it is only human to feel disappointment when government is denied to the majority of the people. Thankfully, my faith in democracy was restored on March 2 this year when the expressed wish of the people of Australia brought about a change in the governance of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that the Labor Party in New South Wales stole government, with deceitful promises, such as removing tolls, that they had no intention of keeping. Those broken promises, more than any other factor, enticed me to continue to serve my community, albeit in another forum. I am grateful for the encouragement given to me by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the state president of the Liberal Party, Bill Heffernan, and the state director, Tony Nutt. I also acknowledge the influence of my former colleagues in the New South Wales parliament, particularly Kerry Chikarovski and John Hannaford. I acknowledge the numerous friends and members of the Liberal Party who continue to express their confidence and faith in my ability to contribute to public life and to contribute to my community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also thank the honourable Charlie Lyn for his unselfish decision to step aside to allow me to be the Liberal candidate for Macarthur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am one of over 50 new members elected to the 38th Parliament. So many individuals will have a marked impact on the character of this parliament as the years unfold. I am proud to be one of 39 new coalition members on the government benches. I welcome and I applaud the election of 18 women, almost half the number of new government members.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="134">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition has done more to promote the cause of women in politics than did all the endless and apparently futile machinations of the Labor Party in the corridors of the Hobart Wrest Point Casino. The gender imbalance in politics has been addressed in the Liberal Party through the simple mechanism of allowing those with talent, regardless of their gender, to be recognised as the best candidate for the party. The Labor Party's approach of quotas&mdash;treating its women as just another faction&mdash;has been, and will be, a failure. I will continue to support and recognise the talent and contribution that so many women are making, and will make, to the Liberal Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My first exposure to politics was in the seat of Macarthur during the 1972 federal election campaign. The first member for Macarthur, Jeff Bate, was not endorsed by the Liberal Party&mdash;after representing the party as the member for some 23 years. He ran as an Independent and, through the influence of some friends, I found myself as one of his campaign supporters. I later realised the wisdom of the Liberal Party's preselectors when I took him on a pub crawl through Camden. He borrowed money from me before each of the four hotels. He told me that it would look bad in front of the customers if he didn't take his turn with the shout.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second member for Macarthur, John Kerin, who served this parliament with distinction, won that election. By the time the 1975 campaign came around I was a member of the Liberal Party working tirelessly for the Liberal candidate, Michael Baume. I joined the Liberal Party in 1974 because I could no longer ignore the extravagances of the Whitlam government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today, Gough Whitlam is delightful social company. But he presided over a Labor government that did more than any other person in my lifetime to derail this country's progress. Gough Whitlam created the welfare state. He destroyed business incentive and he introduced the dependency culture for the first time in this nation's history. It puzzles me today that the Labor Party perpetuates the mythical status of greatness on Gough <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Whitlam as a leader of our country when he does not deserve it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nor will the Australian people thank the former Prime Minister, Paul Keating. The Howard government now has the difficult task of rectifying the waste and mismanagement of recent years&mdash;and the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) is as guilty as anyone for the present sorry state of the nation's finances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Michael Baume became the third member for Macarthur in 1975. I have enjoyed an unbroken association with Michael since that campaign. Macarthur will always be close to his heart. Over the past 11 years, as a senator, he has continued his association with the Macarthur community and I wish him well in the next phase of his career.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are four current members of this parliament who have represented the seat of Macarthur: the current members for Cunningham (Mr Martin) and Throsby (Mr Hollis), Senator Baume, and now me. I pay tribute to the Labor members, including Chris Haviland who was unceremoniously dumped by his party prior to the last election. Each of them would have drawn enormous personal satisfaction from the diversity of the electorate and the good people who reside within it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst this is my maiden speech in the federal parliament, it is not&mdash;as many would be aware&mdash;my first speech as a parliamentarian. I have had the honour of serving as a member of Australia's oldest parliament, in New South Wales, since 1984, including seven years in cabinet and three years as the Premier of my state. My maiden speech in that parliament as the newly elected member for Camden was made on a cold August night to a near empty chamber in Macquarie Street. I was, at that time, a member of the opposition. I subsequently won the seat of Southern Highlands in 1988 and my new federal seat of Macarthur incorporates about 90 per cent of those areas I represented as a state member. I can claim, therefore, a continuous parliamentary representation of the same district, and many of the same constituents, since 1984.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I made my maiden speech in 1984 my close friend and long&hyphen;time campaign <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="135"> director Doug Travers was present. Until February of this year, Doug was my greatest supporter and, at times, my harshest critic. He was, however, always objective and constructive. Tragically, a malignant tumour drained his life away earlier this year. Within a short time of the announcement of the federal election, he slipped quietly away in the Mater Hospice for the Dying in Newcastle. He continued to assure me, until he could no longer speak, that he intended to get better and to campaign with me once more. In the end, it was almost as if he wanted to get out of the road so that he did not disrupt the campaign when it became a little more intense. I shall never forget his years of friendship and loyal support, and his wife, Joy, will always be a special friend of our family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The electorate of Macarthur contains a number of areas that, in many ways, are a microcosm of Australia itself. There are those who are first home buyers; there are those who are seeking to establish for themselves and their families&mdash;in many cases, their young families&mdash;a way of life that is better for all of them. It is interesting to note that, in the success we achieved at the last election, so many of those that changed their votes to vote Liberal in the seat of Macarthur came from the areas that might otherwise have been recognised as Labor heartland. And they came to the Liberal Party in the manner in which they voted because they had been deserted by Labor. They were offered no hope; they were offered no understanding of what it meant to get ahead in terms of the progress they wanted for themselves and their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To achieve what we achieved at that time required an enormous team of supporters, including those members of the branches in the Liberal Party. And perhaps no&hyphen;one enjoyed the success of the Liberal Party in Macarthur more than the Camden branch president, David Funnell. I succeeded David as the president of the Camden branch in 1976. He has worked for the Liberal Party in every campaign, state and federal, for 25 years. He also experienced many disappointments in the federal campaigns until this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">David led a willing team of supporters throughout the campaign and I am grateful to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Debbie Dewbery, Charlotte Sheehan, Merle Kelly, Chris Neale, Andrew Ethell, the volunteers in the campaign rooms and the army of supporters who turned out on election day. I particularly want to mention Michael Ball, Max Tegel, Marcus Blackmore, Chris Brown and some generous supporters who contributed to the fundraising for my campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The hard work of all of them helped to achieve a remarkable swing&mdash;the largest successful swing, I am pleased to say&mdash;in New South Wales. The areas in the electorate where the swing to the Liberal Party was greatest might previously have been regarded as Labor heartland and they came to the Liberal Party at this election because Labor had deserted them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are areas in my electorate, including the southern part around Mittagong and Bowral, that have genuine poverty. There is family dysfunction and there is a need for young people to leave their homes in search of work. The task ahead of me is to assist those communities to maintain their independence as a community, working, in government, on policies that provide the work, recreation and infrastructure that all self&hyphen;supporting communities deserve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition government was given an opportunity because we offered the people of Australia support for families and a recognition that the family is the best support unit capable of delivering a satisfying life. I know that in the months and years ahead this will be a pivotal part of government programs. I have never questioned what makes up a family unit, other than to say it is a support unit, and it has certainly been the cornerstone of my life. In recent weeks, I have been pleased to retreat to my family to regain my sanity from the burdens of grappling with the mess left by my portfolio predecessor, the now Leader of the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank my wife, Colleen, for her constancy and her love, and my children who, amongst other things, have taught me to take my responsibilities seriously, but never myself. I also want to acknowledge on this occasion my mother, Anne, who is the most unselfish person I have ever known, and also my father, who gave, within our family unit, a long <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="136"> day's work every day. Sadly, he is not very mobile these days, but he is well cared for by the Sisters of St Joseph at St Anne's Nursing Home at Hunters Hill in Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My parents were Irish immigrants and between them they had 26 brothers and sisters. They left their families and the poverty and helplessness inflicted on them by the Great Depression in the late 1930s to create a better life for themselves and the children they hoped to have. They taught me to share, to be generous, to contribute to others, to work hard and to recognise God's role and the value of His support in all that we do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They also taught me to think for myself and that is why I am a member of the Liberal Party. I have never voted Labor, as some scribes have written. The Liberal Party stands for all Australians, not any vested interest group such as the unions, and it supports reward for effort. Nothing is more Australian.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday, on the occasion of delivering his address to parliament, the Governor&hyphen;General indicated the commitment of this government to grappling with the prospective budget deficit of $8 billion. I concur with His Excellency's observations of the intent of this government to tackle our inheritance from the Labor administration through prudent and responsible management of the national budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am honoured to have the opportunity to serve as a member of cabinet in Prime Minister John Howard's first government and I look forward to working with my colleagues in cabinet to fulfil the aspirations of all Australians, regardless of their country of birth or the colour of their skin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people of Macarthur and all Australians seek reward for their hard work and initiative. They aspire to an affordable home and a future for their children and they want to look forward to a better standard of living. I have full confidence that a coalition government will make significant progress in meeting these aspirations for the people of Macarthur and beyond.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is much to be done in the suburbs, the towns and the villages of Macarthur. My great disappointment is that the government's <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> first task must be to repair the damage caused by an uncaring and incompetent Labor government before we can deliver progress at a rate that we would wish for the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have never ceased, however, to admire the fortitude and generosity of the communities I have represented, in the giving of their time and skills to voluntary organisations. As we approach a new millennium there is a confidence and goodwill that I have not experienced since my younger days. Governments will never deliver what all might want, but if we can work in partnership with the voluntary groups and harness the skills and expertise of our communities, and if we can give greater opportunities to these groups of individuals, much can be achieved in the final years of this century that will make each of our communities better places. We must give opportunities to our young and look after our aged, who have done so much for us in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my initial maiden speech I spoke of the need to promote and facilitate small business as a job creator. I spoke of the significant contribution the coal industry could make to my electorate and the nation's exports. I also spoke of the need for proper infrastructure for the communities I represented. Those same issues exist today. More needs to be done to make better communities in Rosemeadow, Warragamba, Thirlmere, Oakdale and Hilltop and the surrounding towns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The horticulturalists, tradesmen and service industries are small businesses, and the local miners and cement workers can, and do, contribute to our nation's wealth. I shall take a special interest in benefits for our families and facilities for our aging&mdash;whether it be at the Queen Victoria Hospital at Picton or anywhere else in Macarthur&mdash;and the enhancement of small business through a regulatory regime that gives incentives for Australians to have a go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I pay tribute to the many colleagues who helped me in the  past to develop my political skills, whatever they might be. I was fortunate to have the benefit of counsel and advice from two very good state leaders&mdash;Nick Greiner in the area of management and economics and Wal Murray on how to be <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="137"> practical, objective and solid in what you believe in. I had the loyalty and support of many cabinet colleagues, one of whom is in the chamber today, the honourable member for Page (Mr Causley), and I also had the understanding and knowledge of teamwork installed in me by many of those people. I was taught to stand up for what was right, even if it was unpopular. I had a great team of advisers, including the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey), in my office over those past three years in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Liberal Party has given me a chance to work for my family, my neighbours, my community and my state. The Liberal Party now gives me a chance to work for my country. I thank my long&hyphen;time conference president, Roger Warner, and secretary, Margaret Hogg, for always being there, and the hundreds of volunteers in the branches who share my beliefs in the Liberal Party philosophy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am excited about the future. We approach the centenary of Federation and we will host the biggest peace&hyphen;time event in the world's history, the Olympic Games. We must harness the enthusiasm and skills that Australians have in vast  quantities. The government has an opportunity and a responsibility to progress our nation, to take a prominent role in our region but, more importantly, to progress the individual lives of all Australians so we may all play satisfying, rewarding and fulfilling roles in one Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My parents instilled in me the virtues of compassion and respect for others. I will do my best to translate those virtues into a meaningful gain for the people of Macarthur and the people all around Australia. I thank the House for the courtesies and forbearance extended to me during this address.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I join with other members of the House in conveying congratulations to you, the member for Casey (Mr Halverson) and the member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) on your election to these important presiding offices within the parliament. I wish you well in the execution of your tasks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note the contents of the speech by the new member for Macarthur (Mr Fahey). It was <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> quite a provocative speech, launching strong personal attacks on the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), former Prime Minister Mr Keating and even one of my predecessors, the great man himself, Gough Whitlam. What are we to make of those comments? It is true, as the member for Macarthur outlined, that Gough Whitlam established the modern welfare state in Australia. Can the House now conclude that the new member for Macarthur, as Minister for Finance, has set himself the task of dismantling that welfare state, leaving Australia with an American&hyphen;style system where there is no public housing and people live and sleep on the streets, and where there are no adequate long&hyphen;term transfer payments and social security and people beg on the streets?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought, according to Australian values of egalitarianism and inclusiveness, that the people of this nation would have much to be thankful for in the record of Gough Whitlam and much to be concerned about in the impending cuts launched by the new member for Macarthur in his capacity as Minister for Finance.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on this side of the House will be monitoring the new member's progress.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is always interesting to note transformations. We heard yesterday of the quite remarkable transformation of the new Speaker. One day he was the Chief Opposition Whip, the next day a so&hyphen;called independent Speaker; one day winning 41 hard&hyphen;earned ballots in the Liberal party room, knocking Ironbar and the member for New England (Mr Sinclair) out of the race&mdash;a real knock `em down, lay `em flat sort of party battle&mdash;the next day an independent Speaker of the House of Representatives. These ironies extend to the member for Macarthur, the new Minister for Finance: one day guarding the state finances in New South Wales, guarding state grants against Commonwealth attacks, making public statements about how none of these state grants should be touched; the next day arriving in this place as the head man on the razor gang, to cut away those state grants and programs in education, health and housing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These remarkable transformations really amaze the opposition. We will be holding not <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="138"> only the new Speaker but also the new member for Macarthur, the finance minister, accountable because they cannot have it both ways. A member cannot be a card-carrying member of the Liberal Party&mdash;the new Speaker has publicly said he will remain as that&mdash;and yet say he is independent. He is no more independent than I am, just as the new member for Macarthur is no more able to legitimately cut away at the finances of the Commonwealth. Given his very strong public record as Premier of New South Wales, he cannot say that none of those outlays, none of those grants, to the states in education, health and housing can possibly be touched without massive social dislocation and inequity in our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After 13 years many Australians have been keen to judge the character of this new government. We can tell a lot about a new government from its early decisions, its priorities, its concerns, its political strategy. What have Australians found in this new Howard-Fischer government? What sorts of conclusions are they now drawing? I think they are finding a mean streak, a nasty streak. They are finding a determination to set Australian against Australian by fanning bigotry, fanning prejudice, in our society.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="K26">Mr LATHAM</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And may well the Chief Government Whip interject. A government, as he knows full well, has a range of choices upon its election. This new government could have announced, for instance, in its first bundle of decisions major changes to Australia's health structures, the rejuvenation of Australia's education system, ambitious plans following Brian Howe's outstanding work for a revolution in the way in which we provide public housing in this country, and policies that go to the heart of better government, better structures and better performance by the public sector. But the government did not announce any of those things. It pushed the buttons on the keyboard of Australian public life to fan prejudice, to fan bigotry. I will provide some examples.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The government pushed buttons in its deliberate strategy relating to welfare provi sion. I thought the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) was trying to do Ray Martin and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Current Affair</EMPHASIS> out of job by saying that she would be issuing press releases to publicly expose welfare cheats. It was shades, a reminder, of medieval England: they would be out there in the stocks and we would all go out and throw tomatoes at them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the member for Wentworth (Mr Andrew Thomson), who is at the table, applauds this sort of behaviour by a minister of the Crown. It is quite remarkable because she was really saying that she was going to fan the idea that Australians who do not earn welfare should be set against those who do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And this was for what? What was her stunning public policy solution to this problem? She announced she would issue those press releases and one extra telephone line by which people could ring up. That probably adds to scores of telephone lines in the Department of Social Security whereby concerned Australians can report instances of welfare abuse. For no major change in the structure of government, no answers and no solutions that provide better government, she was willing to fan those prejudices in our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was followed by the announcement for a relatively minor gain in the budget by placing new restrictions on migrants and their eligibility for social security payments. It is not a big saving but it sets the 78 per cent of Australians who were born here against the 22 per cent of Australians who were born overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next announcement concerned ATSIC. Again, there was no major restructuring of Aboriginal affairs and no formulation for better government and better delivery of programs for Aboriginal people. The announcement was that ATSIC would have one extra auditor&mdash;one extra auditor for an organisation which is audited more thoroughly than any other part of the public sector in this nation. What is the purpose of it? It is a deliberate strategy to set the two per cent of Australians of Aboriginal heritage against the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="139"> 98 per cent of Australians who are non-Aboriginal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new government's next decision was the old stock&hyphen;in&hyphen;trade of tory governments: kick the public servants, kick the public sector. This is a strategy designed to set the 20 per cent of Australians employed in the public sector against the 80 per cent of Australians employed in the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally in this gang of five decisions came the government's industrial relations reform. The only purpose of this legislation is to set the 65 per cent of Australians who do not belong to unions against the 35 per cent who do, to drive unions out of the workplace and to set Australians against Australians in the workplaces of this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So much for `All of us'. This is a government for some. This is a government for a certain part of Australian society set against the minority. It is a government that governs for a majority and kicks the minority. It does this under the cloak of so-called political correctness. We will hear about this so-called political correctness today and throughout the next fortnight from many members speaking for the first time in the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Political correctness is of course code for saying that governments in this country care too much about minority interests&mdash;minority interests being the interests of those who are disadvantaged. This is a group of members who think the role of government is to govern not for all of us, not for all Australians, but for a majority of Australians who are advantaged and to govern against the interests, to deliberately kick the interests, of a minority of Australians who are disadvantaged. This is a government that is for 70 per cent against 30 per cent, for 98 per cent against two per cent, for 65 per cent against 35 per cent. It is not a government for all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over time the Australian people will understand these deliberate political strategies. They will understand the way in which the coalition is fanning the fires of prejudice and bigotry in Australia. Like the little boy who lights a fire and sits on the hill to watch the forest burn down, the government is letting these views run on talkback radio and redneck parts <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the community as a deliberate, shameful political strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having been a member of this House for about two years, I can recall how the now Prime Minister, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), told us that we could not debate the republic because it was divisive. We could not debate the republic because it might set Australian against Australian, but we can debate Aboriginal affairs, welfare abuse, migration and the public sector, and we can kick some public servants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the John Howard who adopted as his mantra in Australian politics that `the things that unite us are more important than the things that divide us'. I challenge members on the opposite side, members of the government, particularly those making their first speeches, to answer this question: what is it that unites Australia under a Howard government? What is it that has come from the first two months of its administration that unites Australians?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no unity between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australia because of the decisions of this government. There is no unity between the private sector and the public sector, no unity between Australians born here and those born overseas, and no unity between Australians who belong to trade unions and those who do not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a government which has deliberately set Australian against Australian. This is the Thatcherite strategy of thinking&mdash;that you can govern for a majority, in her case the south of England, against the interests of a minority, in her case the north. This is a government which has set about a political strategy of dividing the nation and it is doing it for a lowbrow, low&hyphen;grade political purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This really is the lowest common denominator in Australian public life and it teaches a pretty important lesson. It is always so much harder in public life to encourage people to do good things&mdash;to encourage people to actually care about the needy and to encourage people to take a broader view of what we can achieve as a society and as a nation. It is so much harder on our side of politics, the Labor side of politics, when we take on the task of trying to encourage people <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="140"> to think fairly and compassionately about their fellow Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is so much easier on the conservative, reactionary side of politics to light the fire, to fan it away and to get people thinking the worst of each other. So we take the high road on this side of the House and we are very glad of that because, at the end of the day, when you look at the social fabric and at the sorts of emotions that run through the community, you see that you are always out there doing good by encouraging people to think well of others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing we will hear in these first speeches, and it is an ideology across the government benches, is this concept of the crowding out thesis&mdash;that somehow the public sector is crowding out small business in Australia and that somehow the welfare state is crowding out civil institutions. I see one of the new members at the back nodding. He should understand that half of the small businesses in Australia are sole traders. Of the 800,000 small businesses in Australia, 400,000 are sole traders. From ABS data, they would have been known 10 years ago as employees&mdash;carpenters, tradesmen and computer technologists working for companies but who have now gone out to form their own businesses and are working by themselves for themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How can supply&hyphen;side solutions do anything for their business? How can an unfair dismissal act do anything for the 400,000 small businesses in Australia that involve one person? Is this the idea that you have: you can generate employment by making it easier for people to sack themselves? This is the absurdity of what the government is suggesting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no crowding out of small business by the public sector, because for most small businesses in Australia their success is a function of spending power. I can walk through the main street of Campbelltown in my electorate and hear nobody complaining about the award system, or about the need for micro reforms or about the supply side.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The function and success of small business is a function of the demand side&mdash;how much people spend. Small businesses rely on ex penditure. In many parts of Australia, including Campbelltown, they rely on public expenditure. If that public expenditure is removed from the local economy, there is no private expenditure to take its place. It is self-evident that this government's strategy of cutting away at the public sector, disadvantaging already depressed regional economies by taking away those public resources, will add to unemployment. It will make the task of small business so much harder.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an easy way to understand this, and it relates to the Prime Minister's background. In the election campaign he said that he was keen on small business, because that is his family background. He was a bowser boy in inner Sydney. But he does not understand that the success of that business depended on the volume of petrol purchased. The success of that business depended on the demand for petrol and not on the supply&hyphen;side considerations for which he now has a fetish as Prime Minister. So most small businesses in Australia rely much more on spending power in the community than they do on any of the supply&hyphen;side micro reforms this government has on its agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the welfare system, is the government really suggesting that winding back programs provokes some flood of private charity into the community? Is that the crowding out thesis that provokes some flood of new civil and civic institutions to take the place of government?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Government is nothing more than an expression of the collective will. It is a determination of citizens to have institutions which act in the collective interest&mdash;to raise revenue collectively and to provide programs collectively that individuals, particularly disadvantaged individuals, cannot provide for themselves. There is no crowding out thesis for small business or with regard to the welfare state in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government throughout its term will do great damage to the Australian economy, because it has a very inappropriate set of policies in place. It has living standard initiatives based on $10 billion worth of cuts to the social wage&mdash;the $8 billion outlined by the Treasurer after the election plus the $2 billion <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="141"> per annum outlined during the election campaign. There will be more labour market deregulation, where the weak are set against the strong in the workplace, and of course there will be higher interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a high interest rate government because it has abolished the accord. It has thrown wages policy out the window, and for no good reason. With the globalisation of capital, active fiscal policy is limited by spill&hyphen;over effects on the external account and monetary policy is under the influence of convergence with the dynamic nature of capital movements between nations. You will find that most monetary policy is converging around some basic fundamentals. So one of the great expressions of national sovereignty and autonomous policy for the macro economy is wages policy. This government has decided to abandon the one thing a nation can keep within its power to distinctly influence economic outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does not understand the basis of industrial relations. IR reform is not just a micro reform issue&mdash;extra productivity in the workplace&mdash;but also a macro&hyphen;economic issue, because it is the best way of controlling wage and inflation outcomes. Unions are the only collective institution in the economy which can possibly keep those outcomes within the inflation goals of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Individuals will not do it. No individual is going to listen to John Howard or Peter Costello saying, `You should turn down wage bargains you can achieve in the market.' That person will be thinking, `If I do that, and other people pursue aggressive wage bargains, I still have to pay the increase in interest rates as a product of wage based inflation.' So only unions as a collective institution in the workplace can provide the macro wages policy restraint and discipline. That of course was the key feature of the accord.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Without the accord, the first thing you are left with is huff and puff. You just have to try to lecture the public into taking a lower level of wages to what the market would pay. The second thing you are left with is an excessive use of monetary policy. If you cannot keep wages and inflation in check with wages policy, it follows that government and the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Reserve Bank need to use pre-emptive monetary policy. There has to be a greater and an earlier use of interest rates. And that is what we are seeing. Do not just take it from me. The independent economic forecasting group, Syntec, recently stated in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Gareth Evans, the shadow Treasurer, is right in saying now that under a Labor government falls in official interest rates would be occurring.</PARA>
<PARA>Under a Labor government with the accord in place, with a macro wages policy in place, Australia would now have a cut in interest rates. We have not had that cut because this government have foolishly thrown wages policy and the accord out the window. It is well and good for the Treasurer to talk about the current account deficit as a brake on economic growth. He is now two&hyphen;brake Costello. There is the brake he has acknowledged from the current account deficit, and the extra brake that he has placed on the Australian economy by abandoning wages policy. There is an extra brake on the Australian economy by virtue of higher interest rates&mdash;a restraint on growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the former government, after the last upswing in the business cycle Australia led the world in growth. Under the new government, with higher interest rates, without the sort of cut that would have been achieved under the accord, we are going to fall off the back of international growth. We are going to fall down the OECD growth table, all because of this government's misguided economic strategies. It is a great shame that the government has chosen in its first days to turn a majority of Australians against a minority; to turn Australian against Australian. It is a great shame indeed that on the economic policy front they have labelled themselves a high interest rate, low growth government with falling living standards for the average Australian family.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Through the course of my address I would like to tell honourable members a little about me and what I hope to contribute to and achieve during my time here. I would also like to outline a number of important matters for the record so that in years to come I can easily refer back to them. I am one of the 53 new parliamentarians, and I share the concern of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and many people in my electorate about how we conduct ourselves in this place. Many people tell me that they want to see a greater deal of decorum and more of a fair go for all than has been the case in recent parliaments. People's present perception of this place is a burden we can all discard through performance. I imagine, Mr Deputy Speaker, you also realise that with so many new members&mdash;over one&hyphen;third of us&mdash;there will never be a better time to forge some new habits and break some old ones. I am sure that all honourable members also agree. My constituents expect good conduct. I am their representative here, and I will do my utmost to justify their support in me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moreton has been my home for over 25 years, and four generations of my family live locally. I believe I am the only ex-student of Runcorn State Primary, of MacGregor State High and of Griffith University&mdash;all within my electorate&mdash;to have been elected to this place. It is certainly a great honour to be the first from each of those schools and the local university, and to represent them here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I owe my election largely to the impact which two people have had on the people of Moreton. One is our Prime Minister, a man held in high regard in the Moreton electorate, and the other person is the previous Prime Minister. The election result certainly exceeded the expectations of the experts, but it did <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reflect the views of most local people I met. I knocked on the doors of over 13,000 homes for over 12 months and the depth of feeling amongst so many people, including the life&hyphen;long Labor voters whom I met along the way, was simply that Keating and Labor had to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My campaign was a very local effort, and my focus will remain very Moreton-centric. The people of Moreton rightly expect and will receive from me, both in the parliament and through departmental and ministerial channels, solid representation. The people of Moreton want this government to get the basic things right first: the family, small business, the creation of real jobs&mdash;all items which Labor left off its agenda. Labor said there was simply nothing wrong. Labor said families were well looked after and small business was booming. In Labor's mind&hyphen;set there were plenty of jobs, and increasing crime was just one of those things. Labor ignored local road and infrastructure problems, overcrowding in classrooms and increasing red tape affecting everyday people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Each of these very real issues, ignored by Labor, all relate to individuals&mdash;people. Labor had forgotten about real people. That is why it lost the last election. I believe we must ensure that individuals recognise their responsibilities, achieve and contribute to their personal life and, by it, to their community while ensuring the protection of those less able. The great Liberal, and second Prime Minister of Australia, Alfred Deakin, set out his views 90 years ago in a major speech in 1906 on the role of government. What Deakin said of the Liberal Party then is just as true today. He said that the party:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . has sought social justice by trusting the people and developing the powers of self-government.</PARA>
<PARA>Deakin also tempered this testimony of belief in individuals with this observation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Liberal Party does not fear to use the social powers and authorities, which legislation and administration present . . .</PARA>
<PARA>He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The action of the state is justified by the results.</PARA>
<PARA>Those words of 90 years ago set clearly the case against the previous government. The results of the actions taken by Labor over 13 <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="143"> years just did not sustain them. Labor lost the election based on its record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor policies enforced bland, compulsory, politically correct behaviour. Traditional families were devalued. Labor laws allowed and financed children to simply leave home when they chose, and parents were told that they could not force their children to obey their authority. Is it any wonder that crime increased under Labor? Labor failed small business, the young, the hundreds of thousands wanting a job and just as many more who gave up looking for one. Labor's intimidation and control of the lives and finances of independent and pension retirees and war veterans through complex and restrictive laws were an absolute disgrace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor signed away many of our rights and obligations as individuals to foreign authority and international scrutiny. Their cuts in defence spending made our national security vulnerable. Labor created a nation in which many people turned to government at every obstacle. You could easily say they turned the social security safety net into a hammock.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's idea of multiculturalism was based on segmenting the community, not bringing it together. Unlike Labor, I believe Australians of all backgrounds and beliefs can unite by emphasising the similarities, not highlighting the differences. Labor's way needed legislation to force conformity and adherence. Labor's approach caused great resentment among many Australians. I believe the Howard government will build a better future for all Australians and will bring us all closer together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last Friday evening, 250 members of my local community gathered to form the Lions Club of Brisbane&hyphen;Chinese. This is the third such club in Australia and I was honoured to attend and extend good wishes on behalf of both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock). The formation of this club is very well supported in my electorate and will allow these good local citizens to continue to build bridges in the broader community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Asian migrants in Moreton are those who believe strongly in the family and in individual enterprise. They chose Australia as their <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> new home and as a place to invest because it promised so much&mdash;but like the broader community, they knew Labor was taking them nowhere fast.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As His Excellency outlined yesterday, there is much work to be done in this 38th Parliament. We have to reverse the trend Labor created where the system of the state became more important than the outcomes. Sustaining the system and protecting the stakeholders in the system became the driving force for decision making under Labor rather than ensuring real positive outcomes for the people we are all elected to serve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that vein, I promise the people of my electorate that I want to build an effective partnership with them. My own experience and viewpoint is not the only one to prevail in my deliberations in this place; rather, I will continue to actively seek and consider the broad viewpoint of my constituents. My role is clearly as their representative in this place and I will act accordingly in attempting to influence good and sensible outcomes from the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a new member in this place, my prevailing enthusiasm is tempered and sobered by the great responsibility which we all share. The changes we must realise which everyday Australians expect us to deliver are important. Australians want early signposts from the new government that action is taking place. Australians of all backgrounds and ages want to be able to plan for the future and work to meet their goals with certainty. They do not want a repeat of the Labor years where government constantly changed rules and conditions. As honourable members would know, superannuation laws are the classic example.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australians who invest in productive assets and infrastructure want to be rewarded, not penalised like self&hyphen;funded retirees and small business people were during the Labor years. Most of all, Australians expect this government to restore reward for individual effort. Australia must become again, as the great Liberal Sir Robert Menzies put it in his famous `forgotten people' broadcast of 1942:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a community of people whose motto shall be to strive, to seek, to find and not to yield. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="144"> </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, Australians rightly expect some government support for individual endeavour. It is a legitimate role of government to provide the infrastructure for business and individuals to use in the pursuit of their goals. In a land as broad and as sparsely populated as ours, this has been a fact since 1788.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Menzies and other Liberal prime ministers all recognised a positive role for the state to ensure equality of opportunity for all. Liberals have always ensured that those who would be otherwise disadvantaged are afforded a dignified and just role in our society. After all, the great social reforms show that we as a nation are not into the selfish, strict laissez&hyphen;faire style where some miss out and social obligations are ignored.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As representatives of the people, we have to ensure that there are the right results from our actions here, while also trying to simplify and decrease the rules and regulations affecting and restricting the freedom of individual Australians. Mr Deputy Speaker, you no doubt gather that I am not a rabid deregulationist. I believe that market forces alone have led over time to monopolies in many industries, which is often against the public good.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My personal professional experience proves to me how true this is in the case of media ownership. A look at the poor consumer performance of the banking sector confirms the effect on so many other people. Look at the engine room of our economy, the small business sector&mdash;the mums and dads, the families, the individuals who give up a lot to try to make a go of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my electorate many struggle to compete, or have given up trying to compete, against the giants of retailing who have lobbied successfully for deregulation of trading hours. I am all for less but the result must always be better regulation. As Nick Greiner said in 1985:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government intervention must be in the public interest, not that of vested, special interest groups.</PARA>
<PARA>In this regard the government's stated plans to enshrine workers' freedom of choice in the new industrial relations legislation must make it a worthy bill. Vested interests within the system, especially the union bosses who have <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> forgotten the worker, are the only ones with anything to fear from any changes introduced by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith). I have no doubt that the legislation will ensure that individual workers are given the freedom to choose to bargain directly or, if they feel inadequate to the task, to empower their union to act on their behalf.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also support voluntary unionism. After all, this process will force union bosses to be more accountable to their membership. If the union bosses perform well, the membership of the union will support them and more people will join. But if the current detached style of union leadership continues, more and more people will vote with their feet and leave unions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problems we face in Australia today will be the problems which my children will inherit unless we act during the life of this 38th Parliament. For my children&mdash;Jessica is six and Ben will be four in a few weeks&mdash;this week has perhaps been a bit of a boring occasion but in some ways also a great adventure. It has been their first trip in an aircraft and they have visited a very strange world called Canberra. My children sought one assurance from me before the election&mdash;that, if elected, I would take them to Sea World. Mr Deputy Speaker, I am happy to report that it was the first of my election promises kept.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My daughter's understanding of politics, though, extended a little further. She knew Mr Keating was that nasty man who did not want Daddy to win&mdash;and that meant no trip to Sea World. So she, like many others in Moreton, had a great motivation to ensure there was a change of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today is a moment of great pride for my family. My parents taught me to work hard and make the most of opportunities. They were born and raised in average Australian working class families in and around Kogarah, Botany and Brighton in Sydney's south. My mother's family were real battlers; they had been around that area since the late 1700s. In fact, some of my ancestors earned a living fishing in the Cooks River and out into Botany Bay&mdash;they certainly could not do that today. My father learnt his trade as a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="145"> teenager. As a fitter and machinist he has worked his way to senior management with a leading carbide tooling company. Both my parents showed me the virtue of community service&mdash;active involvement in helping others around you in the true traditional Australian way of mateship, and lending a helping hand to others less fortunate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now turn to my grandparents; I am blessed to have three still living. They are people of a generation which gave so much to Australia. As children, they faced the first great war. They later built families, despite the Depression of the 1930s, and then fought the Second World War. They worked hard to build a great nation and a rich heritage which in so many ways has been squandered in recent years. Both my grandfathers are former truck drivers and labourers. One, I believe, voted Labor for probably most of his life&mdash;although he has not in the last few elections. The other was born and raised in Brisbane's southern suburbs in and around the Moreton electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, the genealogy will continue for just a moment to let you know that the Hardgrave family were Irish potato famine refugees who came to Brisbane in 1848. One ancestor, John Hardgrave, served as alderman for South Brisbane and later as Mayor of Brisbane in 1868 and 1869. All four of my grandparents, especially, gave me a real understanding about where a dollar comes from, how hard it can be to earn a living and how important family is above all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would now like to thank my wife. Like so many members, I come to this place as part of a team. My wife, Judy, brings her own skills and experience to the job. It is not easy for the spouses and families of people in politics, and Judy knows this all too well. I should also like to acknowledge my wife's parents, John and Joan Andrews, residents of the electorate of the honourable member for Longman (Mr Brough). They have played a ready role in the extended family support which helps my wife and I to do our job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is a great honour for me to stand here and represent the people of Moreton in this place. I am the eighth person to have been returned as the member for Moreton since this <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Federation seat was created in 1900. Moreton has always been a seat based on southern Brisbane suburbs. It has only ever returned two Labor members: its first member who held the seat for five years until 1906, and my immediate predecessor who held the seat for the last six years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Between those two Labor members for Moreton there spanned 84 years of strong and effective representation by members of the Liberal Party or its various early incarnations. I can only say that I will work very hard to ensure that, based on the merit of my performance as the local member and of course that of the government, we can earn another period of trust and goodwill within the Moreton electorate to rival the earlier one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to acknowledge a few more people. Probably the best known former member for Moreton, a man who is held in very high regard, is Sir James Killen. Sir James and Lady Killen were most effective advocates for my campaign. Jim honoured me greatly by his personal letter of support circulated throughout the electorate. The other former Liberal member for Moreton, Don Cameron, and his wife, Lila, are true friends. They have maintained their solid commitment to the local Moreton community and were always there throughout my campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Administrative Services, the member for Fadden, David Jull, has been my mentor and friend for over 22 years. He is well liked within my electorate. About 60 per cent of my constituents were very well represented in this place by Mr Jull until the 1993 election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another extra special mention I would like to make is of Senator David MacGibbon. I count the recent years I have worked on Senator MacGibbon's staff as a highly valuable addition to my experiences in life. Senator MacGibbon's vast experience and approach of genuine commitment to his state and nation have left a lasting impression.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My thanks also should go to my campaign director, John Caris. He directed a large and very effective local team. The Moreton Liberal campaign maintained its local focus because so many good people, active in my <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="146"> local area, came to help. I was lucky to have over 1,400 local people working on my campaign in one form or another&mdash;people who have long supported our party, the true&hyphen;blue believers; others who were determined to see a change for the better and wanted to make sure that it happened. The list is just too long to read here, you will be thankful to know, so my thanks and congratulations must go to all. Each is a great Australian, and I know that they are determined to keep me in touch with my local community. The partnership I offer the people of Moreton is just beginning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure that we will all consider carefully the impact of the important legislation which we will pass. As private members of the House of Representatives, we all have a role to play in advocating the right changes to ensure the right results for those we represent&mdash;and, to me, the people of my electorate will always come first.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will finish with the advice for Liberals from Alfred Deakin's 1895 speech <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">What is liberalism</EMPHASIS>. Deakin wanted Liberals to look at the issues and to tread the paths of progress. Deakin said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In doing so, they would make mistakes but they would leave the world on the whole a better place than they found it.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Deputy Speaker, Deakin's words of 101 years ago are still true for us today as we commence this 38th Parliament. I again thank the House for the courtesy extended to me.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity to congratulate the member for Moreton (Mr Hardgrave) on his inaugural speech. This is the second time that I have been elected as the member for Perth, and I thank the people of Perth for their confidence and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> trust. I propose to continue to work hard to earn their continued local support. Local representation is very important, and I regard the community obligations which come from that as being a most important part of a member's role.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to take this opportunity to  thank my campaign director, Dr Ric Charlesworth, who was, of course, my immediate predecessor. He again was successfully able to ensure my re&hyphen;election and again successfully able to ensure a swing towards my party in the division of Perth. I would also like to take the opportunity to thank my campaign committee and, in particular, my local state parliamentary colleagues who worked so hard to help ensure my re-election. They include the state member for Perth, Diana Warnock; the state member for Maylands, Judy Edwards; the state member for Morley, Clive Brown; the state member for Balcatta, Nick Catania; and the state member for Glendalough, Michelle Roberts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to take the opportunity of thanking my family for their help, support and sacrifice over the three&hyphen;year period of my first term. I believe in the notion of continuous campaigning so the election campaign period was simply four or five weeks on top of a three&hyphen;year term. There are the usual family sacrifices which come with that. I take this opportunity of thanking my wife Jane, my son Hugo and my daughter Madeleine, together with my mother and father who have been guiding lights and of continual support throughout my entire life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to relate a couple of Perth campaign matters to the House: one is important for those of my generation on our side and the other is a sad tale. On the Sunday after the election I was very pleased that the former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam rang me to congratulate me on my re&hyphen;election; to make the point to me of how fortunate one is to represent the city of one's state, whether it be, as in my case, Perth, or in the case of Arch Bevis in Queensland, the seat of Brisbane; and to encourage me to nominate for our party's executive, which I did. I thank my colleagues for accepting my successful nomination.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="147">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sad matter concerns one of the people whose advice I took over the three&hyphen;year period of the last parliament. I refer to a well&hyphen;known journalist in Western Australia, Ron Barry, a person whom I have known for many years in the various capacities in which I have worked for the Australian Labor Party during my adult life. He has been a source of good advice and considerable assistance over very many years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, Ron took ill in the course of the last quarter of 1995 and the first quarter of 1996 and tragically died recently at the age of 47. He was survived by his wife Carol and three young sons: Nicholas, Simon and Christopher. Ron was a journalist who, in my view, was exceptional amongst Western Australian political journalists and who also, from time to time, worked for the Australian Labor Party. Ron was the only WA political journalist I knew who had a timetable, horizon or view that was longer than that day's deadline. He could always give you sensible strategic advice and long&hyphen;term advice rather than the tactical advice which came from a newspaper or television deadline.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I invited Ron to my campaign launch which was conducted by the then Deputy Prime Minister and now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley). Ron attended with his two elder sons and told me how pleased he was that finally they were at last displaying some interest in public and national affairs. The last time I spoke to Ron was on the night of the election when, with the three&hyphen;hour time difference, we already had the bad general news. I rang Ron at home to tell him that, despite the bad general news, we had managed to sneak over the line in Perth. Ron did what he always did: he rejoiced in someone else's personal good fortune much more than he ever sought his own.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ron will be a great loss to the Western Australian journalistic community and a great loss to the Western Australian branch of the Australian Labor Party. Ron Barry worked for successive leaders of the WA parliamentary Labor Party from John Tonkin to Colin Jamison, Ron Davies, Brian Burke and Peter Dowding. He was an unpaid adviser to every state secretary of the Western Australian <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> branch of the ALP since Joe Chamberlain. It was fitting that his memorial service was attended by four leaders, current or former, of the state parliamentary Labor Party. I take this opportunity to extend again to Carol my deepest sympathy in a tragedy which cut short so early a great contribution and a great life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have referred to the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley. I was very pleased, of course, when he won the seat of Brand. On our side of the House we look forward to ensuring that, after Prime Minister Curtin and Prime Minister Hawke, in the not too distant future Western Australia will have its first naturally born Labor prime minister rather than an adopted one as was the case with John Curtin and Bob Hawke.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take this opportunity to congratulate my colleague the member for Fremantle, Dr Lawrence, on her re&hyphen;election. I extend my best wishes to George Gear, the former member for Canning, who lost his marginal seat. I wish Wendy Fatin, the former member for Brand, all the best in her retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also take this opportunity of congratulating the independent member for Kalgoorlie, Graeme Campbell, on his re&hyphen;election. Graeme resigned from the Labor Party and won the seat as an Independent&mdash;one of the five Independents in this House, three of whom come from Western Australia. I think I am one of only two people remaining in the Western Australian branch of the Australian Labor Party who has voted for Graeme Campbell twice in a pre&hyphen;selection. It was our national executive, acting out of my own best interests, which prevented me from having the opportunity of seeing whether I could deliver the hat&hyphen;trick. Despite the fact that in party political terms we have parted ways, I wish Graeme all the best in the course of this term of parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Graeme, of course, defeated Ian Taylor, the former state member for Kalgoorlie and former state leader of the parliamentary Labor Party. I have known Ian Taylor for over 20 years. Ian is a man of great integrity. There are two things about Ian which I have said publicly before: firstly, he has always put the interests of his party ahead of himself and, secondly, he is a person who has always been <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="148"> decent and good natured and public life has never deformed him. He was the same when he completed public life as he was when he began it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The night of the election was, of course, a very bad night for the Australian Labor Party, but it was also a very bad night for the Western Australian Liberal Party. That was the night when Richard Court's handcuff to Senator Noel Crichton&hyphen;Browne came home to rest. I take this opportunity of congratulating the independent member for Cutin, Mr Rocher, and the independent member for Moore, Mr Filing, on their success. Their success shows the failure of John Howard to display any form of leadership influence over the Western Australian branch of the Liberal Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Election night was a particularly bad night for the Court dynasty in Western Australia, with Richard's older brother Ken being comprehensibly defeated by Mr Rocher. I am sure, however, that the member for Curtin would be deeply distressed and disappointed to see that the current Prime Minister (Mr Howard), as the first of his broken promises, failed to deliver on the notion of a truly independent speaker. At the Press Club on the Thursday before the election, the current Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that is why I am committed, if I become Prime Minister of this country, I am committed to ensuring that the Australian parliament has a truly independent Speaker in every sense of the word.</PARA>
<PARA>I am sure that the member for Curtin took that as being an invitation to him, and we have seen him no doubt distressed about that. I am sure that those members who have been around for a while would understand the credentials that the member for Curtin has to take on the speakership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my inaugural speech nearly three years ago, I made the point that, as a result of my election, there were four Western Australian state secretaries of the ALP in the previous parliament&mdash;the then Senator McMullan, Senator Beahan, the President of the Senate, the then Senator elect Chris Evans, whom I congratulate on becoming the Senate Opposition Whip, and me. I made the point that it was clearly the case that, of the four state <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> secretaries, I had the best judgment because I had chosen the decent House. I am pleased to see that former Senator McMullan, the new member for Canberra, has come to his senses and joined us. I congratulate him as a former Western Australian on his election to this House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to take this opportunity to mention three fallen colleagues: the former member for Lindsay, Ross Free, for whom I worked for a short time while he was minister for science&mdash;he became not just an employer but a friend and subsequent colleague; the former member for Lowe, Mary  Easson, whom I sat next to in the chamber in the previous parliament; and the former member for Lilley and my former Queensland counterpart, the Queensland ALP state secretary, Wayne Swan. We on this side look forward to seeing them back, and I am sure they will be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the course of my campaign, I told the people of Perth that there were a range of local projects and issues that I was keen to pursue in this term of parliament. I will restate those commitments now. They include: working towards the establishment of a university in Midland; working for the establishment of a railway line from Bayswater to the airport in Perth; establishing a small business enterprise centre in Morley; transferring the Bassendean railway museum to the old Midland Westrail railway workshops in Midland; establishing a swimming pool and water playground complex in Beechboro&hyphen;Lockridge; creating a sensible community development of the Maylands clay pits; and creating more sensible transport options for Northbridge and the inner city.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of the election, our parliamentary party was beaten but not broken, bowed but not disgraced. We had plenty of achievements during our term in office which those on this side of the House can be proud of&mdash;including those in respect of job creation, living standards, health and education services and the protection of the environment. We have left the essential parameters of the economy in good shape&mdash;with consistent growth over a four-year period running at four per cent, low inflation and a sensible wages policy.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="149">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The features of our 13-year term in office include: increasing the labour force by over two million workers; creating more than 700,000 new jobs in our last three&hyphen;year term in office; massively increasing secondary school retention rates from 30 per cent to percentages in the high 60s or low 70s; massively increasing the number of university places; providing a massive injection of capital into TAFE facilities; creating universal access to health care through Medicare; and, in addition to some of those important economic parameters I have referred to, producing a massive increase in the diversity, range and quantity of exports, which have started the process of turning Australia into a modern trading and exporting country. In the end, `time for a change' as well as other factors got the better of us, but those are things that we on this side of the House can be very proud of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was very pleased that the Leader of the Opposition offered me the trade portfolio. I gladly accepted it, having a longstanding interest in trade and industry matters. I will endeavour to ensure that I do my best to explain to my own constituency and to the party's traditional supporters that trade, in very many respects, equals creation of jobs and maintenance of living standards. I note in passing that one of the very successful trade and exporting programs which was supported and sustained by our government is currently under threat&mdash;that is, the export market development grants scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I look forward with interest to taking up these issues with the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer). We need to ensure that our nation continues to drive towards success, and that success will be measured by the creation of jobs and maintenance of living standards in Australia and our continuation as a major trading and exporting country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the short time left to me, I will not traverse the same ground covered by my colleague the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham)&mdash;that is, the failure of the current government to adopt a sensible wages policy; the failure of the current government to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ensure that, at a time when interest rates can go down, they do go down; and, at a time when we have seen record low periods of industrial disputation in the course of our 13 years in office, those opposite are doing their best to ensure that industrial disputation comes to the fore again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, I take this opportunity as you enter the chair to personally convey my congratulations to you. In the course of this morning's debate on changes to our procedures, some of us took the opportunity to advise new members of the House about some of those arrangements. To those many new members opposite, I give this advice on a couple of other matters. So far as your employment is concerned&mdash;take leave; don't resign.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both services we attended were most moving&mdash;the first one was not really a service but there was a wreath laying associated with it. There is no doubt at all that there is a tremendously and terribly shocked community in Tasmania. I think it is up to all of us to do what we can&mdash;we all have travel rights as parliamentarians&mdash;to associate ourselves directly with what has happened to our fellow citizens in Tasmania, to give them encouragement and to see the fortitude with which they are bearing their trial. They are tremendously conscious of anything that anyone else elsewhere in Australia does to identify with their period of great difficulty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, it is not just people in Australia who have been directly affected; also at the gathering were the people most directly <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> affected, that is, families who had lost members or whose members had experienced injuries. That was tremendously moving as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister made some remarks about propositions to be put to the police ministers. He said that they were minimum propositions. The two that he announced we would absolutely endorse and we encourage him. All strength to his right arm as he uses it in whatever way he needs to in dealing with the states on this matter. He also announced a contribution to the appeal. We completely endorse that as well. He indicated that there may be other things that he wants to raise with the police ministers. If those matters could be in some way or another presented here in the House before he meets with them, that would be a good thing. If it is not possible to do that because he wants to take these matters more discreetly to those ministers, I completely understand that, but this is a matter where he might choose to find himself more broadly supported.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the first part of the question is yes. The answer to the second part of the question is that I can do little better on this occasion than draw upon the words of the new shadow Treasurer. On 28 February 1995 he had this to say in relation to a question about budget speculation:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . as I said yesterday, that to suggest that the government is going to introduce any new taxes on the tourism industry is nothing more than budget speculation and obviously neither I nor anybody else is going to be in the business of confirming or denying any particular element of budgetary speculation, not because to do so would be to reveal anything about that particular proposal, but to do so on any particular individual item immediately raises questions about multiple others . . .  <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="152"> </PARA>
<PARA>In effect what he was saying was that he was not going to give a running commentary on every piece of budget speculation. Let me say that I am not going to do so either. The budget will be introduced and introduced well by the Treasurer in August.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I say very deliberately to the honourable member and to all honourable members that the new coalition government takes very seriously the commitments that were made to the Australian people in the lead up to the election. I believe that keeping faith with the Australian people is a very important element of restoring the process of trust in government that was almost totally destroyed by the now defeated Labor administration. The way in which the members of the Keating government systematically and cynically dismantled their election commitments immediately after they were elected in 1993, as apparently the now defeated former Prime Minister acknowledges, was one of the major reasons that they were so ignominiously defeated on 2 March this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that the former finance minister, the now Leader of the Opposition, has left us with an $8 billion black hole makes the task that we have far more difficult. I want to say to the Australian people that I place enormous personal store and the members of my government place great collective store on keeping faith with the Australian people and meeting the commitments that were very much in the minds of the Australian people before the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know there will be a lot of speculation&mdash;some of it will be mischievous; some of it will be natural. To those people who believe that in some way we are going to respond in a running commentary sense to every piece of speculation, I say they are wrong. We are not. Let me repeat the commitments that I have given since the election about the protection of the more vulnerable members of our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To those people who would try to scare the daylights out of vulnerable people in the Australian community, to those opposite and others in the community, I invite them to pay very careful attention to what I said in the speech I delivered to the Australian Council <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of Social Service in October of last year.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me make it entirely clear that on the day after the election and on the Monday thereafter the Secretary to the Treasury disclosed to the Prime Minister and to me the state of the accounts as forecast by Treasury for 1996&hyphen;97.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me make it entirely clear that, if any member of the then government before 2 March had asked for the figures, they would have received exactly the same figures&mdash;exactly the same figures. I am now told that, as early as September in the previous year, the joint economic forecasting group was warning the government that its budget would not be as bottom line as was said in the budget papers and there was a blow&hyphen;out on the cards for 1996&hyphen;97.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Faced with the central deceit of the 1996 election campaign, the Leader of the Opposition has now entered a mode of denial.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say in relation to these costings that the costings debacle of this the worst Minister for Finance in any administration since Federation was a situation where the Department of Finance was essentially called in to do political work during the campaign, and he knows it; where the Department of Finance came back and essentially disputed your figures in relation to costings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact was, when the Department of Finance came back, you who had supposedly discovered a $4.9 billion hole were severely embarrassed.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the costings were finally released, let us all remember they were released with one of those shabby documents on the front&mdash;not done by the Department of Finance but done by the minister's political officers.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Remember the day when the costings had completely fallen apart and it was the Treasurer, embarrassed by the failure, who produced documents about as reliable as the costings.

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for his question. The answer to the question of what is wrong with the existing system would take longer than the time we have been given for question time. There are many features of the existing system which obviously cry out for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="155"> significant reform. The existing system was one of the factors which led to the worst recession for 60 years&mdash;a product of the economic incompetence of the previous government, including the current Leader of the Opposition. Over the 13 years of the previous administration, many Australians have seen falling living standards instead of higher living standards&mdash;something which we on this side believe Australians should be able to expect from the Australian economy&mdash;under the current industrial relations system. In respect of jobs, the current system fails to give people the opportunity to make a contribution to themselves, to their families and to our wider society by enjoying a job. No more is that apparent than it is for young people. It is a national disgrace that we have very high levels of youth unemployment in Australia. In some parts of regional Australia, youth unemployment rates of 30, 40 and 50 per cent are, sadly, far too common.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the challenge that this presents to the government, we have announced, and did so prior to the election, a set of comprehensive reforms to the industrial relations system. Included in those reforms will be a guarantee of the basic civil liberties of Australians at work&mdash;that is, the basic civil liberty to make a decision on whether or not they want to be in a union. We intend to enhance the right of people&mdash;to give them the choice&mdash;to decide which union they are in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also intending to introduce with our package a set of reforms that will ensure that parties to agreements and those covered by awards will be expected to meet their obligations under those agreements and under those awards. Furthermore, in respect of third parties, we will be introducing effective secondary boycott provisions, restoring to the Trade Practices Act provisions based on the old sections 45D and 45E.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lastly, as an indication of the problems, I do not think anybody could reasonably deny the significant problems that have arisen as a result of the previous government's introduction of a new part to the Industrial Relations Act in respect of unfair dismissals. That system has been responsible for a lot of people being unable to obtain work. Bob <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Carr, the Premier of New South Wales&mdash;a Labor Premier&mdash;said that the existing system is in fact a disincentive for employers to give people a job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We intend to change that system. It is going to be a fair system to both employers and employees. The great thing about that system is that it will give people a chance of a job, which was denied by the previous administration. The sum total is that we do have a significant package. We have been consulting very widely on it. It is aimed at giving people a chance of a job and boosting living standards.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

I think it is probably true to say the issue of land mines is one that is of concern to all Australians. I have received, both in opposition and in government, an enormous amount of correspondence from people urging Australia to take something of a leadership position in the context of the inhumane weapons convention review conference, which is now under way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of in particular the community concern expressed on this issue, after the election I called for a review of the previous government's position on landmines, in cooperation with my colleague the Minister for Defence, with a view to ensuring that we <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> establish a constructive position at the inhumane weapons convention review conference. As a result of that review, the government announced on 15 April that Australia would support a total ban on the production, stockpiling, use and transfer of landmines and that for our part as a country we would implement a unilateral suspension on the operational use of landmines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This took the position of the Australian government considerably further than the position of the previous government, as the member for Holt is only too well aware. The previous government's position was a somewhat confused, vacillating position. The confusion of the previous government was brought about by one simple fact: there could never be any agreement reached between the then foreign minister and Senator Robert Ray, the then defence minister. The squabble between the two, which I know the member for Holt would well remember&mdash;we find out about these things quite quickly after an election&mdash;left Australia with a position which was by no means one of leadership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of the position that we had taken, a number of countries have followed in our wake&mdash;not least of which are Germany, New Zealand and, to a limited extent, the United Kingdom.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make it entirely clear, as Treasurers have in the past, that it will not be the business of this government to speculate on movements in interest rates.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As all members of the House know, one of the great failures of the outgoing Labor government was its failure to do anything effective in relation to youth unemployment, which, for teenage full-time unemployment, remains at the level it was at when your Working Nation program was introduced. There are many reasons for this failure, but one of the major reasons for this failure was your total inability to address the literacy needs of young Australians and of those young people coming out of school and into the work force. Far too many young people are leaving school these days after year 10 without the skills that are most essential to jobs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 18 April Senator Vanstone and I met with a reference group of employers and employer organisations. The issue at the top of their agenda was the issue of literacy. They know that the greatest barrier to providing jobs to young Australians today is the fact that far too many of them are coming out of school without these absolutely essential skills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor government failed over the whole of its 13-year period in office to effectively help young people who are suffering literacy and numeracy deficits. It is not as if the problem was not recognised. Indeed the honourable member for Batman, when he was the President of the ACTU&mdash;and normally the previous government jumped to the instructions of the President of the ACTU&mdash;said six years ago: more than one million adult Australians were unable to read a simple sentence in English, understand simple telephone dialling instructions, fill out basic application forms or follow instructions for medication or product use.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> That was six years ago, and now nothing further has been done to alleviate this problem. When the states introduced their popula tion testing in primary schools&mdash;the years when those literacy skills can best be acquired&mdash;did they get any support from the government? No, they did not. There was a deafening silence from the Labor Party. We are going to change that. The states will have the full support of this government in their population testing at primary school level&mdash;grades 3 and 5 in particular&mdash;to identify and effectively help those young people who presently are slipping through the net and are not picking up those skills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also regard it as essential that after 13 years of neglect there has been no effort to establish proper baseline data on which Australians can assess the current state of literacy and the effectiveness of literacy policies. Despite widespread concern among parents, employers and the community no such study was made during the whole of the 13 years of the Labor government. The last such study was made in 1980 under a coalition government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now that the coalition has been returned, we will once again have a national English literacy survey. I have already written to the state governments seeking their support for the conduct of this survey. This survey will provide a clear view for the first time in 13 years of the state of English literacy levels amongst Australian students in years 3 and 5. It will enable us to target resources effectively. It will enable us to establish national benchmarks so that the Australian people, parents and the community, can assess whether or not government policies to help Australians acquire literacy skills are working.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Literacy is far too important to be left to fads or chance, or sacrificed on the altar of partisan politics and interest group and lobby group politics as it has for the last 13 years. It has been said that language is the most important technology that we possess. It is time that we made sure that this technology is provided to all Australian children at the years when they are best able to acquire it.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I addressed the Australian Council of Social Services in October last year as Leader of the Opposition, as well as putting down some broad approaches to the welfare safety net and the approach of the coalition in government to the welfare safety net, I announced that I would have a pilot program to tackle, specifically, one aspect of youth homelessness that caused a great deal of concern to a lot of people in the community. That was whether the youth homeless allowance was too freely and easily available and whether, in the process of the allowance being made available, the legitimate roles of families were not being properly catered for.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believed then, and I and the government continue to believe, that there is a very important role to be played by the voluntary welfare organisations in the process of assessing entitlement.

Captain Eldridge has had many years of experience in providing services for young homeless people and their families. The principal, but not the sole, object of this exercise is to see whether through the use of the expertise of the voluntary agencies we can get a better steer as to whether a young person who claims to be entitled to the homeless benefit ought to get that benefit on an ongoing basis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The pilots will operate on the basis of a person getting the homeless allowance for a provisional period of six weeks and then the person will be taken, in a sense, into a case management or care situation by an individual agency. That agency will see whether any reconciliation with the family can be established. They will counsel, talk to and assess the young person and, after a period, they will make a recommendation to the department about whether there will be an ongoing benefit granted.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. Award simplification is a very good idea. In fact, the advantages of it are, very simply, that it gives our businesses the chance to employ more people and to pay them more. To pay people more and to give people the chance of higher wages in the future are obviously a key part <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="162"> of what we want to do. This has been missing in the industrial relations system in recent years. One of the legacies of the previous government is that, when you take everything into account, many people were paid less and their living standards fell as a result.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a sense, the idea of award simplification is not just shared by those on this side. In fact, when those on the other side were in government, on a number of occasions they said, `Yes, it's a good idea, there are real advantages in doing so.' We give them credit for saying so. The real problem with those on the other side is they were never actually able to implement such a process of award simplification. The previous Prime Minister, Mr Keating, said in April 1993:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me describe the model of industrial relations we are working towards. It is a model which places primary emphasis on bargaining at the workplace level within a framework of minimum standards provided by arbitration tribunals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a model under which arbitrated awards and arbitrated wage increases would be there only as a safety net. This safety net would not be intended to prescribe the actual conditions of work of most employees but only to catch those unable to make workplace agreements with employers. Over time, the safety net would inevitably become simpler. We would have fewer awards with fewer clauses.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the one thing on which I agreed with the previous Prime Minister. The sad truth is that, after 13 years of Labor, they were never able to implement that policy. In fact, it was people like the member for Batman when he was President of the ACTU who vetoed sensible reform that could give people the chance of a job and higher wages in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a new government. We are intent on giving people a chance of a job. We are intent on giving people a chance to enjoy higher pay. We will be introducing in our package a means by which that can happen. It will be done under the supervision of the commission. It will be done on the basis that people are guaranteed their wages. It will be done fairly. It will be done in a reasonable way.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think what very clearly emerges from this first question time of the new government is the very strange approach of the Leader of the Opposition. He is into a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="163"> complete denial situation. He is really denial&hyphen;squared. The first piece of denial is that it really does not exist. That is the first bit. The second bit of denial is that, if it does exist, it does not really matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things I think ought to be burnt into the consciousness of every member of the now defeated Labor government is that, for the 13 years they were in office, unarguably the area of their greatest economic failure was that they gave to this country the worst current account deficit in the Western world&mdash;and that is what it was in 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No matter what other things they may talk about&mdash;and I have never been one to say that every single thing that the former government did in the economic area was wrong; I have never done that, and I will not be changing that approach in the future&mdash;can I say to the Leader of the Opposition: the one thing you got comprehensively wrong every year, and you left it in an absolutely shambolic state when you left government, was the current account deficit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two reasons why we have a big current account deficit and a large foreign debt. The first reason is that we are badly in need of micro-economic reform. Until that is tackled, you will not start to reduce the current account deficit. The second reason, as you well know and even I think the shadow Treasurer knows&mdash;and anybody with any economic literacy on the front bench of the opposition knows&mdash;is that we have an appallingly low level of national savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now those two things have to be tackled. You know as well as do I that, unless we tackle the budget deficit, unless measures are taken to reduce the size of the budget deficit, unless we have an honest approach to the budget deficit through a charter of honesty, we are never going to boost our national savings. So every time you deny that there is a budget deficit problem, every time you deny that even if there is a problem it does not matter&mdash;every time you engage in that double denial, you are demonstrating a complete indifference to fundamental economic problems that you yourself asserted existed when you were in government.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZI4">Mr ROCHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, during the recent election campaign a direct mail letter was circulated throughout the electoral division of Curtin under the signature of the now Treasurer, the member for Higgins (Mr Costello). In exhorting the electors to vote for the endorsed Liberal candidate&mdash;not surprisingly&mdash;the Treasurer quoted, by way of justification, from an article published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>  dated 11 April 1995. The article was written by Mr Peter Walsh, a former Labor senator and minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In seeking to convince the voters to not vote Independent in Curtin, the member for Higgins cited a brief excerpt from Mr Walsh's article. The article included the words: `It'&mdash;meaning a vote for me according to Mr Walsh&mdash;`could easily be the difference between winning and losing.' The article from which only one sentence was lifted&mdash;and indeed the entire article&mdash;made no reference to Independent candidates. In discussing the Liberal Party's prospects in Western Australia Mr Walsh wrote in the relevant paragraph&mdash;and this is the general tenor of the whole article:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With a bit of luck and good management, they could win 10 out of 14, or 11 if Brand also falls. On the other hand, the Crichton&hyphen;Browne factor and associated intra&hyphen;party brawling could take the Liberal seats down to five or six.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the sentence that the Liberal member for Higgins chose to use:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It could easily be the difference between winning and losing. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="166"> </PARA>
<PARA>So you can see, Mr Speaker, that the reason for Mr Walsh concluding that the difference between the Liberals not winning up to 11 seats and instead being successful in only five or six was, in Mr Walsh's view, `the Crichton&hyphen;Browne factor and associated intra&hyphen;party brawling' in the Liberal Party. It had absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with me as an Independent candidate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The misrepresentation is borne out by the date when the article was published&mdash;11 April 1995. At that time I was a member of the Liberal Party, a condition I had to endure, I must say, for a further four months. For Mr Costello to claim that a vote for me could somehow be the difference between the coalition winning and losing, and justifying that with a published view of Mr Walsh, is unerringly false.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second misrepresentation occurred on another occasion. In an advertisement published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Post</EMPHASIS> newspaper edition of 20 February this year the now Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is quoted as having said&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Before attending to the formal statement, Mr Speaker, since this is the first opportunity I have had since your election to speak at the dispatch box, may I offer you my congratulations on your election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ministerial statement relates to a new format for bills and acts. The format currently in use for bills introduced into this parliament has evolved gradually since 1901. It has been only in the last 10 years or so, however, that attention has been paid to the effect on readers of the format in which legislation is set out. This has happened in the context of a growing community expectation that legislation that affects people ought to be accessible to those people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The accessibility of legislation has several aspects. First, of course, the text of the legislation needs to be comprehensible to its intended audience. As well, legislation needs to be physically accessible to its intended audience&mdash;that is, people need access to up&hyphen;to&hyphen;date versions of current legislation, whether in the form of reprints of acts or electronic databases containing consolidated legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those who still use printed copies of legislation&mdash;which, of course, includes members of this parliament&mdash;the page design and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> layout of legislation also affect its accessibility. Document design is now recognised as a matter which can have a significant impact on the comprehensibility of documents and on how effectively documents communicate information. With this in mind, the Office of Parliamentary Counsel has undertaken a project to improve the design and layout of bills, which of course will also impact on the design and layout of acts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The result of this project is a new format, which has been adopted by the office for future bills. The main features of the new format are these: there is a substantial increase in the amount of `white space' on each page. This makes the pages look less forbidding, and this in turn contributes to the reader's confidence in dealing with the text. Running headers are used on the top outside corner of each page. The inclusion of section numbers in the running headers will make searching for particular provisions easier. The inclusion of chapter, part and division headings in the running headers will make it easier for readers to interpret individual provisions in context.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section and subsection numbers are separated out from the text, to make searching for particular provisions easier. Vertical spacing, variable font sizes and different margins give visual clues to the hierarchical relationships between different elements of the text. The text of bills will no longer be right&hyphen;justified. The use of a `ragged' right&hyphen;hand margin makes text easier to read because it means that the spacing between words is the same in each line, rather than varied to ensure a straight right&hyphen;hand margin. All bills will contain a table of contents. Among other things, the table will show all acts amended or repealed by the bill. The first page of a bill will now be a cover page including the long title. The table of contents will start on the inside cover page.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Several bills were introduced in the last parliament in experimental formats. Now that the new format is settled, it will be used for almost all bills introduced from now on. The new format will also be adopted for reprints of existing acts. There will be a longer transitional period for reprints, because it will take <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="169"> some time to convert all existing electronic versions of acts into the new formats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to thank a number of people who advised the Office of Parliamentary Counsel during the development of the new formats. These include: the clerks of both houses of this parliament, the Tax Law Improvement Project and the Corporations Law Simplification Unit&mdash;in particular the communications experts working with each of those groups&mdash;the Australian Government Publishing Service and the Communication Research Institute of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those of us who are familiar with the current forms of Commonwealth legislation will need some time to get used to the new formats. However, I am confident that these formats represent a genuine contribution to the accessibility of Commonwealth legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The work of the Office of Parliamentary Counsel goes relatively unnoticed, but in my view the Parliamentary Counsel perform the role of unsung heroes and heroines in the legislative process. While there are some people who have criticisms of the drafting from time to time, on most occasions there is none and the silence that goes with it is not really an appropriate recognition of the work done by Hilary Penfold and her officers. I present the following paper:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition welcomes the changes announced today to the format for bills and acts. The changes will make it easier for people to use bills and acts and thus will ensure greater knowledge, understanding and accessibility to the law. These changes were in an advanced state of preparation under the previous government. The changes were recommended to the previous government by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel following the experi <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> ence gained in the corporations and tax law initiatives undertaken by Labor. The changes form a natural part of the commitment to access to justice pursued vigorously under Labor. Indeed, this very day was foreshadowed in the Justice Statement launched by the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, in May last year. I quote from page 121 of the Justice Statement under the heading `Drafting of Legislation':</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clear and unambiguous legislation will make laws easier to understand and easier to access. Careful drafting of acts of parliament and delegated legislation is required to ensure easy access.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commonwealth drafting agencies now make a concerted effort to use a plain English style of drafting. This involves the use of simple language, flow charts and readers' guides designed to make legislation easy to follow. Further improvements will be made by using Schedules and tables, rewriting drafting handbooks, training officers of Departments and Government agencies in drafting and instructing techniques, clarifying when material should be in Acts or other legislation and testing draft legislation in appropriate cases. An improved design and layout for Commonwealth Bills and Acts will be introduced.</PARA>
<PARA>That was under the Labor Party's access to justice statement. I congratulate and commend the new government on endorsing and implementing initiatives of the former Labor government. Keep it up.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="170"> government had not abandoned the accord and wages policy as it has, there would be no reasonable doubt that we would be looking right now at a significant reduction in interest rates&mdash;one that home buyers need and deserve; one that business would enormously welcome as a further incentive to invest; and one that would be tremendously welcomed by those unemployed men, women and youngsters around the country who are hanging on a further stimulus to economic activity to get them back into the work force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clear from everything that the Reserve Bank has been saying in recent weeks that we are not going to see an interest rate reduction right now. Why not? Because there is significant uncertainty about the future movement of wages growth in present circumstances and whether that will be consistent with the achievement of the underlying target rate, about which everyone agrees, of inflation of two to three per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why is there, in turn, that uncertainty? Because the coalition has torn up the accord, because it has abandoned wages policy as a crucial instrument of economic policy management in this country and because it has created a climate of conflict and confrontation with the trade union movement&mdash;a movement which, if the accord had been maintained, would have been absolutely committed allies in the economic management of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not just the Australian Labor Party that is saying all this. Virtually every significant economic commentator in recent days and weeks has nominated uncertainty over wages growth as the key influence on future monetary policy. Syntec&mdash;which I said during question time is not a Labor front organisation; we all know that&mdash;has been the most explicit of all commentators in this respect, saying in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 25 April, just last week:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The opposition is right in saying now that under a Labor Government falls in official interest rates would be occurring.</PARA>
<PARA>This is not just out of a clear blue sky so far as Syntec is concerned. It made the point weeks earlier in a corporate brief to its clients on 1 April. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cyclical picture in this Brief suggests that if Labor had regained office in a setting of wage&hyphen; <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> restraint embrace with the unions, Australian rates would have fallen soon after the election. Such is the tension between the Coalition and the unions, however, that that is not in prospect.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, talking about the government, Syntec said on 12 April: </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Government without the need to keep the labour market suppressed enough to deny the unions their wages push would be looking for an interest rate cut about now.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Labor Government with any sort of post-election Accord would have been legitimately looking for a cut in interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the judgment of the financial community as articulated by an organisation which has traditionally been no friend of ours. It is simply making an objective judgment as it sees it about the condition of the economy and the condition of the policy environment now prevailing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By 25 April, this judgment had been very much reinforced for the entire financial community by two sets of figures which confirmed that we were absolutely on track as a country in meeting our growth and unemployment reduction objectives. Inflation, you will recall from the figures last week, was confirmed at decreasing, so far as the normal headline rate is concerned, from 5.1 per cent to 3.7 per cent for the 12 months to March&mdash;with the underlying rate, which most policy makers regard as a bit more crucial, running at just 3.3 per cent but universally expected to fall below three per cent later this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second set of figures to come out last week related to wages growth. That was confirmed as having come back to a remarkably low 4.2 per cent&mdash;absolutely consistent with the accord target, and with every reason to expect that, had the accord remained in place, that target would continue to be met. All this emerged and these figures came out in the context of an economy with an overall growth rate currently running at three per cent&mdash;the highest amongst the major OECD economies, and that is something to be very pleased about&mdash;even at the bottom of our business cycle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Putting all that together, conditions were exactly right for an interest rate reduction. There was no need to fear overheating of the economy&mdash;inflation was down, wages growth was subdued and the accord was in place as <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="171"> at 2 March to keep things that way. At the same time, the economy was running at one per cent less growth than it needed to be running&mdash;that is, around four per cent rather than its present three per cent&mdash;to get the assault on unemployment back on the road. We all know that if we are really going to make a big impact or a significant net impact on unemployment we have to get the growth rate up from three per cent, where it is now, to where it has been for the last three years, which is four per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only reason that reduction has not already happened is, as I intimated previously, that the Reserve Bank of Australia is nervous, and understandably very nervous, about what the future wage growth will be and whether, in the absence of the accord and in the whole moderate social wage compensation strategy that is associated with the accord, it can be down around 4&half; per cent, which is where it needs to be held if we are going to maintain inflation at that underlying rate of between two and three per cent. The Reserve Bank is concerned that in the new political environment, after 2 March, where the accord has been torn up and where wages policy has been abandoned as an instrument of economic management, wages growth will not now be able to be sustained at the level which has been achieved under the accord and which has clearly been demonstrably achieved over the last six months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no point in saying, as the Treasurer (Mr Costello) will undoubtedly bellow in his reply, that the budgetary circumstances have changed all this. It is no good talking about inflation, wages growth and growth of the economy as a whole as at 2 March and then saying, `We now have a big deficit problem to contend with.' It is no good saying that the prospect of a deficit next year&mdash;if there is no further revision; we expect there will be in growth numbers to change that figure&mdash;has removed any possible case for a cut in rates now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point is this: there is simply no natural and automatic trade&hyphen;off between budget cuts and interest rate reductions. In fact, if the government's budget cuts involve, as seems inevitable if these targets are to be met&mdash;and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> certainly we heard nothing from the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) or any of the other ministers today to suggest otherwise&mdash;the slashing of social programs in areas like health, education, housing and child care, then interest rates are much more likely to rise than to fall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why do I say that? Simply this: in that budgetary environment, in that policy environment, workers will seek higher wages than they would otherwise have been minded to seek in order to compensate for cuts in essential social services. Faster wages growth, not fully backed by productivity improvements&mdash;and it is difficult to see that it possibly could be backed by productivity improvements in the context I am describing&mdash;means higher inflation and that means not lower interest rates but, of course, higher interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only chance of a linkage that I can see between government budgetary policy and lower interest rates is that, if this government succeeds in its slash and burn of some $8 billion worth of savings over the next couple of years, the contractionary impact of all that on the economy will be such that we will desperately need interest rate cuts in order to restore the level of economic activity back to where we are now. That is the only rational connection I can see between the budget cuts enterprise and interest rate cuts. Otherwise all the pressures are running the other way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, putting aside all that speculation, just look at what the financial community is now saying. Even after taking full account of all these budget scenarios that are running around, the overwhelming view of private sector economists at the moment is that you will not see an interest rate cut at all in the Australian economy. In fact, the overwhelming view is that the next move in interest rates, whenever it occurs, six months, nine months out, is going to be up, not down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So that is the first economic return this government has delivered to the Australian people since the election. The first economic return, the first economic benefit, we have had from them is the loss of otherwise almost certain interest rate cuts right here and now. You have lost it; you have blown it for the Australian people. You have blown it for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="172"> home buyers. You have blown it for small business. You have blown it for the unemployed who are hanging on this because of your manic, ideological preoccupation with tearing up accords and abandoning wages policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me turn, finally, to this larger issue of economic policy that is involved in all of this. By abandoning wages policy as an instrument of macro&hyphen;economic policy management over all policy management in this country, John Howard, the Prime Minister, is taking us straight back to the two-instrument economic policy of the past&mdash;that past, which the Prime Minister well remembers when he was Treasurer, when the whole emphasis was simply on fiscal and monetary policy, and you did not have wages policy as a crucial third leg of the tripod. That two&hyphen;instrument economic policy was what delivered Australia their lamentable average growth record under the Fraser&hyphen;Howard government of 2.1 per cent. That was the average growth that was delivered under that particular economic strategy the last time the Prime Minister was in office under the Fraser&hyphen;Howard government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was the three&hyphen;instrument approach&mdash;fiscal, monetary and wage policy, together with structural policy there in support as well and, more recently, a savings policy through superannuation&mdash;with wages policy as a key third item that in fact delivered under the Labor government an average 3.7 per cent growth for the whole of our 13 years in office&mdash;a 3.7 per cent average versus a 2.1 per cent average. The crucial difference in the approach, apart from all the micro&hyphen;economic reform we introduced, was our total reliance on wages policy as a crucial third leg in the economic policy strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, there are some other strands to Labor's economic legacy that will continue under this government, that will not be torn up: micro&hyphen;economic reform and the new emphasis throughout the economy on productivity improvement will, hopefully, continue, and that will be helpful in keeping things moving. But will that be sufficient to stop us sliding back to what seems now to be the generally accepted speed limit for developed economies like the United States of around <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 2&half; per cent growth? That is the prevailing, understood constraint that exists in most of the other developed economies, particularly the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unless you break out of that constraint and bring wages policy into play as a crucial supplementary instrument to add to monetary policy and to add to fiscal policy, you run a number of risks. You run the risk of losing the cooperative as distinct from the heavy&hyphen;handed fiscal and monetary routes to maintaining low inflation. You certainly lose every chance of maintaining the kind of profit share that has been enjoyed by business right throughout the 1980s and continuing up to the present day. With that risk of higher inflation and lower profit sharing and the lower investment that goes with it, you lose the growth that you need to bring us to what remains a very achievable target of just five per cent unemployment by the year 2000. We can meet that target by creating 220,000 new jobs each year. That is a very achievable target of four per cent or thereabouts growth of the kind we averaged during our last three years in office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can get there as a nation. As a country we can do it. But we can only get there through a sensible, intelligent, rational application of all the tools of economic management that are available to us. If you tear up some of those tools for no other reason than a Thatcherite, ideological preoccupation with small government and distaste for the trade union movement, distaste for the accord and a belief in letting the market rip in every available context and not doing that which is necessary to continue an enormously productive partnership of the kind that we have had over the last 13 years, that is the result that you produce&mdash;the incapacity to produce these kinds of outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is a very high risk game that the government is now playing. For ideological reasons, as I have just said, not for rational economic reasons, it is putting at risk the whole future course of decent economic management in this country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans) on his maiden speech, as one should do in circumstances like this, but of course the content of it was essentially flawed. The claim that here we are, two months after the 2 March election, and interest rates would have fallen but for the election of the coalition is preposterous. I suppose that, after suffering the humiliating defeat and after being held to account by the Australian people in the way that the Australian Labor Party was, one would have to think up some way of consoling oneself that the Australian people got it wrong and you got it right. Whatever consolation this may give you, it is not grounded in fact. It is a preposterous claim. Only somebody who is a fool or a knave would try to run it. It is easily disposed of, and I will dispose of it by referring to one media report. The Deputy Leader based his claim on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  of 25 April 1996. The economics editor in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  had this to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labor's new shadow treasurer, Gareth Evans, entered the fray yesterday for the first time with the claim that an interest rate cut would have been on the cards now if John Howard had not scrapped the accord.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is silly stuff, since it is perfectly obvious the excessive rate of wage increase that is alarming the Reserve Bank took place under the Accord.</PARA>
<PARA>`This is silly stuff'! All one should have done was turn to the front of the newspaper rather than the back, and of course the facts speak for themselves. But I would like to try to draw some more interesting political lessons out of the speech which the member for Holt has just made because it illustrates what is going to be a very difficult choice for the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 20 March 1996 the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, under the headline `Beazley cuts close links with the ACTU', carried the following statement from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley):</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The quite symbiotic relationship in the accord policy making process, if you like, disappears. The union movement has to make its own way.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say that Mr Beazley hedged on a new accord, pointing out the circumstances which led to the original deal no longer existed. That was a very interesting statement from the Leader of the Opposition and one which I congratulated him on making at the time. Plainly, he realised the failures of the accord. If the accord had been a success, you would not now have a minority of votes in the House of Representatives approaching 40.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The accord was clearly and patently a failure and the Leader of the Opposition&mdash;I think on 20 March 1996&mdash;recognised that and tried to come to terms with it, as indicated in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> headline `Beazley cuts close links with the ACTU'. I would recommend that path to the opposition. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, of course, unable to break the symbiotic relationship and aware that the Labor Party fronts in this chamber as the political wing of the ACTU, comes into this chamber and runs nonsensical propositions that, if only we had the ACTU directing economic policy, how much happier it would be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me tell you: the ACTU directed economic policy for 13 years and the results speak for themselves. Thirteen years of the accord gave us the worst current account deficit in the industrialised world&mdash;worse than Mexico's. Thirteen years of the accord took net foreign debt from $23 billion to $185 billion. Thirteen years of the accord found that the average compound growth rate in the CPI was 7.2 per cent in Australia whereas it was 3.8 per cent in the G7. Thirteen years of the accord led to an increase in Commonwealth debt now approaching $100 billion. Thirteen years of the accord got Australia an $8 billion deficit after four or five years of economic recovery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 2 March it was the voice of the Australian people that said that the political wing of the ACTU, the Australian Labor Party, which has let Australia down so badly, will be banished to the benches of the opposition because it is time to start rebuilding this country. The truth is that it is time to start <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="174"> rebuilding this country. I have to tell you: it gives us no joy to have been passed an Australia which we find in the position that it is currently in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the speech that was just given by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, there was no appreciation whatsoever as to how Labor failed Australia&mdash;no apology; no recognition; no attempt to come to terms with it; and no attempt to deal with it. We heard the statement from the Leader of the Opposition that he considered Prime Minister Keating a legend of the Labor Party. I know it is the opening of the parliament, but I was thinking of making this a bipartisan policy because there are 20 new coalition members on this side of the House who do consider Paul Keating to be a legend&mdash;because of the contribution that he made to their election on 2 March. But there was no attempt whatsoever to come to grips with the fact that the accord and the economic policy of Labor over 13 years failed and failed Australia badly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The interest rates which we are left with now are the result of the accord. The interest rates which were pushed up at the end of 1994, because this government was running such a lax fiscal policy, were a direct consequence of the accord&mdash;three increases over the period from August to December 1994&mdash;and persisted for the last 18 months. For the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to walk in here with the preposterous claim, `If we had only had another month they would have fallen,' is just to indicate how out of touch this opposition has become.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had expected that on 2 March a little bit of reality therapy would have been delivered but, alas, it may take a few more defeats to deliver that reality therapy. I speak for our backbench: we are very happy to engage in that therapy over the next couple of years to make sure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that throughout the period of the accord Australia had stunted productivity and high interest rates and a government that was addicted to debt and deficit. They were debt and deficit junkies, running a $100 billion build&hyphen;up in Commonwealth debt&mdash;to $100 billion. So we get to the situation where public debt interest under you&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, get it fixed in your head that we are talking about Commonwealth debt. Do you know the difference between Commonwealth debt and net foreign debt&mdash;a Commonwealth debt of about $100 billion? I will let you in on a secret: the Commonwealth owes 100 per cent of Commonwealth debt. We got to a situation where, after health and social security, public debt interest&mdash;servicing our debt&mdash;was rivalling defence and education spending. It was a policy of spending today and building debt for the children of tomorrow. The member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) used to talk about the `let the children pay policy' of living beyond our means today and passing on to future Australians the results of that profligacy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we talk about balancing the budget we talk about a policy for future Australians so that this generation can stand up and say to them, `We were the people who decided to live within our means and give children a fair go.' This government is not going to compete. It is not going to follow the profligate policy of Labor, the intergenerational stealing from the future which was the policy of debt which Labor led us into.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can stand here with pride and say, `It will take some tough decisions.' We would have expected to inherit an Australia which was in much better shape but I tell you that the sooner we start on undoing that deficit, the sooner we can stabilise borrowing and the sooner we can give a better future to the Australians who will inherit this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the accord was such a great success, how is it that at the height of the accord, in 1989&hyphen;90, home interest rates got to 17 per cent? How is it that the overdraft under this great, successful accord was at 21 per cent? How is it that Australia, even today, as a result of this accord is suffering some of the highest bank prime interest rates in the world? We still are. It is a legacy of 13 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In April 1986 Labor gave Australia record home mortgage interest rates of 15.5 per cent. In 1989 they hit 17 per cent. Labor, under the accord, had taken Australians into the worst recession in 60 years. Australians have not forgotten how Labor raised the interest rates <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="175"> again 1994, how they went down the same path because, as far as they saw it, it was more important to use taxes to buy votes. The great day of reckoning came on 2 March. It is going to take this government some time to undo the damage, but we will make sure that we do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say in relation to the accord that the great failure of the accord&mdash;and those opposite know it&mdash;was that the accord could never build productivity in this country. The reason the Reserve Bank says that it has a target for interest rates of around five per cent is its premise of a two per cent increase in productivity. A two per cent increase in productivity will bring the underlying inflation rate down about three per cent. But you can bring that underlying inflation rate lower if you can boost productivity&mdash;and the very cornerstone of our reform program is to boost productivity by having a new system of industrial relations which will allow employers and employees to agree. That will boost productivity. It will be a system of industrial relations in which there will not be third&hyphen;party interference, one which encourages cooperation in the workplace and which, above all, can get the productivity gains which we need in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Out there in the Australian economy were all these areas crying out for reform and improvement. The waterfront, transport and communications were crying out. The previous government for 13 years had put them in the too&hyphen;hard basket because Bill and the ACTU said no. Bill said, `No, let's leave cabotage in place.' Bill said, `No, let's run an uncompetitive waterfront.' Bill said, `No, we can't do anything about the stevedoring industry.' Bill said, `No, we can't have agreements in the workplace.' Well, on 2 March, the Australian people said yes. They said, `We don't want to hive off those areas of the Australian economy which, under the accord, have been quarantined from improvement.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We want the opportunity to boost productivity and, on the back of boosted productivity to boost wages and give Australia the opportunity to grow without running into the perennial speed limits that defeated the previous government over and over, the speed <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> limits of the current account and interest rates. On 2 March the Australian people decided that there was a much better way than the accord&hyphen;Labor way&mdash;the low productivity, high interest rate, high current account, high debt, high foreign liability way that you had, over 13 years, put the Australian economy into.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We say to the Australian work force that there is an opportunity with a better system to build a new relationship. We say to the Australian employees that on the back of low inflation and high productivity we can deliver better wage outcomes. We say to them that there is the opportunity for cooperation and consensus in the workplace and, if it does not suit the union fiefdoms or those who need the trade union movement to organise their preselection to this place, that is not a reason for holding back the opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also say to those in the work force that there is an opportunity to build that consensus and come to that agreement with a new system of industrial relations which can become the model for cooperation and which can allow the opportunity, free of third&hyphen;party intervention, for employers and employees to agree. It will be a better system of industrial relations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to a better system of industrial relations and in relation to fixing the fiscal problem, taking up competition and engaging in the reform which those opposite declared off limits, with the growth that Australia can expect, means the legacy of the new government under the change the Australian people made on 2 March will be an opportunity for a better future and an opportunity to put behind a decade of defeat. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have pleasure in seconding the motion moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans). The Treasurer (Mr Costello) failed to address the issue in this motion, which essentially is: a lack of wages policy in the economic armoury of a government keeps pressure on interest rates and monetary policy because you are limiting your options.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whatever the Treasurer wants to say about his ideological view of the accord, he cannot <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="176"> get away from the fact that a government, if it is serious about addressing the economic equation, has to come to grips with having a wages policy. A simple reality in this country is that you cannot have a wages policy unless you have a dialogue with the people who set wages. There are no federal powers to do it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the absence of those federal powers and because of the role that the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission plays in setting wages in this country, based on arguments and pressures that the ACTU, unions and others pursue, what is needed for a wages policy is, first, a preparedness to engage them in dialogue and, secondly, a basis on which they can negotiate&mdash;not the gun at the head or take it or leave it approach, which the government have always accused them of doing and which they are now presenting them with, but a sensible approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this debate there is no point the Treasurer making a segmental analysis about why we have problems. Any Treasurer worth their salt knows they need a balance between fiscal, monetary and wages policy if they are to achieve the improvement they seek. With no wages policy you get imbalance. It is impossible to get the balance that we were able to generate in our period of office. Lack of a wages policy simply means heavier reliance on monetary policy, which is why interest rates are not coming down, and heavier reliance on fiscal policy, which is why the government has a slash and burn mentality in the lead&hyphen;up to this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Treasurer squibbed two issues that were directed to him today by way of questions. Firstly, he was asked whether he would indicate when there would be a fall in interest rates and, secondly, whether his inability to do it was due to a lack of wages policy. What was his answer: `It is not the role of government to speculate on the movement of interest rates.' Yet when he was in opposition he constantly asked us as a government to speculate on interest rates, on when the next drop would be. What a hypocrite!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The second issue that was addressed to him was in the context of budget honesty and opening up the books. He was asked to release the costings associated with his prom ises and that of his government in the lead-up to the last election. What did he say? He said that we are not going to get them. In other words, the government will release something before an election but they will not give it to us after the election. They will keep that hidden from us. Even though they have the information, they will not give it to us. Some honesty! Some indication of the primacy of this place over the executive, where you will keep that information hidden amongst the Expenditure Review Committee and maybe amongst some of the other members in cabinet, when you will not let the parliament understand the basis upon which your fiscal challenge is really being directed!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the so&hyphen;called $8 billion hole behind which you want to hide, to confirm what the shadow Treasurer has been saying over the past couple of weeks let me quote what that hole is supposed to be made up of. I can quote no better source&mdash;other than my colleague the shadow Treasurer&mdash;than the Governor of the Reserve Bank, who had this to say on 28 March in Sydney:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My own hunch is that growth in 1996/97 will be a bit stronger than 3&frac14; per cent, implying a lower starting point deficit.</PARA>
<PARA>This House needs to know what your promises will cost, because we found before the election a $1.2 billion gap and there is still $3.3 billion sitting out there because they did not have enough information from you when you were in opposition to be able to do the costings. They have had that information ever since 2 March. They have had the ability to work with you, and we have seen not one iota. You come into this House and refuse to give it to us but want to pretend that you are into budget honesty and the primacy of this place. What hogwash! Some honesty! Some primacy!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mention has been made in this place of what the accord has not achieved. I remind the House that what we were able to achieve under accord mark VII, the one before last, over the last three years&mdash;not just the 13 years that the shadow Treasurer has referred to&mdash;is average economic growth greater than four per cent each year, the fastest of the OECD; inflation at 2&half; per cent; wages growth in the order of four per cent to five per cent; industrial disputation two-thirds lower than it was when you left office; and the creation of 714,000 jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to those 714,000 jobs, I remind the House of what the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) had to say of the accord commitment to jobs. Three years ago he described the accord mark VII's jobs target of 500,000&mdash;it was 500,000 at the time&mdash;as `an insult to the intelligence of the Australian people.' What did we deliver? Seven hundred and fourteen thousand jobs. Some insult! The then Leader of the Opposition did not believe we could achieve it. But the reality is that it was an objective that the accord set itself&mdash;not just in jobs but in wages policy, inflation and industrial disputes&mdash;and it was delivered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what did accord mark VIII have in prospect? It went a step further. There was a commitment from the trade union movement to this. The accord said that it was `based on and consistent with maintaining an underlying rate of inflation of two to three per cent on average over the cycle'. In other words, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> wages policy would be delivered under the accord consistent with that objective. You have washed that away. I do not know how anyone can come into this place as a Treasurer and pretend that they have an objective of maintaining this underlying rate of inflation, yet wash away the very mechanism by which they would achieve it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Accord mark VIII went further. It also said that the wage claims that the trade union movement would be making would be consistent with achieving a new target in terms of employment growth of 600,000 jobs over its life&mdash;in other words, at least 200,000 jobs per year, thereby taking us to that objective of five per cent unemployment which we had set ourselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple facts are that you cannot get wages policy in this country unless you get the cooperation of the trade union movement. You will not get the cooperation of the trade union movement for a ceiling on wages unless you are also prepared to guarantee a floor. The floor is made up of a number of dimensions, including underpinning award conditions. That will now be eroded by the changes to the Industrial Relations Act that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) will introduce, and it has always been underpinned by the social wage aspects&mdash;such as superannuation, Medicare and transfer payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are delivering distribution benefits to the trade union movement in ways other than money wages, then of course you can have more moderate money wage claims and outcomes. But if you cut away the ability to deliver benefits through that and indeed cut the benefits themselves, as we will see happen in this budget, then the trade union movement in this country will have no option but to pursue its claims through one avenue alone: money wages. There is no safety valve left. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, I take this opportunity to congratulate you on your election to your office. The MPI today refers to `the impact of interest rates and Australia's economic outlook of the government's decision to abandon the accord and wages policy'. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="178"> It is going to be great; absolutely terrific. Under the former Labor government we did not have a wages policy; we had a self-interest policy. What was good for the ACTU was believed to be good for the nation and the economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will quote a couple of sources. The first source is Jennie George in 1994. This was near the time the former minister for industrial relations, the honourable member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith (Mr Brereton), had been comprehensively rolled by the ACTU Congress back in November 1993. He was putting up a whole new program of industrial relations reform, which included the infamous unfair dismissal rule and which gave the unions increased power over the negotiating and bargaining system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Jennie put it well; she said, `What the employers have got to understand is that they lost the election and we won it.' The unions won the election; the ACTU won the election. We did not have a wages policy; we had a self-interest policy in the interest of trade unions and their peak council, the ACTU. I have another source. The shadow minister for employment and training, Martin Ferguson, who is at the table, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At every opportunity, the union movement will go out of its way to make the development of non-union agreements difficult.</PARA>
<PARA>He said this is to his own ex-government. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are not going to lay doggo and let non-union agreements develop.</PARA>
<PARA>If we do not finally get around to doing a bit about this thing we call micro-economic reform in this country, we are going to continue to have interest rate problems, which go on to exacerbate our current account deficit and the huge, untenable foreign debt that we have accumulated after 13 years under Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today in question time the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said that there are two facets of reducing the current account deficit; there are two things that we must do if we are going to get rid of this systemic problem. One of those is to try to encourage Australians to do more about saving, and that is in a personal sense. We on this side of the House will do something about the problem in a government <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sense by reducing the Commonwealth's demands on public savings through reduced Commonwealth spending.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other side of the equation is that we have to do something about industry in this country. We consume far too much from overseas. We do not produce enough of what Australians want to use. I remind the House that in 1992-93 the deficit of trade in manufacturing goods totalled $35 billion. I just recently produced figures for 1994-95 of an all-time national record of a $43 billion net deficit in trade in manufactured goods in this country. That is an outstanding record for a Labor government that was in power for 13 years!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was a government that kept talking the entire time about employment. They talked about the needs of workers and the need for people to have jobs. What do we have? One of the highest unemployment rates in the industrialised world, the highest current account deficit in the industrialised world and this huge pall of national debt hanging over our heads every day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The interest rate problem is significant because we pay high interest rates. We pay higher interest rates than we ought to because of our debt position, and that simply feeds upon itself. So we borrow money to pay interest on the debt that we have already accumulated. Somebody has to do something about that. Development of a wages policy of the kind adopted by the Labor government, which is beholden to the ACTU and the other unions, is not one that this side of the House will ever contemplate because it did not work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The standard of living of Australians fell during those 13 years. You kept a clamp on wages so that the living standards of Australians could not rise. You did that because they could not contribute to productivity improvements and because the agenda was set by the ACTU. The agenda was set by the unions, not by the employees and employers working together to try to do things in a more modern way. Look at the nonsense we saw at Robe River. If five flavours of ice-cream were not provided at the canteen, everybody went home for the day. That kind of nonsense was written into comprehensive awards, as was <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="179"> demonstrated by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) during question time today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of these awards encompass such archaic and antiquated provisions that they defy imagination. What we are talking about is simplifying those awards so that they become a core set of conditions that apply to a particular employment area. That is important because they will act as a safety net and they will make sure that people have, at base, a very reasonable standard of living. Beyond that, it is important that employers and employees work together to demonstrate and to prove up employment practices that actually lead to real productivity improvement. Then the gains can be shared amongst business, companies, industry and employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is nonsense that our living standards have to fall in order to have what the Labor Party and the ACTU call a wages policy&mdash;a nonsense which must disappear from our vocabulary. I take the point that the Treasurer (Mr Costello) made today. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) is starting to distance this small opposition in the federal House of Representatives from the union movement. Why is he starting to do that? Because he knows in his own mind that every time they tried to implement good policy and good procedures the ACTU, which had a voice at the cabinet table, pulled the strings. The ACTU played the puppet and said, `No, you don't do it this way; you do it our way.' So the government was hamstrung frequently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Back in April of 1993, we had the so-called historic win that Labor never expected to have, where Paul Keating knocked off John Hewson. On 21 April the then Prime Minister went to Melbourne and spoke to the Institute of Company Directors. He said some very important things. In describing a new model of industrial relations that he was working towards, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a model which places primary emphasis on bargaining at the workplace level within a framework of minimum standards provided by arbitration tribunals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a model under which compulsorily arbitrated awards and arbitrated wage increases would be there only as a safety net. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>Importantly, he went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we have laws which give the AIRC a role and powers that are not well suited to the present system we are trying to create.</PARA>
<PARA>So what happened? The former Prime Minister, Paul Keating, got busy with other affairs of state. Bill Kelty and Lindsay Fox went out into the countryside looking for jobs for young people&mdash;which was an admirable exercise&mdash;but they took their eye off the ball. The unions went absolutely mad when they realised what their industrial relations minister was going to do. Even Keating had a vision of what might happen, but the unions said no and the ACTU said no. That is this opposition's idea of a wages policy. The unions now represent only 33 per cent of the entire Australian work force and only 25 per cent of the private sector work force in Australia. That has come down very dramatically over the 13 years of a failed Labor government. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this bill, and the associated Dairy Produce Amendment Bill 1996, is to introduce minor but necessary amendments to ensure consistency between the current industry milk payment practices and the dairy market support legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations, Australia introduced new arrangements from 1 July 1995 which deliver assistance to dairy producers through a clearly defined and transparent domestic support scheme.  </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="180">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The market support arrangements involve a levy on market milk, paid by producers; and a levy on manufacturing milk, paid by manufacturers of dairy products which can be recouped from domestic consumers. Exports of manufactured dairy products are exempt from levy liability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The two levies are appropriated to the Australian Dairy Corporation, which pays support to manufacturing milk producers. The Australian Dairy Corporation also collects the levies as the agent of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scheme centres around being able to distinguish between market milk and manufacturing milk at the point of receival from a producer. The distinction between market milk and manufacturing milk under the current legislation is based on actual usage. Current administration of the scheme by the Australian Dairy Corporation is on the basis of industry milk payment practices and is not consistent with the legislation as it now stands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Extensive consultation with the dairy industry has established that it would be extremely difficult for the industry to modify its current milk payment practices without causing major disruption. Accordingly, this bill retrospectively aligns the market support legislation with the existing administration arrangements of the Australian Dairy Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill provides for market milk to be redefined as that milk for which a producer receives a market milk payment. Manufacturing milk will subsequently be the residual of total leviable milk less market milk. These definitional changes will ensure that the legislative framework and the current method of administration of the dairy support arrangements are compatible. They have been developed in close consultation with the dairy industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Two additional modifications have been incorporated into the bill. The first involves removing the imposition of the corporation, promotion and research levies on milk which is consumed, disposed of or lost on&hyphen;farm. In practice, the amounts of such milk are indeterminate and have consequently never in curred levy. The removal of the levy liability from such milk gives legal effect to industry policy and the reality of industry practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second modification clarifies the levy imposition arrangements for modified market milk and manufacturing milk by emphasising that levy is calculated on the milk fat and protein content of milk as determined on&hyphen;farm. Again this provision ensures consistency between established industry policy and the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed amendments do not affect actual levy collection and support payments, as current industry practice will continue. No producer or manufacturer will be disadvantaged relative to the current operation of the scheme. Furthermore, there will be no effect on the annual amounts of revenue and outlays under the scheme. Most importantly, the market support arrangements remain consistent with the original policy intention of the scheme and with Australia's commitments to the World Trade Organisation agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a couple of other points that I want to make. The first is to acknowledge the unbelievable performance of the Australian dairy industry in recent times. It has become the very model of a success story in terms of Australia's value added export sector. Not only has its performance in Asia outstripped the average performance of any other sector within the Australian economy, but even within agriculture, as I hope is well known in this House, the primary industry sector has shown a clean set of heels to the rest of the Australian economy. We need to commend it for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="181"> The second point I want to make is to record my absolute delight at being able to carry through this place the first piece of legislation under the new administration. It is the first piece of legislation put through by a coalition government for 13 years. That is indeed an honour and something in which I take enormous pride, not only on my own behalf but on behalf of my colleagues as well. I see that the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp) is to follow me.

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this bill is to give effect to the government's pre&hyphen;election commitments to repeal the International Shipping (Australian&hyphen;resident Seafarers) Grants Act 1995 and the Ships (Capital Grants Act) 1987. These measures will save Australian taxpayers about $52 million over the next four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition strongly opposed the International Shipping (Australian&hyphen;resident Seafarers) Grants Bill when it was debated in the parliament last October. I remind the House of how this scheme developed from the deal made by the former Prime Minister and his senior ministerial colleagues, with the ACTU and the Maritime Union of Australia, to end the shipping strike called by the Maritime Union of Australia over the sale of ANL Limited and ANL's shareholding in Australian Stevedores.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For its part of the bargain, the MUA undertook to give serious consideration to supporting the government's proposed sale of ANL and negotiating an industrial agreement with shipowners to deliver significant cost savings. Well, we all know the story on ANL: the MUA opposed the sale tooth and nail and forced the government to back off from selling the line to P&amp;O, the only prospective buyer. Needless to say, ANL made further losses which continued to be a drain on the Australian taxpayer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for the industrial agreement, the so&hyphen;called maritime industry restructuring agreement, or MIRA, was duly negotiated and was supposed to produce cost savings of some $200,000 per ship per year. However, the MUA has largely failed to deliver on its commitments, with the result that the promised savings have simply evaporated.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="182">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the key elements of MIRA was for the industry to reduce the crewing factor from around 2.13 seafarers per berth to 2.0 by changes in work practices, improvements in safety and cutting out workers' compensation rorts. However, the quarterly survey by the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics shows that over the 12 months to December 1995 the crewing factor worsened rather than improved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another key element of MIRA was for a peace accord to maintain an environment to minimise industrial disruption. Yet late last year, at the behest of its mates in the ACTU, the MUA took national strike action in support of a few mining industry workers at Weipa. In short, the MUA, despite the peace accord, was happy to damage its own industry and the nation as a whole in a political gesture to the power brokers of the ACTU who would rather have the MUA flex its industrial muscle than use the proper processes in the Industrial Relations Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The evidence is there for all to see. The international shipping grants package has not delivered its complementary MIRA reforms; it has simply provided a windfall gain of $19 million to existing operators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now turn to the repeal of the Ships (Capital Grants) Act 1987. This scheme was introduced in 1987 with an intended five&hyphen;year life. In the words of the then minister, the Hon. Peter Morris, when introducing the bill, the legislation was to assist Australian ship operators to acquire modern, technologically advanced ships which could be operated at lower crewing levels. The scheme was subsequently extended another five years to June 1997. Hand in hand with this grant scheme went a generous accelerated depreciation tax concession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to these generous subsidies and tax concessions, there has been the financial assistance to the industry through the previous government's shared funding of early retirement and voluntary redundancy packages for MUA members. The total value of all these measures over the past nine years is estimated to have been in excess of $320 million.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the crew levels on Australian ships are now equivalent to international standards, the crewing factor of around 2.13, which is largely accounted for by the most generous leave system of any maritime nation, is well above the international average of around 1.7. The industry is also saddled with a costly and inefficient pooled employment system for MUA members which gives employers no right to select the most suitable, appropriately trained ratings for their shipping operations. This pooled labour system, more fitting to the 1920s than the 1990s, also denies employers the opportunity of creating a strong company ethos among staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These factors, coupled with the high wages paid to Australian seafarers, means that Australian shipping is no nearer to being internationally competitive than it was nine years ago. The Australian taxpayer cannot be expected to continue pouring capital grants into shipping when it has failed to address the serious problems impeding its development as an efficient and competitive world&hyphen;class industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to the winding&hyphen;up of the ships capital grants scheme, a bill will shortly be introduced to repeal the related accelerated depreciation provisions under section 57AM of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. However, consistent with established practice when tax concessions are withdrawn, transitional arrangements will enable those ships that would have qualified for the capital grant had the scheme continued for the further 12 months to still qualify for the accelerated depreciation concession. This is provided that they continue to meet the compliance criteria set out in the Ships (Capital Grants) Act 1987 and are delivered to the shipowner and registered in Australia before 1 July 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now turn to the details of the bill. The key elements of the bill are contained in schedule 1 to the bill. Item 1 of the schedule repeals the International Shipping (Australian&hyphen;resident Seafarers) Grants Act 1995. In accordance with clause 2 of the bill, the repeal of the act is to take effect on 1 July 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Item 2 of the schedule provides for the continuation of the International Shipping (Australian&hyphen;resident Seafarers) Grants Act in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="183"> respect of entitlements accrued under the act up to and including 30 June 1996. Item 3 of the schedule amends the sunset provision in the Ships (Capital Grants) Act 1987 with the effect that a grant will not be payable if the ship is delivered to the shipowner or registered in Australia after 30 June 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the government has already begun consulting the shipping industry on other elements of the shipping policy reforms foreshadowed before the general election. These include such matters as the possible establishment of a second register&hyphen;type structure for Australian shipping.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Second register structures have been adopted by a number of traditional shipping nations to provide their shipping the opportunity to compete on similar terms with flag of convenience shipping. The government is examining whether a second register structure in Australia could provide the impetus to the Australian shipping industry to become internationally competitive, something that the massive subsidies paid out over the past decade by the previous Labor governments has singularly failed to deliver.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, I would conclude my remarks today by taking this opportunity to congratulate you on your election as the Second Deputy Speaker of the parliament. I know that you will carry out the task extremely well and in a fair and unbiased fashion. I wish you all the very best in your role. I would like to think that in the role you now have you will continue to perform in a similar fashion to the way you did when you were on the other side of the House before this parliament commenced.

The definition is necessary for determining the periods of a year for the purposes of calculating the excise duty on crude petroleum oil under three sections of the Tariff Act.

At some other time I will take the opportunity of congratulating the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker. Obviously, a lot of people believe that the only role of the Speaker is when he is in the chair. Being a former Speaker myself, I am aware that there are other duties that take up a considerable amount of your time. I wish you well and I hope you enjoy your position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I represent the Country Liberal Party in the Northern Territory and I would refer honourable members to the fact sheet which was distributed by the officers of the parliament. When you see the breakdown of the members of this parliament, you will see that the Country Liberal Party is listed as a single item with a total of one member. I am the coalition member representing the Country Liberal Party in the House of Representatives. Of course, we do have a senator who is a member of the Country Liberal Party. I refer to Senator Grant Tambling who has been in the Senate for a number of years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must advise you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the Country Liberal Party in the Northern Territory is one of Australia's most successful political parties. It was elected to power at the first Northern Territory Assembly elections in 1974 and has been in power for those 22 years. At the conclusion of its current term in 1998 it will probably become the longest serving political party of any state government in Australia.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Country Liberal Party was very instrumental in my being elected to this parliament. Without the party's help and that of its members in the branches throughout the Northern Territory I would not be here today. I must thank each and every member of the Country Liberal Party who worked very hard to ensure my success. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank my electorate for having faith in me in terms of representing them at this very, very interesting time of Northern Territory constitutional change and development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously, I have had some previous experience in parliament by being a member of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. I was a member of what we called the class of 1974. I retired from that parliament in 1994 to take time out to recharge my batteries and to seek preselection and, hopefully, once I had preselection, to go on and win the seat. I am happy to say that I did receive preselection in May 1995. I worked very hard with a lot of my former colleagues in the Northern Territory. Obviously I was successful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The important thing is the Northern Territory's profile in terms of where we are today. The Northern Territory is 1.3 million square kilometres large. It is the largest electorate in terms of electors in the Australian region. I have 97,000&hyphen;plus on my electoral roll. That makes it the largest electorate in that sense. In terms of land mass, I know that the seat of Kalgoorlie&mdash;which stretches from the Great Australian Bight to the Kimberleys&mdash;is the largest electorate in Australia when calculated in land mass. But tonight, I would like to claim that the Northern Territory electorate, with its boundaries, is the largest in Australia by virtue of the fact that there is a water boundary from the coast of Western Australia to the Indian Ocean island territories which are part of the Northern Territory federal electoral boundaries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The aspirations of the territorians are really that we have security, growth, progress, new wealth, protection, an enhancement of our lifestyle, a good standard of living, a future for our children and a society that recognises the rights of individuals.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="185">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, the Northern Territory has probably one of the best examples of multiculturalism. The Northern Territory is made up of many ethnic communities&mdash;totalling more than 60. When moving around the Northern Territory, it is not difficult to realise that 51 per cent of the population born in the Northern Territory are non-Anglo&hyphen;Saxon. Considering that 25 per cent of Northern Territorians are Aboriginal and indigenous, it certainly does give us the best mix in what we would consider to be a rich mix of cultures in the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have a young population. Some say that 60 per cent of the population of the Northern Territory is under the age of 40, and some 70 per cent of that group is under the age of 25. So we must be mindful when we try to formulate our policies and we must make sure that the considerations of the young are taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we speak about the young, we obviously speak about the young people who are working in the Northern Territory and the two&hyphen;income families who have great problems and difficulties with child-care places. I am told by constituents that, if you have two children in your family and you want to get those children into the same child-care centre, you have a better chance of winning Tattslotto. I think that is disgraceful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, we can identify with the fact that, within the next three to five years, some 500 people in the Northern Territory will require additional aged care facilities, whether they be by way of hospices, villages or clinics. The important thing, I believe, is that we need to establish more facilities for our senior citizens, and that is something that I will be working very, very hard to achieve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we do not keep our senior citizens in the territory, they will leave and, because of the extended family situation in the territory, they will take their families with them to other parts of Australia. At the same time, I am aware that the Chief Minister, Shane Stone, is having very serious discussions with our Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) to try to work out a particular program to encourage migration to the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot of you who were members of parliament years ago might have remembered when Ian Macphee was the federal minister for immigration. He tried to put in a scheme&mdash;which in those days was called the NUMAS scheme&mdash;to encourage migration to remote parts of Australia, including the Northern Territory, the northern part of Western Australia and, I think, even Tasmania. He tried to get more people to go to those areas. Without that sort of population growth, the Northern Territory would have obviously taken a lot longer to develop. My job is to use my best endeavours to make sure that the aspirations of the territory are met.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That brings me to statehood. Of course, constitutional changes started in 1974 with our first fully elected parliament, of which I was a member. The first major constitutional changes started in 1978 when we were given self-government. We were then able to make determinations and decisions in the Northern Territory, because we were territorians elected to represent other territorians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1996, some 22 years later, the advent of statehood has certainly been deterred, I believe, by the last 13 years of Labor government. We were given some encouragement in 1975 when the Prime Minister of Australia, the Hon. Malcolm Fraser, said at that time that the Northern Territory could have statehood within five years. Of course, being new in terms of where we were going towards constitutional development, we said, `No. We don't think that timetable is a good timetable. We will need more time to establish our bona fides before we move into that final stage.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have been treated as a state in a financial sense since 1988, so that does not inhibit us from moving forward. Of course, economic development&mdash;which I hope to be able to speak about a bit more tonight&mdash;has certainly given the Northern Territory a great impetus for that final stage of constitutional change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The biggest factor that not so much confuses people but makes them hesitant is that they are asked, `If you become a state, do you want 12 senators?' With a population of 185,000 in the Northern Territory, it would be quite unrealistic to expect at statehood that we should finish up with 12 senators. At the time, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="186"> my predecessor in this place did say in his maiden speech that, when the territory becomes a state, we should not have fewer senators than the other states. I believe that he may have been wrong in that assumption.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we go back and look at when Australia became a federation in 1901, we see that each of the states were given six senators, and I believe that the Northern Territory should start by having at least six senators. The reasoning behind that idea of our forefathers was that, by granting six senators to the smaller states with a smaller population base, the bigger states would not be able to kick them around.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1996 there is talk about a constitutional change and statehood for the territory by the year 2001. I believe that is too far away and we could put programs in place before then. I am told that section 121 of the constitution will allow this parliament to give the Northern Territory statehood, provided we can reach an arrangement in Senate representation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the territory should not start with fewer than six senators. Then a timetable&mdash;whether it be gauged on growth or population&mdash;could be put in place to allow the territory to reach its full maturity in representation. It is not a matter of if; it is now a matter of when. I certainly hope that the timetable is accelerated before the year 2001.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the legislative process in the Northern Territory, we are subject to the power of veto by the Commonwealth. We have been since 1974. I am happy to say that in the last 22 years not one piece of legislation passed by territorians has ever been rejected by the Commonwealth. In 1901 the states all had six senators. We were part of South Australia in 1901. In 1910 the South Australians could not handle the development of the north and they gave it back. The territory was formulated in 1911 and we have been under Commonwealth control since then. The Northern Territory, with one&hyphen;sixth of the Australian land mass, should be a state before the year 2001. I would be very proud if I could be the House of Representatives member who tabled the constitution for the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Land rights, obviously, is a very important issue in the Northern Territory. My position will be to influence policy development and to have a legislative program in favour of economic and social development in the Northern Territory, remembering that 40 per cent of Australia's export income is generated north of the Tropic of Capricorn. I was very pleased to see that the Governor-General in his speech yesterday said that the Commonwealth government would make sure that our indigenous communities are part of that development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Native title has not worked. Two years have passed and some $30 million has been spent and we are still unsure of where we are going. I acknowledge that during the election campaign the coalition foreshadowed that it was going to amend the Native Title Act. I am pleased to say that in the Governor-General's speech it has been foreshadowed that amendments are going to take place to native title. That is very important because there is a lot of confusion in the remote parts of the Northern Territory and in other parts of Australia. People are looking for a finalisation of this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have two land councils in the Northern Territory&mdash;the Northern Land Council and the Central Land Council. It divides the territory in half. I think it is wrong. It is now time to establish smaller land councils. Aboriginal communities want smaller land councils so they can determine their own future and wellbeing. A large land council in the Top End dictates what happens in half of the Northern Territory. I invite honourable members who have never been to the Northern Territory to come and see for themselves first-hand the implications of the very large areas we have. Aboriginals in some parts of the territory cannot talk about land in another part of the territory which is not part of them. Land, for Aboriginals, is their mother. If I live in one section of the Northern Territory and I am part of a land council I really should not be talking about other parts of that land as far as they are concerned. Smaller land councils will ensure far greater development in terms of land ownership.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="187">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to Kakadu and Uluru. Obviously I am not going to have time to finish what I have set out to do today. I will probably use the grievance debate to pick up other points that I do not get through tonight. With Kakadu and Uluru we are talking about management of those two parks. We are not talking about ownership. The Northern Territory Parks and Wildlife Service have good management models. I believe they have done an excellent job since 1978. Katherine, which is the major national park, is on Aboriginal land and the Katherine Gorge is managed by the Northern Territory Parks and Wildlife Service. Territorians do not understand why Canberra wants to run our parks. Can't we be trusted? We believe we can. We know that we must consult with traditional owners both at Kakadu and Uluru.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are 4.7 million hectares of park in the Northern Territory and 2.1 million of those are just Uluru and Kakadu. There are 12 other parks in the remainder, which the Northern Territory government controls and runs very well through its parks and wildlife service. The maintenance of these large parks is an enormous problem. My advice is that Kakadu is deteriorating under federal supervision. Some waterways are becoming polluted with an introduced feral aquatic plant, salvina molesta. There is also mimosa pigra. A feral pig program also needs great attention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Northern Territory government has its own programs. Kakadu, with its area and waterways, and other waterways are controlled by the Northern Territory government. If they are working on these problems in our waterways and if at the same time that is not happening in Kakadu, then everybody is wasting their time. There needs to be a coordinated approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, you may remember a headline about my wanting to go out to the tollbooth with a sledgehammer. Symbolically speaking, that is what I wanted to do because tollbooths in the parks, as far as we are concerned, are not the way to go if we are going to encourage tourism. But let me talk about ANCA. In 1975 ANCA started in this country with a staff of six and a budget of just over $1 million. In 1996, expenditure on <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Kakadu and Uluru is some $8 million&mdash;just to run those two parks. The total budget for the territory, as I understand it, is about $23 million. The whole budget for ANCA in 1994-95 was $75 million, and plus the $11 million that it collects makes a total of $85 million. It now has some 460 officers, of whom 349 are full-time. In regard to the aid spent on those parks, the Northern Territory could do a far better job with its National Parks and Wildlife Service than ANCA.  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us talk about uranium and get one thing straight. The uranium province was there before the park was established. We have not tried to establish a uranium mine in Kakadu. It was in the South Alligator Rivers Region and the park came afterwards. ERA has been there since 1974. Kakadu was not declared until 1979. The Jabiluka and Koongarra mines are still out of the park, but there seems to be some worry about them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very happy that the coalition has said that it is going to abandon the uranium three&hyphen;mine policy. This will help the Northern Territory. We know that our Commonwealth brother, Canada, is able to mine uranium. It is able to take advantage of the market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the exports out of the Northern Territory. Some $1.46 billion worth of exports came out of the Northern Territory in 1994-95. One per cent of Australia's population, which is about 180,000 people, supplies the Australian community with two per cent of GDP. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate you, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, on being elected Deputy Speaker. I am quite sure that you will do a fantastic job.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset, I congratulate you, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, on your election to this very high office. I look forward to having the opportunity of saying likewise to the Speaker and the Second Deputy Speaker. May I also say at this point how much I have enjoyed hearing the speeches from the other new members <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="188"> who have proceeded me&mdash;the members for Gilmore (Mrs Gash), Longman (Mr Brough), Macarthur (Mr Fahey), Moreton (Mr Hardgrave) and the Northern Territory (Mr Dondas). I now know how they felt when they stood.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is with a great sense of privilege that I rise in this chamber today. It was one of my proudest moments when I was sworn in as the first member for Namadgi yesterday. It is not very often that a member has the opportunity to be an electorate's first representative and I am aware of the special responsibilities that come with that task.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Namadgi is the Aboriginal name for the mountains south&hyphen;west of Canberra. For those who are unfamiliar with the new electoral boundaries in the ACT, Namadgi consists of the whole of Tuggeranong, the south Woden suburbs of Chifley, Pearce, Torrens, Mawson, Isaacs and Farrer, as well as the remainder of the ACT to south and west of the Murrumbidgee River.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Namadgi area has a very rich heritage. A rock shelter just north of the Namadgi National Park contains evidence that Aboriginal people were living in the region during the last ice age around 20,000 years ago. The first pastoralists settled in the valleys at the southern end of the Namadgi Park in the 1830s. They faced a struggle to establish themselves in a remote area subject to severe weather.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The area is now home to a population of nearly 90,000 people. Each one of these people has a stake in the future of their community and I see it as a fundamental part of my role as their federal member to represent the very diverse range of interests in the community and service the needs of my constituents. But to me that is not quite enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe it is important to have a vision in politics. It is not sufficient to say, as a politician, `I am here and I want to represent the community,' because by definition that is what we are elected and paid to do. It is our job. What must come with wanting to represent that community is a vision and a firm belief in how and why.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to represent the community through the Australian Labor Party because I believe in the philosophy of the party&mdash;social justice, equality, human rights, compassion and assistance to those in need. This is the philosophy the party was founded on out of the trade union movement over 100 years ago. I believe in progress and change but for the good of the whole community. I believe in the rights of all individuals not just those who are rich and powerful or have the loudest voices. I am here because the ordinary people must have a voice in parliament. That is why I represent the community as a member of the ALP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I see it as my major responsibility in this place to ensure quality representation for the people of the electorate of Namadgi. I can assure them of dedication and hard work on their behalf. I will be accessible and always ready and willing to hear their views and be their voice in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) gave a commitment during  the election campaign that he would govern for all Australians. I would like to ask the honourable member: what has happened to that promise? It certainly has yet to be demonstrated clearly in Namadgi. I have given an absolute commitment to represent all the residents of my electorate and I call on the Prime Minister to restate his commitment to govern for all of the Australian population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a long association with the Namadgi area, both professionally and at a personal level. As a result, I have had the privilege in participating in the growth and development of one of the fastest growing urban areas in Australia. My electorate is like any other urban electorate in the country. It shares the same problems and its residents have the same aspirations for themselves and their families. I believe that the Namadgi electorate embodies the spirit of modern day Canberra. It was not so long ago that Canberra was limestone plains, but now in a relatively short time Canberra has developed into a modern and diverse community. The Namadgi area has likewise developed in this fashion. It is part of the whole, but a very distinct part.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="189">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very proud that my electorate encompasses the Namadgi National Park. Namadgi was proclaimed a national park in 1984. It covers 94,000 hectares or almost half of the Australian Capital Territory and is the most northerly alpine environment in Australia. Its tallest mountain, Bimberi Peak, is only 318 metres below Australia's highest, Mount Kosciusko. Given the proximity of our rapidly developing urban areas to the national park and the distinctive nature of the electorate, careful and balanced development must take place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only do we have the highest proportion of young families of any electorate in Australia making their homes in Namadgi but also a rapidly increasing teenage population, along with a small but growing proportion of older citizens. The growth of the teenage population presents challenges for policy makers in the next few years. These kids have expectations that their city will be able to provide them with challenging and relevant employment in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Tuggeranong Town Centre is beginning to develop into a healthy work base for the electorate. Large public sector employers, such as the Department of Social Security and the Health Insurance Commission, have provided the centre with a much needed employment boost. As a direct result of this strong public sector growth, the electorate now has a variety of retail, commercial and community facilities that meet the demands of an ever&hyphen;growing population. However, with a target population still to reach of around 100,000, continued development is essential to ensure growth into the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the election the emphasis has turned from a probable increase of that employment base through the development of a Commonwealth department office complex in that town centre to a fight to maintain the Commonwealth work base we have. The electors of Namadgi expect no more or less than what the Canberra plan promised them years ago in its formulation&mdash;a full and viable employment base in their own local region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the ACT the strength and the viability of the private sector is more dependent on the public sector and government decisions than <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> any other city in the nation. The growth of small and medium business in this town is reliant on certainty and stability in the public sector. With just under half the ACT's work force employed in the public sector, the current speculation surrounding that public sector is causing, quite justifiably, considerable concern among the residents of Canberra. Given this prevailing climate, it comes as no surprise that economic activity in the ACT is stalling and, in some areas, moving rapidly into reverse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Throughout the recent federal election campaign the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) travelled the country championing the cause of small business and the need to raise the standards of honesty and accountability in government. What must the small business people of the ACT be thinking right now? Recent statements by the Canberra Business Council and the ACT Liberal government confirm the extreme concern of local business at the federal government's plans for the ACT. One only need acknowledge the full page advertisement in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> placed by the Canberra Business Council to understand that level of concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The speculation, the anxiety and the degree of uncertainty could be ended today by this government. Make no mistake, the coalition government's plans for this town and this community will create, I fear, an economic and social disaster. The coalition has shown a punitive, short&hyphen;sighted attitude towards the Public Service time and time again, as history is testimony to. Cast your mind back to the last time they were in government. The results of the Lynch razor gang sadly still hang strongly in our local memory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the election campaign, I gave numerous warnings that, once elected, a coalition government would cut much further than they were letting on. The electors of Namadgi believed me and they voted for me. I recall that my comments were treated with derision at the time and I was accused by many of scaremongering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It amazes me that there is still a belief in the modern&hyphen;day coalition that genuine savings in government spending can be brought about <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="190"> through reducing Public Service numbers. It may be politically expedient to talk about cutting back government spending by reducing the number of public servants, but, as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) has pointed out on many occasions recently, the Public Service wages bill makes up only a very small component of total public sector outlay. So the scope for significant savings is minimal, but the impact of those savings is widespread. The government has offered no explanation of the link between public sector cutbacks and national prosperity. It seems to believe that one person's job loss is another person's tax cut.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst I am not advocating protection of the Public Service for the sake of it, I strongly believe in the need to maintain a Public Service which is efficient, professional and driven by a high standard of service delivery. The Labor government undertook significant reform of the Public Service, increasing productivity and efficiency. The Service is to be congratulated for the way in which it adapted to meet the former government's reforms. In contrast, the coalition's approach appears to be driven by a narrow focus on that dollar bottom line. The result of this approach will be inefficiencies and a diminution of the previously very high standards. Morale in the service will be severely affected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have always believed that whenever there is a need to reduce job numbers it must be done with levels of service delivery as the paramount concern. The question I put to the new government is this: at what cost to the community are these public sector savings being made? That is the aspect of the equation that the government appears to ignore. There is no doubt that the cost will be increased workloads and excessive demands on individual public servants. But what of the reduction in the quality and type of community service, that is, the service to our community? Surely any responsible government would see the absolute arrogance of making substantial cuts to the Public Service without even publicly acknowledging their impact. Implementing destructive policy in complete isolation of the consequences typifies the sort <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of narrow vision that will guide this government through the course of its term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government must also publicly recognise that people will be directly affected by these cuts. When we speak of these effects, we are not referring to a list of undefinable values in the middle of an equation or a balance sheet. We are not simply talking about proposed targets for a departmental head to meet. We are talking about thousands of men and women throughout the country who will no longer have a job to go to because the government of the day believes that the only way to meet a budget target based on inexact forward estimates is to simply throw people out of work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With all the attention on Canberra, people fail to realise the impact these cuts will have in regional Australia. Contrary to popular belief, the government of Australia is not all in Canberra. In fact, only about one in five Commonwealth employees is based in the ACT. Quite often, the Commonwealth public servants employed in regional areas help to form the backbone of their local community. They are the ones who actively participate in their local community&mdash;the school fetes and the sporting events. They spend their incomes in their local region. I wonder whether three of my colleagues on the other side&mdash;the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer), the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) and the honourable member for Eden&hyphen;Monaro (Mr Nairn) are aware of the social and economic effects on their electorates if, for example, the local CES or DSS offices are closed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be cynical to suggest that the government's silence on the ramifications of its approach to the Public Service indicates a lack of ideas on its part as to how to deal with the effects of such a decision. I take it as given that a responsible government would at least be prepared to deal with the consequences of its actions. I hope, for the sake of the people in my electorate and others who will suffer the inevitable effects, that my cynicism is unfounded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the federal government single&hyphen;mindedly concerned with returning the budget to the black, and the ACT Liberal government <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="191"> worried only about obtaining compensation to prop up its bottom line, who is going to be looking out for those really affected by the cutbacks&mdash;the families, the single parents, the pensioners, the students and those with a disability or a chronic illness? What happens when they start to fall through the cracks that will inevitably appear when the effects on service delivery occur?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In tough economic times there seems to be a propensity for the conservative side of politics to shamelessly perpetuate the myth that the Canberra community is somehow exempt from the pain felt in the rest of the country. Canberra is a city no different from any other in Australia. We are not spoilt, elitist or sterile. My electorate is the same as any other in the country. In fact, I invite all honourable members in this place to make the time to drive the 30 or 40 kilometres down to the southern urban areas of my electorate to get a true picture of my constituency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Canberra is made up of ordinary Australians with expectations and needs that are found in all other communities in the country. We are concerned about our future and this nation's future. We are concerned about unemployment, the health and wellbeing of our families, the education of our children, the environment in which we live and the immense problems that can, and in fact do, face our youth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the national capital, there is no doubt that we enjoy the facilities that come with that role. However, Canberra is also a place where people live. I do not believe we should have to apologise for living here. We may have the facilities that a modern day city provides but we also have the same social problems&mdash;family separation, youth homelessness, unemployment, drug abuse and poverty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Too often it is convenient for interstate politicians, and particularly the media, to score cheap political points by attacking Canberrans. I strongly object to any imputations that Canberrans, particularly those employed in the public sector, are living off the rest of the country. Those who simplistically attack the Public Service should remember that the Public Service provides services to the whole Australian community&mdash;valuable <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> services such as social security, defence, veterans' affairs and so on. These are services that only the public sector can and should provide. In a time when the community feels increasingly cynical about the process of government, an adequately staffed professional public service forges an undeniable link between government and the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, our local community is now wondering, given that the Prime Minister has decided to operate primarily from Sydney, whether the print newspaper headlines over the next few years may thunder `Sydney to cut pensions and benefits', `Sydney to shed 25,000 jobs' and so on. I suspect not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot has been said recently about the limited number of female members of parliament. As I look around this chamber, I am particularly pleased to see that the number of women parliamentarians has increased from previous parliaments. However, both sides of politics need to be aware that more must be done. It is simply not good enough for one side or the other to grandstand about which has more women members. Until women have equal representation in this parliament as a matter of course, the problem is not resolved; the true meaning of full and proper representation of the community will not have been achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the ACT both the Labor and Liberal parties have a proud record of supporting women candidates. Among the ALP women are the former ACT senator Susan Ryan, who was the first female Labor cabinet minister; Ros Kelly, who also served as a cabinet minister; former ACT Chief Minister Rosemary Follett, who was the first female to head a government in Australia; and, more recently, our newly elected Senator Kate Lundy. The ACT Liberal Party has also actively promoted women candidates, the most notable of these being Senator Margaret Reid and ACT Chief Minister Kate Carnell.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During my term as a member of the ACT Legislative Assembly between 1992 and 1995, I was proud to be a member of a Labor government that in fact had equal numbers of males and females in its caucus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In finishing, I would like to thank all the residents of the electorate of Namadgi for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="192"> giving me this unique opportunity. I must also thank particularly the people of Tuggeranong Valley for their support. It was my professional and social involvement in Tuggeranong over many years that prompted me to seek elected office. I would like to thank all members and supporters of the Australian Labor Party, but in particular the members of the Lanyon, Tuggeranong and South Woden sub&hyphen;branches, for all their tireless work and dedication which made my election possible. Unfortunately, there are too many to name individually. However, I pay special tribute to my campaign director and friend, Mr John Hargreaves; my friend and former employer, Mr Terry Connolly; and of course my family. As we all know, it is primarily that level of support that gets us here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am looking forward to working with all of my colleagues in this federal parliament to ensure that Canberra continues to progress for the good of all Canberrans and, through that, for all Australians. Thank you.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, may I congratulate you on your election as Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives. I would also like to congratulate the Liberal and National parties on their victory&mdash;winning government. I wish Mr Howard and Mr Fischer, our Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister, well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, I address you today with humility, aware that a great responsibility rests on my shoulders. The mighty seat of Dawson, a rural and regional seat in North Queensland, the largest sugar seat in Australia, has chosen only its fourth member since the seat was proclaimed in 1949. The electorate chose the best man for the job, only this time the best man happened to be a woman.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Queensland National Party and the people of Dawson have also made political history, for it is my honour to be the first National Party woman to ever sit in the House of Representatives. It was a considerable leap <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of faith for the Queensland National Party and the people of Dawson to choose a woman to defend their industries and the people in North Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to tell you a little about Dawson. It stretches from Alligator Creek, south of Townsville, down the Queensland coast to Clairview. It takes in the mining towns of Collinsville and Glenden. The principal centre is Mackay, followed by Ayr, Home Hill, Bowen, Proserpine, Sarina and the glorious Whitsundays. Dawson pays its way. With only 0.7 per cent of Australia's population, it has four per cent of Australia's exports. A Dawson person is six times more effective in producing exports for this great country than is the average Australian. Dawson is the sweetest seat in Australia. Half of all Australia's sugar is grown in my seat and 80 per cent of that is exported.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any Treasurer who is feeling a little glum and a bit worried about the balance of trade will be heartened greatly by a visit to the mighty seat of Dawson because out of our ports of Dalrymple Bay and Hay Point, the coal&hyphen;handling facilities in Mackay, every year flows $2.4 billion worth of coal&mdash;3.4 per cent of the exports of our great Commonwealth. Dawson is the engine room of exports&mdash;sugar, beef, coal, horticulture and tourism&mdash;despite all the difficulties, such as droughts, lack of infrastructure and dependence on fluctuating commodity prices, that beset those who live in regional and rural areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to pause for a moment and tell you some of the difficulties that face the industries in Dawson. Our beef industry has now seen a dramatic fall in prices of 20 per cent. Soon that will be 30 per cent. I am also concerned about access for tourists to the mighty Whitsundays. If you have not had a holiday in North Queensland, do yourself a favour and come to the Whitsundays. It is absolutely magnificent there. But we have a difficulty because we do not have access to the tourist areas in Dawson. That is something that I have pledged to rectify while I am the federal member.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Water storage has been a considerable difficulty. Under the last 13 years of government we have seen very few major water <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="193"> storages go into what is a very dry part of Australia. The sugar industry is suffering paralysis by analysis. It has been examined by technocrats, bureaucrats and everybody else so many times that it is experiencing a period of paralysis. I hope that the technocrats, both federal and state, leave my mighty sugar industry alone so it can get on with doing what it does well&mdash;being one of the major exporters of sugar to the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, I have a gift for you today: North Queensland, 100 per cent Australian coffee, grown in Bowen. I understand from the people who have tasted this coffee that it is some of the finest coffee in Australia. I would like to present this to you later and I hope that you will enjoy it as a small memento of Dawson.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moving on to more serious matters, those of us who represent rural and regional areas are very few in number. It behoves us, therefore, when we are weak in number to be fierce in debate. I trust the House will understand the fierceness of our debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A seat is not just about economic factors and exports; it is the heart and soul of the people there. Dawson is very proud to have the largest percentage of Australian South Sea Islanders in any seat in Australia. These are the descendants of the Kanakas, the indentured labourers&mdash;some say slaves&mdash;who were brought out last century from the islands of the South Pacific to work in the sugar plantations. They are a tremendous people, very Christian in their faith and with strong family groups. They are very eager to take part, on their merits, in all the opportunities that our country offers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have many people of different heritage, notably Italian and Maltese. Many of those people arrived in this country with just a suitcase. They now have flourishing sugarcane properties which they built up by cutting cane by hand&mdash;up to about 10 tonnes a day. Believe me, that is harder work than any of us will ever do. They have given us a great cultural heritage in Dawson. We have the Australian&hyphen;South Sea Islander Cultural Hut, the Maltese festival&mdash;the only one in Australia&mdash;and the Tre Venizi in Burdekin, to name a few.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would now like to pay tribute to my predecessor, Mr Ray Braithwaite. Ray was the member for Dawson for 20 years. No matter where you travel around Dawson, you hear the same thing: Ray is honest, he works hard and he has great integrity. He made what I think is the greatest sacrifice any federal member can make for constituents: he gave up his personal ambitions for his electorate. In 1992 when Ray was the shadow minister for aged care, the coalition had a policy of reducing the sugar tariff to negligible levels by the year 2000. Ray resigned his shadow ministry for his electorate and set a standard of representation that I and many others can aspire to. Ray Braithwaite championed the cause of the Australian South Sea Islanders and worked for fairness for subcontractors. He was truly a great representative of the people of Dawson.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would now like to thank those who worked long and hard in my campaign. The wonderful Queensland National Party people organised meetings, rallies and fund&hyphen;raisers right across Dawson. Although I cannot name them all, there are some special people whom I would like to mention: Mr Ken Crooke, our state director; Sir Albert Abbott, whose faith in me never wavered; Mrs Eileen Deicke, a good friend and supporter; Jack Long; and Jim Wort.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, you could never do this job without the support of your family, and I am blessed to have a wonderful husband who has supported me through this campaign. I also have a dear little son, who is eight years old, called Ian. Whenever I became rather disheartened about the campaign and my opponents, he would say to me, `Don't worry, Mummy. They are in a rowboat and you're in a speedboat.' Fortunately, that turned out to be true.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very glad that my mother is here today and sad that my father could not be&mdash;except I hope in spirit. It is to my father, the late Ian Park, that I owe my character and convictions. I grew up on a cattle property. Dad believed that girls could do anything, and we sure did. We mustered, I built fences and we cut calves. It was a terrific childhood.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="194">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the beef crash of the 1970s, when cattlemen shot their cattle because they were not worth the freight to the meatworks, my father along with many others founded the Cattlemen's Union. In real terms the cattle industry is in the same situation now as it was in the 1970s. The difficulties are as profound. My father said that primary producers, by and large, could struggle through the bad seasons and the bad commodity prices, but the biggest threat they faced was political in terms of poor policy and political interference. I think that is as true now as it was then. My father taught me about true representation, that if you represent somebody you can never back down from pushing their concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would now like to mention somebody who has been a great inspiration to me: Lady Bjelke-Petersen, Florence, who was a senator for Queensland in parliament until recently and is of course the wife of Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen. Florence taught me some valuable lessons. She said that complex political problems could be looked at by simply asking: are they the right thing or are they the wrong thing? She also said that it is most important to keep faith with those who keep faith with you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would now like to speak about my political philosophy. I was very pleased to hear the Governor-General mention in his address yesterday the national interest. In recent times there has been a lot of talk of the public interest. I think that is a rather poor term to use. The national interest is what we should be concerning ourselves with, because the nation is not just a public, which is those who are living now. A nation is those who have defended and worked for our great country. It is those who are yet unborn. A nation is a contract between past, present and future Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would now like to mention a little about my view of how you do not build a nation and then what I believe does need to be done. You cannot build a nation by dividing its people with special privileges. You cannot build a nation by pitting the weak against the strong. Competition is sometimes exploitation. You cannot pit the metropolitan city against the regional centre or the country town. You </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA>cannot pit the chain store against the corner store. You cannot pit the international commodity traders against the small family farmer. You cannot build a nation by substituting the disorderly love and discipline of family life for the cold, structured care of the state. You cannot build a nation by substituting kindness and respect for life with the sterile computer&hyphen;generated use&hyphen;by date for human life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consider the railway worker who stopped me in a country pub&mdash;not that I spend all my time in country pubs, I might add&mdash;the other week. He is raising seven sons on a railway worker's income. He is going to turn them into fine young Australian men. But he wants an incentive, a reward, for doing the right thing. I am very pleased to see that the new coalition government is going to give incentives for all Australians doing the right thing. You cannot build a nation by snaring men's enterprise and endeavour in a web of bureaucracy and dependency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what of the future? I would like to think that in 100 years time&mdash;that sounds like a very long time away but we will have great&hyphen;great&hyphen;grandchildren then and they will look back and either honour us or decry us for the decisions that we make now&mdash;we would still have a sovereign nation, with one people, one flag, our constitution and our democratically elected government. I would like to think that we still had a nation where people had a spiritual faith, a belief, in something outside themselves, where children were nurtured in a loving home with a mother and father. I would like to think we still had a community of small towns and regional centres&mdash;not a vast megopolis stretching from Melbourne up to Brisbane, what I call `Mel/Syd/Bane', and that we still needed the community of small regional centres, because those are the reservoirs of all the values we hold dear and are distinctly Australian: decency, fellowship, good humour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to see an Australia then that is made up of multinational companies. I would like to think it would still be possible for Australians to have a go, to have a small business or a family farm. I do not want to see future Australians inheriting our financial <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="195"> debts. I would like to think that the children of the future in our great nation had only their own financial debt to bear&mdash;not a generational debt bequeathed by us. I would still like to see a nation that was clean and disease free. I would like to see all Australians&mdash;Aboriginals, my Australian South Sea Islander people, Torres Strait Islanders and others&mdash;sharing on their merits in the opportunities that our great country offers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, in closing I would like to share with you the creed of the Queensland Country Women's Association, one of the largest women's organisations in this country: I would be true for there are those who trust me; I would be pure for there are those who care; I would be strong for there is much to suffer; I would be brave for there is much to dare; I would be friend to all, the foe, the friendless; I would be giving and forget the gift; I would be humble for I know my weakness; I would look up and laugh and love and lift. That is not a bad description of the qualities and the task that lie before a federal member. God bless all my people in Dawson. I pray to be worthy of the great task they have set before me. Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I congratulate you on your election to the honour of the office you hold and in particular as a representative of the Australian Labor Party in this House. I know that you will discharge your office with impartiality and authority as required. I also congratulate those new members who have spoken before me today, particularly the honourable member for Dawson (Mrs De-Anne Kelly) and the honourable member for Namadgi (Ms Ellis), who both gave particularly interesting and thoughtful speeches.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to comment on my background and involvement in my electorate of Barton. It is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not widely known that in 1958, upon the vacation of the seat of Barton by the late Dr Evatt, who was moved into a safer seat, my father contested preselection against the late Len Reynolds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was born in 1958, and so was one of Len Reynolds's sons. In recent years Len's son and I have had the opportunity to discuss our heritage. We both speculated as to whether our creations had any connection with that preselection contest in terms of evening up the public relations aspect. Fortunately I can say that we both concluded neither of our parents would have been influenced in any way by those political events when planning our creation. But my involvement in the political processes of Barton goes back quite some way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As it turned out my father narrowly lost preselection to Len Reynolds, but he went on to become Len's campaign director. They became great mates and supporters of one another in their respective political careers. That is a feature of the Labor Party which I have learnt to respect&mdash;the contest is on but, after the contest, we work together for the cause.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am aware of the contribution that the late Dr Evatt made to this parliament and his contribution as a great jurist and member of the High Court. Barton is of course named after Sir Edmund Barton, our first Prime Minister, who was a High Court judge. It was Sir Edmund Barton who led the delegation to London on the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Bill, which became our constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is of particular significance to me that Dr Evatt held the seat. I commenced my legal career some 16 years ago working as an associate to his nephew, the Hon. Phillip Evatt DSC, a judge of the Federal Court of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moving on to my immediate predecessor and friend, Gary Punch, I do not think it would be said that Gary, at this stage, is a great jurist, but he will have the opportunity to finish off his law degree now that he is retired from this House. In that respect, with Gary's determination we do not know what may come. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="196">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is in that context of the legal background, of the naming of the seat of Barton and of those who have held it that I focus in this maiden speech.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 2 March 1996 a new government was elected. We are particularly lucky in this country that the transition of government occurs so easily, with the minimum of disruption and fuss. It occurs because of people's respect, prizing and cherishing of our democratic principles. Regrettably that is still not a common event when you look at the totality of the globe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There can be no question that the Liberal-National coalition has a mandate to form government in this 38th Parliament, but I will focus on just what is a political mandate. Our democracy would not be valued if it were not based upon fundamental principles of freedom and the rule of law. It is important to remember that democracy has, however, its own capacity for tyranny. The existence of democracy does not indicate liberty among citizens. It is unfortunately the case that some of the most menacing encroachments upon liberty invoke the democratic principle and assert the right to majority rule. In short, our system of government is not based upon the mere exertion of constitutional power obtained from the electorate but adherence to our prized and cherished safeguards against the abuses of arbitrary government action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One learns very quickly when one enters political life that it is necessary to function in a context of great complexity. There are many people who are distrustful of government. Others are divided into groups who are proponents of their particular philosophies or their particular interests. Many indeed will promote their own self&hyphen;interests above the national good. But one way or another they all exert pressure on each and every one of us in this House. It is in that context that any government has to make its decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My belief is that a government which governs simply in the interests of one section of our society is not a democratic government in the sense that we have come to understand that term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question is: how does a government discharge what is an unquestioned mandate <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> but, at the same time, balance policies that will beneficially affect some sectors of society and detrimentally affect other sectors of society? </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The answer is by acknowledging, respecting and adhering to fundamental liberties and the rule of law which we have inherited. Specifically, in words more eloquent than mine, the late Justice Lionel Murphy said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our constitution is affected by the operation of silent constitutional principles which are not mentioned in the constitution . . . they include the principles of responsible government and the separation of the judicial from other powers . . . they include many of the great principles of human rights stated in the English constitutional instruments (the Magna Carta, the Declaration of Rights and the Bill of Rights of 1688) such as those which require observance of due process and disfavour cruel and unusual punishment. They are part of our constitutional heritage (as they are part of the North American heritage) derived from the same English sources . . . these principles emerge from the struggles for freedom against arbitrary government.</PARA>
<PARA>His Honour concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those principles of justice are so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental.</PARA>
<PARA>We have literally inherited that concept of the rule of law&mdash;or, as the Americans speak of, due process of the law&mdash;from generation to generation. In the famous introductory words of the Magna Carta we were given `for ourselves and our heirs forever' the pledges and liberties written in that charter. In chapter 39 of the Magna Carta is found the famous phrase `by the law of land'. Chapter 39 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No free man shall be taken, or imprisoned, or disseised, or outlawed, or exiled, or in any way destroyed; nor shall we go upon him, nor set upon him, but by the lawful judgment of his peers or by the law of the land.</PARA>
<PARA>That chapter has been repeatedly referred to throughout the ages as being the foundation of what we describe as the rule of law. It is a principle which countless thousands of young men and women have literally died for. Those principles are based on a fundamental rule that no government, nor individual, should act against another to their detriment without giving them the right to be heard in their own defence or interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My comments are intended not to be mere platitudes, but to be of very real significance <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="197"> and relevance to government today. The electors of Barton, for instance, have been affected by two significant government actions in the two months that it has been in office. The first is the re-opening of the east&hyphen;west runway at Kingsford Smith airport on 20 March 1996. That decision was made after the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) granted an exemption from the need for an environmental impact statement, which was otherwise required under the provisions of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974. Those administrative procedures involved in the EIS process would have facilitated constituents with the opportunity of presenting argument as to the detriment they are suffering, and will continue to suffer, from the re-opening of the runway, and measures which should have been taken by the government before any such action was taken. That action was taken under the arrogant boast of democratic mandate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It appears that, within 24 hours of receiving a request for the exemption, the Minister for the Environment granted such exemption despite a paragraph in the administrative procedures made under the act which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The minister shall, in determining whether to exempt a Commonwealth action  . . . have regard to the general principle that it is desirable in the national interest that the requirements of those procedures should, as far as reasonably possible, apply to all Commonwealth actions.</PARA>
<PARA>We have heard a lot said today about the control of this parliament on executive action. This was an act of executive action which was taken within 24 hours of consideration. It was taken to put planes over the homes of the people of Barton; to literally intrude on their private property&mdash;because the concept of property goes from the ground upwards&mdash;without giving them the right to be heard, again under the catchcry of `mandate'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further significant issue which has affected my electorate of Barton is a decision of the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation to transport spent nuclear fuel rods through the electorate without any specific notice to electors, without identification of the route and without giving residents an opportunity to have an input in the proposed method of transport, again through <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> proper EIS procedures. We are not talking about trifles or triviality. We are talking about the transport, in some cases metres from doorways where there were sleeping children, of radioactive waste with undisputed carcinogenic properties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the day there may not have been any other means of transporting that waste, or any question as to whether it should have been transported, but the residents of Barton, whose streets were used to transport the substance, had a right to be heard as to how they would be affected by the risks and what steps could have been taken to minimise the risks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are very worrying signs in the executive actions, or the actions of instrumentalities, that have occurred in the first two months of this government which give great concern for the right of people to be heard in their own interests&mdash;specifically the electors of Barton who have been affected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the reverse side of the coin, the concept of the rule of law necessarily means having an agency to identify and enforce that interest. The essentiality of the ability to protect and enforce one's interest was commented upon in the 17th century by Sir Edward Coke, who said that every citizen `has a right for injury done to him by any other subject to take his remedy by the course of the law and have justice and right done to him'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that context it is extremely difficult to comprehend how the government could contemplate removing from the capacity of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission the ability for the commission to resolve a wide variety of subject matter which form, and will inevitably continue to form, the subject of industrial disputes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not talking about political principles of union against employer, we are talking about the right of ordinary workers to obtain redress before an unbiased and impartial umpire in respect of such fundamental matters as, for instance, fair promotional opportunities; fair and safe manning levels; unjustified or unfair victimisation by supervisors; the adequacy of rest breaks; the adequacy of breaks between shifts; superannuation; and, of course, job security.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="198">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are matters which affect not only the immediate worker but the worker's family. To say that you are no longer able to seek redress for any impingement on those rights or any threat to change those rights which have been established is to compel both employers and workers to the law of the jungle and, quite literally, anarchy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While ministers in this House may be in a cloistered environment and their staffers are in a cloistered environment, receiving advice from departmental officers in a cloistered environment, if you talk to any businessmen, to people in the real world, they will say the reason their business has been slow since the election is because of the fear of the outbreak of anarchy. It defies logic as to why any government would even risk such a situation. That risk, which will continue for a long time because of the procedures in bringing this legislation into the House, is highly detrimental to our economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I am very much aware that I am here as a result of the dedication and efforts of a great many people. The efforts of Labor Party branch members in my campaign were second to none. The assistance of my family, who are represented here by my mother, my father and my wife, was very significant indeed. I mention also a member of my staff, Nick Melas, who was of great assistance to me in the campaign. It is an honour to have my father here tonight.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and congratulations to you on your appointment. I appreciate the chance to make this speech at the first opportunity. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be hard pressed, as most members here would be, to name the most widely known Aboriginal name in politics. Although for some time many could not pronounce the word, it became a household talking point earlier this year. The word you are all thinking about is also the name of a suburb of Australia's largest tropical city, Townsville. It is the name of a Queensland state electorate. The word, of course, is now part of my state's history&mdash;Mundingburra. Mundingburra and its new state member, Frank Tanti, will be remembered for a very long time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mundingburra, too, is very special to me. As a Townsville city councillor, I have represented that suburb for the past 11 years and I now represent Mundingburra at the federal level. As you all know, Mundingburra recently changed the government of Queensland. It focused the national spotlight on the capital city of northern Australia. Today, I again direct the national spotlight to Townsville.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="199"> As the light of this national forum reflects on this glass icon, I ask honourable members to reflect on its significance. This is the 1996 award given to Australia's community of the year. This award proudly belongs to Towns ville. This year, Townsville is the brightest star in Australia. From what I am about to outline to you, you will conclude that the city has begun a period of major growth and economic development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the life of this parliament, Townsville will be the fastest growing regional centre in the country. It is very likely we will see a population growth of more than 10 per cent within three years. This is a commercial, Mr Deputy Speaker, with substance. Ministers and members alike need to know and understand that Townsville will be Australia's brightest star for some years to come. Its future is supported by mineral deposits of world significance, by marine science, earth science and tropical medicine research of world significance, and by a government infrastructure such as Australia's largest defence base.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Confidence is on the rise in Townsville and North Queensland. Australia as a whole stands to benefit enormously from the massive injection of capital into the economy of North Queensland that is expected in the near term. The President of the Townsville Chamber of Commerce, Mal Missingham, has provided me with a list of 12 projects committed for completion over the next three years. Together, these 12 projects represent nearly $1 billion worth of investment flowing right now in the Townsville pipeline.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The more business leaders I talk to and the more meetings I attend with the Commonwealth Department of Transport and Regional Development, Townsville Enterprise and the Townsville Chamber of Commerce, the more certain I am that Townsville is at a major development crossroad. Townsville is a city on the move.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Townsville already has a nickel refinery and a copper refinery. A start on a major zinc refinery is only a matter of months away. When completed, the Korea Zinc project will be a $1 billion development in our city&mdash;probably the largest single Korean investment outside of Korea. There is a clear message here for both the government and the people of Townsville. In a sense, Korea Zinc is an acid test for North Queensland. The success of this major development will, in effect, be <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a signal to other companies wanting to invest in North Queensland. A number of major Korean companies are closely watching how Townsville smoothly handles the building of this refinery. Townsville is in the box seat to attract much more substantial Korean development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, Townsville and North Queensland need the joint cooperation of the local, state and federal governments to capitalise on the abundance of industry, business, economic and tourist projects that have already been or could be initiated in the region.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Locally, the Townsville and Thuringowa city councils have the prime responsibility to immediately address the issues of availability of suitably zoned land, the timely provision of water and waste water services and the giving of attention to waste disposal issues. In particular, water and land issues need immediate attention. In addition, I have asked both local authorities to consider establishing a sister city link with Korea. I have advised the mayors that federal funds are available to assist with this. It is an inexpensive `must do' project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The state government, for its part, must urgently approve the construction of a base load power station for the city, and it must also ensure that rail and port infrastructure will meet the needs of the coming development. The federal government can contribute through customs and immigration policies that reduce red tape and through contributions to national infrastructure to serve the region. This government can also take the lead in organising local high&hyphen;level trade missions to Korea. I have already spoken to Australia's ambassador in Korea in this regard. There is, for example, also the potential to export cattle feed from the Burdekin to Korea.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new projects I speak of will provide thousands of jobs&mdash;thousands of jobs&mdash;new road and rail access to the Townsville port, many new secondary industries and value added production generating many more export dollars for our country. But Korea Zinc is not the be-all and end-all for Townsville, nor can we afford to rely on it to be so. We need to look at the spin-off opportunities from downstream mineral processing.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="200">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, sulfuric acid is one of the major by&hyphen;products of zinc processing; it is also one of the primary elements in the production of chemical fertilisers. The development of a chemical fertiliser plant will open up a potential export market worth millions of dollars on a yearly basis. With copper and nickel refineries already established in the region, the capability is there, with the inclusion of a zinc refinery, to expand into the production of alloys and other strategic metals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well, Townsville is on the doorstep of the Bowen Basin gas deposits and the Pentland coal reserves. Development of these resources would result in a petrochemical industry being established. However, research funds are needed to ensure the efficient extraction of gas from the coal reserves. James Cook University in Townsville is ideally placed to undertake this research.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now turn to the need to improve port access. It is clear that a new road-rail access servicing the industrial developments south-east of the city must be provided. The current favoured proposal is to build a new dual link, crossing Ross River near its mouth and extending south-east out of Townsville. This $75 million project provides direct access to the port with minimal impact on existing residential development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, there are several matters our community needs to think about. For example, if the fishing fleet were relocated lower down the river, the need to provide an opening rail and road bridge would be eliminated thereby reducing the costs and river traffic delays. Secondly, a strong case could be made to return all port authority land&mdash;except for a dedicated road-rail corridor&mdash;on the southern bank of the river to an environmental park. Thirdly, I believe that the existing port access for Queensland Nickel and the northern beaches needs to be preserved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Townsville is also looming as a centre for major advancement in airfreight operations, particularly of perishable goods. The Burdekin and Bowen areas of north-east Queensland produce one-fifth of the state's fruit and vegetables; the vast majority is earmarked for domestic markets. Presently, the exported <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> produce from the region is predominantly handled by southern ports in Brisbane and Sydney, despite the proximity of Townsville's all-weather airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a business opportunity for the establishment of cold storage export facilities at Townsville airport. For this to be realised, facilities at Townsville airport would have to be upgraded. An export coordination centre, runway improvements and the airport's handling facilities need to be addressed. Of course, all this takes money, but the benefits extend well beyond airfreight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The RAAF would benefit from these improvements as they would enable the base to comfortably accommodate heavy military transport aircraft, particularly those arriving from the United States. This is a commonsense approach, as RAAF Townsville will have the task of supporting the army's third brigade and the nation's operational Defence Force situated in Townsville.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Improvements would also be a perfect stepping stone to better international airport facilities at Townsville airport. The major jump-off points for international airlines have always been Brisbane and, in recent years, Cairns. The standard of air service, however, between Cairns and Townsville and between Brisbane and Townsville should be seriously re&hyphen;evaluated and money invested in feasibility studies for these necessary upgrades for Townsville airport. In this respect, the tourism industry in the Townsville region would also benefit enormously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moving on to live exports of another kind, Townsville stands to benefit from the great progress made in recent years in the area of live cattle exports. Live cattle exports are the only shining light in an Australian beef industry that continues to suffer from drought and low prices. This growth has been directly linked to growth in the demand for beef in South&hyphen;East Asia&mdash;specifically, Indonesia and the Philippines. As Asia's taste for beef grows&mdash;and it has been growing rapidly&mdash;the demand for packaged, processed and frozen beef will also increase. In areas of Australia where live cattle exports are made from, this has also resulted in growth in frozen and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="201"> packaged beef exports. Townsville can help fill that demand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the new port access in place Townsville residents should have no fear about issues of amenity. Cattle can be railed directly from the Charters Towers district to the port without having to be held in the city. A North Queensland live cattle export enhancement program, initiated by the North Queensland Beef Research Council, is nearing completion. NQBRC have been working closely with the North Queensland Economic Development Board, the Queensland Department of Primary Industries and the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation on that project, the aim of which is to improve grazier and buyer live cattle market education and initiate direct trade delegations to South&hyphen;East Asia. The program will help pave the way for further growth in North Queensland for live cattle exports, and Townsville is perfectly situated to capitalise on this growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I mentioned at the beginning of my address, Townsville is Australia's brightest star. But it is not just because of the big picture and the grand development element. Queenslanders are parochial at the best of times, but the citizens of Townsville and the twin city of Thuringowa take the cake and I am honoured to be able to represent them. Being parochial and proud of who we are and where we come from is central to our identity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Footy fans in this House will know that the North Queensland Cowboys joined the Australian Rugby League last year. Now, the Cowboys did not have the best of years by any stretch of the imagination; perhaps they were playing the wrong code. But that did not stop the fans from turning out in droves week after week to see their team in action&mdash;win, lose, or draw. In their first year in the league they averaged the third highest home ground attendance figure in the 20&hyphen;team competition&mdash;a great effort!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Townsville Suns were the 1993 National Basketball League wooden&hyphen;spooners, but that did not stop the supporters from coming in game after game to pack the home court stadium to the rafters. The Townsville Suns <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are approaching their 42nd sold&hyphen;out home game in a row. This is an NBL record. Thankfully, this season is looking much brighter for the Suns. I wish both the Suns and the Cowboys all the very best.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We take great pride in our achievements and this is by no means restricted to the sporting arena. We are always there for one another as a community. There is no better example of this than the VP50 festival, the major reason why Townsville was named Australia's community of the year this year. Townsville's celebration attracted thousands of veterans, visitors, official guests and media from around the world, and was recognised as the centrepiece of the nationwide Australia Remembers campaign. Indeed, it proved to be the genesis of the campaign. Back then, as a member of the Townsville City Council, it was with enormous pride that I watched as the community&mdash;old and young&mdash;worked hand in hand with business and government and rallied together to make VP50 the enormous success it was.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now, we must once again rally to bring Townsville and North Queensland through to the next century. We must rally the support and cooperation of the community&mdash;of small business, big business and industry, and the local, state and federal governments&mdash;to realise the tremendous economic and investment opportunities that are within our reach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In preparing for my address today I went back through the first speeches of my predecessors who have represented Herbert. One constant theme clearly stood out in those speeches and that was that it was high time that Townsville, Herbert and North Queensland received the recognition and due attention from the federal government that they deserved. In March 1962 the member for Herbert, Ernie Harding, found it necessary&mdash;and I quote from his first speech&mdash;`to ask for a fair deal for Queensland generally and for North Queensland in particular'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since my election as the new member for Herbert I am pleased to be able to say that perhaps I do not have to repeat many of the pleas of my predecessors. Townsville is already receiving close federal attention, and I thank the honourable member for Mackellar <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="202"> (Mrs Bishop), the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) and Senator Grant Tambling for visiting Townsville and delivering on this government's commitment to greater community consultation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Drawing on a theme from Duke Bonnett, the member for Herbert from 1966 to 1977, visits such as these show the people of northern Queensland that the government recognises our handsome contribution to the progress of this country. It is good to see, too, that the Queensland state government is also taking steps in this direction. Queensland Premier, Rob Borbidge recently opened a North Queensland office of the Premier in Townsville.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I have also found out that a member's job does not just stop at the big picture scheme of things. Individuals still have concerns and problems which need to be addressed. To conclude, I would like to relay to the House a brief story.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a Friday morning and the phone rang&mdash;as phones tend to in members' offices&mdash;and it was an elderly lady in quite a deal of distress. Her sister&mdash;a lady in her late eighties&mdash;had fallen ill at home while caring for her bedridden spouse. The couple were fiercely independent people and did not want to be a burden on anyone, so they failed to tell anyone of their situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a week before the sister became aware that they should have help. She tried all the usual agencies but received the stock answer, `If they don't agree to receive help, then there is nothing we can do.' In desperation, the sister finally rang my office. Lyn Richardson took the call and immediately understood that direct action was needed. She got straight on the phone, dialled up the Blue Nurses and said with all the authority in the world, `This is Lyn from the federal member's office. I have two people who are desperately ill and we need to get them into hospital today.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The arrangements with the families and the agency were made. A couple of hours later the couple were in hospital under care. The medical staff who attended them said that had they stayed at home unattended over the weekend they would have probably died.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A federal member's office can open a lot of doors and cut through a lot of red tape. In this situation I am convinced it saved two lives. As much as the federal member's job is to represent the community and to serve the nation as a whole, we simply cannot afford to forget the individuals. None of us can be in our electorate offices all the time, but that does not mean that we still cannot offer that individual service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two people are still alive today who might otherwise not have been and, indeed, it is a joy and a wonderful thing to help others. However, one victory is not enough. Many other battles remain to be fought and the potential rewards for Herbert, North Queensland and Australia are enormous. My message today is: come to Townsville to invest and come to stay, to live and to work. Come and be part of Australia's Community of the Year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before concluding, may I recognise the love I have for my family: my wife, Margaret; my son, Mark; and my daughter, Kylie. Margaret and I are tremendously proud of our family. Mark looks set to become Australia's best young field geologist and Kylie wants to be the first female Prime Minister of this country. I thank my family for their advice and support. Together we work hard for our community and I am pleased and proud that my mum and dad are with us today. Mr Deputy Speaker and members, thank you for your courtesy in listening to my speech. I look forward to working with you all in the life of the current parliament.</PARA></SPEECH>

I am sure you will again bring distinguished service to the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two years ago when I stood in this place to make what was then my first speech to the parliament, I raised the topic of science and technological development. It is very appropriate that that should have been my first speech in this place because I now stand to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="203"> give my first speech in this parliament as shadow minister for science and information technology. It is a theme which I want to continue in my first speech today to the current parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Science has always been critical to the development of Australia. I think anyone who understands the nature of the Australian continent&mdash;we have a very large resource base and a large land mass but a relatively small population by world standards&mdash;will understand the importance of science to this country. Science has always underpinned our place in the world. A very creative and innovative approach to basic science has always underpinned the mining activities in this country as well as agriculture, manufacturing and environmental management. Science is one of our greatest national assets. It helps us to exploit the many other natural assets which this country has and, in doing so, it uses one of our other great natural assets: the people of this country and their skills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How are we going to continue to maintain this very innovative and creative approach which Australians have always brought to science and to the management of it in their country? We have always had a very strong commitment from the public sector. Our public sector science has always been very strong and it has specialised in basic and strategic research which, over the period of the Labor government, increased by some 60 per cent in real terms over that last decade. The CSIRO enjoyed an increase of some 23 per cent in that same period in real terms, and university research has increased by some 164 per cent since 1983. Those are the statistics. They underpin the very strong commitment of the Labor government to science in this country in its various guises and, in particular&mdash;as my remarks later will highlight&mdash;the importance of basic university research and the funding which has been provided to that in recent years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Australia, as I am sure honourable members will appreciate, has shown a greater commitment to university research than even the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, Germany or France. As a percentage of GDP, our expenditure on university research ex ceeds all of those countries with whom we would normally be pleased to compare ourselves. All up, government expenditure on research, development and innovation is some $3.6 billion a year. I think it is very important to include innovation with research and development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Innovation is a much misunderstood topic in this country and it is one which we have failed to exploit in the past. In the last few years, though, science in this country has also been combined with technological innovation in a way which we have not seen before, but in a way which is vital to the future long-term development of this country. If we are to continue to exploit the advantages which we have&mdash;those eminent natural resources on which this country has grown for the last century or more&mdash;then we will need to combine more innovation in our research and development, in our civilian science and in the way in which business applies those techniques to manufacturing, agriculture, mining and all of the other assets that this country has. We will also need to ensure that that massive expenditure of over $3 billion a year is able to reward Australians who are contributing through their tax dollars to that very investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Honourable members who served with me in the last parliament on the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology of this House&mdash;I hope to see it re-established in this parliament because I think it performed a very valuable service in the last and previous parliaments&mdash;will be aware of the value of innovation to this country. Innovation has always been a very important part of our psyche and development, but we have failed in the past to adequately target and identify ways in which government and the private sector can contribute to innovation in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What else has government done in recent years? The cooperative research centres would have to be one of the highlights of the Labor Party's contribution to science in this country over the last decade. They represent a massive commitment by government in a whole variety of scientific and very practical endeavours to ensure that the quality of life in this <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="204"> country is enhanced. Recently, I had the opportunity to attend the launch of the Cooperative Research Centre for Water Quality in Adelaide&mdash;a very significant development in a state which is often quoted as being one of the driest states in the driest continent in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">South Australia has a lot to gain from investment and research on water quality, as Australia generally does, and I know that the CRC which we recently opened in South Australia will return that investment by the public and private sectors many times over. I was certainly struck at the launch of that CRC by the significant number of private sector companies which were prepared to invest their own dollars in that research effort. I am sure that it will certainly repay them, as it will the people of Australia. But how did that process become established? How was that kicked off? Obviously by the very significant leadership and financial commitment of the government sector. Without that investment by the public sector, those private companies would not have had the opportunity to be part of a very exciting research centre.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, can I first place on record my congratulations to you, sir, on your appointment to your high office. Tonight I would like particularly to place on record in this parliament the achievements of some very special individuals in my community and to inform the House of the important recognition they have recently received.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In May of 1988, 12 Sydney businessmen of Italian origin formed the Italian Affair Committee for the purpose of assisting the Spastic Centre of New South Wales in providing services for babies, children and adults with physical disabilities throughout our state. What began as a very successful exercise in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> raising donations for the centre's work in general had by 1993 developed into a joint project with the Spastic Centre aimed at establishing a new branch of the organisation in south&hyphen;western Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Known as the `growthpoint project', the Italian Affair Committee became responsible not only for organising the construction of a new centre for disabled people in the greater western Sydney suburbs but also for its financing. Without knowing it, the committee had embarked on bringing the largest community project ever undertaken in Australia to fruition. Of course, time has shown that they not only did so but did it with style.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, they managed to elicit the donation of a parcel of land from Fairfield City Council for the building of the centre. Next, they coordinated hundreds of local businesses and tradespeople to give their time, expertise and materials for free in the construction of the building. Finally, the committee approached local clubs, businesses and community groups to donate money to assist in the financing of the project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By October last year when the then Prime Minister, the Hon. Paul Keating, officially opened the building, the Italian Affair Committee had not only been successful in getting the centre up and running for the hundreds of disabled people and their families who live in western Sydney but had also managed to raise approximately $3.5 million for the construction of the new regional centre in the process&mdash;this from a total of some $6 million raised by the committee for the New South Wales Spastic Centre over the last seven years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The centre has some 67 rooms specially built and designed to cater for young people with cerebral palsy. The building of the centre became one of the defining moments of my community. Ordinary Australians gave their time and effort to get the new regional centre off the ground. The Italian Affair Committee inspired people not only to give their physical support to the project but also to dig deep into their pockets in order to turn a dream into a reality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would now like to record in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> the names of the 12 members of the Italian Affair <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="205"> Committee in order for the House and the rest of Australia to recognise their contribution. The Italian Affair Committee are: convenor, Roy Mittiga, whose son Joey provided the inspiration; chairman, Pat Sergi; vice&hyphen;chairman, Tony Labbozzetta, and Roy Spagnolo, Charlie Monti, Tony Brescia, Sam Barone, Frank Carioti, Pat Costa, Ferdie Dominelli, Roland Melosi and Nat Romeo.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As someone very closely involved with the committee, I was determined to see that these individuals received some sort of recognition for their selfless and inspiring acts. I subsequently nominated the group for an Advance Australia Foundation award and am now extremely pleased to report that in February this year it was announced that the nomination had been successful and that the Italian Affair Committee would receive a foundation award for community service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That, unfortunately, is where my story begins to turn sour. The Advance Australia Foundation awards were introduced in 1980 to recognise publicly individuals and groups in the community for their outstanding contributions to Australia's people and its way of life. When the committee and I were informed of the honour to be bestowed upon them we were delighted. The award had been offered to these 12 men as a group and so we expected, once the arrangements for the awards ceremony had been made, to receive invitations for all of them. What a shock to find that only one member of the 12 and I received an invitation. I thought that there had to be a mistake.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My office contacted the Advance Australia Foundation immediately and alerted them to the error. Only it was not an error. The foundation had deliberately decided to recognise the achievements of all 12 men by asking only one to the ceremony. Was it because there was no room at Government House? No. Government House informed my office that they were happy to have all 12 and their spouses attend. Did it have something to do with the New South Wales Premier and his recent changes to the role of Government House? No. The Premier's Department had no problem with the 12 attending.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The finger ultimately came to point at the Advance Australia Foundation itself. It was the foundation that would not extend the hand of friendship to all of the 12 and to their wives to share tea and biscuits with the Governor of New South Wales. I even offered to pay for the tea and biscuits. And the reason? According to a letter I received from James Malone, chief executive of the foundation, the decision was taken to `keep the numbers attending the ceremonies to within a manageable limit'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Italian Affair Committee is unique. It organises and works collectively&mdash;not as one chief and his 11 little indians. Decisions and responsibilities are equally shared and so it is entirely appropriate that any recognition of its work should be attended by the entire committee and not just a single officer. The foundation, with its head in the sand, still cannot see this and so I, and I hope the committee, will no longer be attending the ceremony.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a shame that this chapter had to be written. But now, thank goodness, the chapter can finally be closed. The Italian Affair Committee will continue with its fundraising efforts while its legacy, the Spastic Centre at Prairiewood, will continue to thrive. It is the foundation's loss that these wonderful men and their wives will not be at the ceremony. It is a stain on the foundation's name that after giving the award to recognise the actions of 12 men it cannot stand the price of a few extra cups of tea and another packet of biscuits to honour them in the correct fashion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the bad taste that has been left in all of our mouths by this episode, I am still very glad that I nominated the Italian Affair Committee for its award and I am very pleased to know that it won. I am sure that members of this House would support me in congratulating the Italian Affair Committee on its fine work.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I raise tonight the question of homeless youth, an issue which I have raised in this parliament before some years ago and an issue which I brought before the Keating government on many occasions. I received very little satisfaction from the Keating government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I attended a meeting convened by a Bendigo family who invited a number of other parents from surrounding districts. They brought it to my attention that a number of young people were being encouraged to leave home. The distress that it caused to their families was immense and tragic. I raised this issue with the Keating government at the time and got very little response. That is why today's announcement by the new Prime Minister, the Hon. John Howard, that he would set up a prime ministerial youth homeless task force brought great appreciation from me. I am sure it will be appreciated by the parents who convened that meeting some years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It creates great trauma when young people leave home and cut themselves off from their families and family life. What better way to start off this prime ministerial task force than to appoint Captain David Eldridge from the Salvation Army as chairman of the committee?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a very close involvement with the Salvation Army. On Friday in Bendigo I will be launching the Salvation Army's Red Shield Appeal. I know of the very fine work they do&mdash;as is done by many other community welfare organisations such as the Brotherhood of St Laurence, St Vincent de Paul, St Luke's Family Care in Bendigo and a whole range of community welfare organisations&mdash;in catering and helping to service people who have some disability, who are in discomfort or who are simply having a very tough time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Salvation Army is doing a magnificent job in the Bendigo area. I look forward to the work of Captain David Eldridge on the youth homeless task force. I know that the parents of the young people in Bendigo who came to see me and convened that meeting will be <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> appreciative of the efforts of the Prime Minister in convening this task force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the support services already offered by the Salvation Army in Bendigo include: emergency services; alcohol and drug rehabilitation; emergency housing; family support; material aid provision; employment, training and placement programs; counselling; court work; and aid through their thrift industries. An education program to teach people how to reduce their weekly food bill by shopping cheaply and nutritionally continues to play an important role in the Bendigo community and surrounding areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure that the Salvation Army and all of the welfare agencies involved in the task force, which will be overseen by the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan), will do an excellent job. It is a very important task that they have been asked to undertake by the Prime Minister. I feel sure that we will come up with some answers. One of the issues that they will need to address is young people being encouraged by some organisations to leave home. They will look at all those departments that have been encouraging young people to leave their homes and the protectiveness of their families.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Through representations to me today from the Corio electorate and from press reports, it has been brought to my attention that on Monday at a Christies auction a culturally priceless work of Australian art went under the hammer to a foreign buyer for $1.9 million. That piece of art was Eugene Von Guerard's work <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">View of Geelong</EMPHASIS> , which was painted in 1856. The painting is one of the artist's earliest works and is very significant to Geelong's history. It depicts the area five years after the discovery of gold in Victoria. At that time Geelong was experiencing a surge in its economy, stimulated by the influx of people heading to Ballarat in search of gold and also by the export of wool from its productive western district hinterland through the port of Geelong. </PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="207"> Von Guerard is well known for his panoramic scenes and the fine detail of his paint ings. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">View of Geelong</EMPHASIS> is no exception. The painting depicts the development of Geelong looking down from Ceres and is in microscopic detail. He has depicted the beginnings of the Geelong West township, sailing and steam ships moored at Point Henry, Yarra Street and the Botanical Gardens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Geelong art gallery in its centenary year worked hard with the assistance of the Visard Foundation and the Victorian state government to put together over $1 million to mount a substantial bid for the painting. On the basis of previous art sales for similar works, it would have been more than enough to win the bid. Alas, that was not so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are several issues raised by the sale of this work to foreign buyers. Significant and important movable cultural heritage pieces such as this are protected under the Protection of Movable Cultural Heritage Act 1986. The National Cultural Heritage Committee assesses applications to export such pieces. In this case it has granted an export licence and I and others would like to know why.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee recently successfully recommended the retention in Australia of the painting <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">View of the town of Sydney</EMPHASIS> on the basis that it was associated with a significant place or person in Australia. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal upheld the export ban on the basis that the loss of this painting would significantly diminish the cultural heritage of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I appeal on the floor of this House to the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) to directly intervene in this matter, overturn the decision and refuse the export permit. I read with interest that Dr Joseph Brown, an original member of that committee, has expressed a similar view. He has described the sale of this particular piece of work to foreign buyers as treasonable.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate you, Mr Speaker, on your appointment. It is always a pleasure to come into this chamber as part of a strong, vital and youthful government and, as part of such, I will enjoy addressing you for the next three years. As my fellow members are quite aware, my electorate spans Perth's northern suburbs and is home to more than 100,000 people, all very dedicated to their local member. Although I do not presume to be in the same league as my electorate's namesake, Mrs Edith Dircksey Cowan, I do share many of her philosophies and her personal sense of motivation. Ms Edith Cowan is possibly best known to each of you, indeed to most Australians, as the face on the new $50 note, one of which I have just borrowed from my colleague.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new $50 note shows an open, honest and sensitive face accompanied by some smaller illustrations. However, this recognition is really only the postscript to a most remarkable story&mdash;a story which commenced on 2 August 1861 in Geraldton, Western Australia, with the birth of baby Edith; an event which was to have a profound effect on the shaping of thought, policy and legislation in Western Australia, if not Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1897, nearly 100 years ago, Edith married James Cowan, the brother of one of her early teachers. It was during her husband James's appointment as police magistrate that Mrs Cowan became interested in social questions, the franchise for women, day nurseries and the boarding&hyphen;out system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1915, she was appointed as member of the bench of the newly appointed Children's Court&mdash;on which she was to sit for a further 18 years. In 1920, she became a justice of the peace and subsequently was given an OBE. By 12 March 1921, following the Western Australian state election, she had the honour of becoming the first woman member of any parliament in Australia.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="208">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Considered a forceful speaker, Mrs Cowan was responsible for, and succeeded in, amending the Administration Act so that mothers were placed on equal footing with fathers when their children died intestate, and introducing the Women's Legal Status Act which aimed at abolishing the restrictions of entry of women to civil office, occupation and to practise law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After leaving parliament, Mrs Cowan channelled a great deal of her energies into the National Council of Women, became a freemason, had delegate status to the Sixth International Conference of Women in Washington, and was the first woman appointed to the Provincial Synod of Western Australia. Mrs Cowan was also a member of the Perth Hospital Board, and one of the founders of the Western Australian Historical Society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Undeniably, Mrs Cowan was an amazing Australian, an amazing woman and an amazing humanitarian. I very much admire her dogged and spirited approach to the real issues, and I respect and support her overriding commitment to eliminating injustice in our community. It is somewhat ironic that these underlying values&mdash;in all her work&mdash;were established not in the materialistic 1980s, or even in the preceding few decades before this, but in the early 1920s!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, I bring this to your attention not as a history lesson for my fellow members but to alert you first and foremost to the considerable efforts and talent of Australia's first woman parliamentarians and also to alert you to the fact that this year marks 75 years since Mrs Cowan was first elected to parliament. This is a benchmark of considerable significance and one which should be noted by this House on behalf of all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, I believe that Mrs Cowan could rightly be considered as a catalyst to the reform process which today affords this House and state parliaments of Australia. Mrs Cowan recognised the fact that gender should not be a prerequisite for assuming ability, potential or wealth. This effort and thought has been translated into real terms in that today we have 46 women, in all, represented in this parliament. Simply put, this represents <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 20.5 per cent of this parliament. This figure, although less than I would personally prefer, recognises the fact that these women have entered parliament not through some arbitrary figure, fact or formula, but through hard work, solid personal performance, a commitment to excellence and a strong skill base.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This year we celebrate the largest contingency of women parliamentarians ever to enter any Australian parliament. This year we celebrate 75 years of women's participation in public office. This year we celebrate the 75th anniversary of Edith Cowan being the first woman to enter parliament in Australia.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to join in some of the comments made by the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) about the tremendous work of the Salvation Army because, as he quite correctly remarked, very shortly there will be the Red Shield appeal which is their major annual fundraising exercise. As the City Chairman for Wanneroo, closely involved with the Red Shield appeal in my region, I take a great deal of pleasure in acknowledging some of the key people in the Wanneroo City appeal team. Of course, I look forward to a successful outcome in my second term as the City Chairman for Wanneroo.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First of all, I acknowledge Captain Neil Venables from the Heathridge Citadel of the Salvation Army. Neil and his family are tremendous community people. The Heathridge Citadel serves a very large area that has a large number of families in which there are, in some instances, financial hardships and social problems. They do an extraordinarily good job of making sure that they play their part in assisting to alleviate the sorts of common social problems that go hand in hand with these types of things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might add that during the last financial year they suffered some quite significant problems in their government funding. That is something that occurred as a result of the fudging of the unemployment figures, because the funding was based on the unemployment for the region. Of course, as the previous <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="209"> government tried to conceal the unemployed through various schemes, then they in fact artificially lowered the threshold for the Salvation Army's funding. That meant in Heathridge they had a shortfall.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Which is a shame, as the member for Fairfax quite correctly points out. I would also point out that Lieutenant Paul Hately is at the Merriwa Citadel in Merriwa looking after the needs of a very fast growing community. My electorate is one of the fastest growing regions in the country, and in Merriwa, Clarkson and Butler, the brand new suburb developments in my electorate extraordinarily large numbers of new families with children, many of whom are in lower income brackets, are coming into the electorate, coming into these areas needing that sort of help.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to thank, if I may, Bob Hales, who is a soldier with the Salvation Army and who helps me out on a voluntary basis in my office but who is also very heavily involved with the appeal. I also acknowledge the Mayor of the City of Wanneroo, Councillor Arnold Dammers, who has also taken on a key role in helping out with our fundraising activities for 1996 in the Red Shield appeal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, Mr Speaker, I would like to support the comments made earlier today by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) in relation to gun control. As somebody said in the last few days, one can make knee&hyphen;jerk reactions. But as a former policeman in Western Australia, someone who had a job in the supervision and regulation of firearms licensing and the like, I am conscious of the fact that although in Western Australia we had a very tight and quite strict firearms licence regime, we found it very difficult from time to time when we came across people who had come from other states&mdash;in particular, Queensland, where it appears that firearms are much easier to obtain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I give the example of when I was a uniformed constable at Subiaco. A young fellow of about 22 or 23 arrived in the station. He was doing the right thing, he was being a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> good citizen. He had actually driven across from Queensland in his ute with a semi&hyphen;automatic firearm hanging up in the back of the ute all the way from wherever he had come from in Queensland. He brought the gun in to get it licensed. Of course, we immediately seized it and pointed out to him that, in fact, he had committed an offence ever since he had arrived in Western Australia. Obviously having done the right thing and brought the firearm in, we were conscious that he had done his citizenship bit or duty to try to get himself licensed in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this particular case, when we asked him why he wanted to have this firearm in the future, he said he was travelling in Western Australia and he needed it just in case he got into trouble. We were not quite sure exactly what sort of trouble he was likely to get into. But, quite clearly, as the Prime Minister has indicated, with a council of police ministers coming up shortly there is a need for not only uniform national gun laws but also a national register of firearms&mdash;that is quite clearly now a very important element&mdash;and a comprehensive ban on semi&hyphen;automatic firearms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot, for the life of me, see any reason for anyone in Australia, other than a member of the armed services or the police or someone in some other emergency capacity, to own and possess a semi&hyphen;automatic firearm. It is, quite clearly, time for all semi&hyphen;automatic firearms to be banned and probably time for an amnesty to allow those people who still have them to hand them in without fear of being prosecuted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by saying that I subscribe to the bipartisan views of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. Quite clearly, the national government now has a fundamental role in ensuring there are uniform national firearm laws.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

On occasions you will feel as though you are walking through a minefield but I am quite <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="210"> sure that you, with all your service experience, will handle the job well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the address&hyphen;in&hyphen;reply debate, one of the most important segments of my speech was to be economic factors; but, unfortunately, I did not get to it. When we think about the economic sectors of the Northern Territory we have to think about the mining sector, the tourism sector, Asian trade, the gas pipeline, defence, primary industry and the horticulture industry.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5M6">Mr DONDAS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And motherhood, yes. We will get to statehood at some other stage. The important thing is that the Northern Territory cannot be quarantined from the Commonwealth cuts that are likely to happen. It would be unrealistic to think that we could be. I believe, in light of the deficit which the coalition has inherited from the previous government, we have to be very cautious in terms of what the expectations will be for the Northern Territory. I remind honourable members of the arguments for the Northern Territory to be considered for special funding needs, especially in areas of health, education, housing and roads in smaller remote communities. Land rights and native title have an impact on development, as does the duplication of services by the Commonwealth in the provision of state&hyphen;like functions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The economic factors cover many sectors&mdash;uranium, gold, bauxite, manganese, copper, natural gas, zinc, Timor Gap oil and other products, which represented $1.49 billion worth of exports from the Northern Territory in 1994&hyphen;95. With tourism, in the early 1970s our figures were 50,000 tourists a year. In 1994&hyphen;95 over one million tourists visited the Northern Territory. Present investment in tourism ventures and infrastructure is over $200 million and the estimate of revenue from tourism in the Northern Territory is $645 million for 1994&hyphen;95.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The territory has been at the forefront in developing trade links with Asia over many years. If you draw a radius of 3,000 kilometres north from the city of Darwin you pick up a population base of about 300 million. Come south for 3,000 kilometres and the best you can pick up is a population base of 18 <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> million. Four years ago Asian trade was worth $28 million a year to the Northern Territory; in 1994&hyphen;95 it was some $123 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Concerning primary industry and live cattle exports, the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay), in his maiden speech, spoke about the live exports that were evolving from the Townsville region. When the Northern Territory started its live cattle export program some 10 years ago, southern producers thought that they were not on the right boat, but in 1996 we can assume that about 300,000 head of cattle will be exported through the port of Darwin and the indications for 1996&hyphen;97 are that, hopefully, as many as half a million head of cattle could be exported through the Darwin port.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Horticulture and aquaculture industries are expanding all the time. I understand that in the pearling industry, which is one of the major fishing industries that we have, exports are totalling in excess of $100 million a year. Defence spending was about $54 million per annum in the territory last year. Obviously, defence has become a very important part of the economic factors in the Northern Territory and all indications are that the coalition is going to maintain the current defence infrastructure and spending in its budget. As I said earlier in the address&hyphen;in&hyphen;reply debate, one per cent of the population of Australia produces exports to two per cent of the GDP.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

She worked for the British Labour Party during the period of Attlee's leadership and continued to be a great servant of the Labor Party and the Labor movement until this year when she died.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will have another opportunity publicly to speak of her contribution in many other forums of public life&mdash;of her profound knowledge of issues of social security and her commitment to many worthwhile causes. But, time having virtually run out in this adjournment debate, what I want to do today on behalf of my two colleagues and, I think, every member of the Australian Labor Party is to note our profound regret at the passing of this great Australian and to express to her children&mdash;Jonathan, Michael, Timothy, Sarah and Rupert, some of whom I am privileged to call my very close personal friends&mdash;our great sympathy in their loss.
