<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Procedure, I present the committee's report, incorporating a dissenting report, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report on the conduct of divisions</EMPHASIS> , together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HE4">Mr ANDREW</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Procedure Committee report deals with the mechanisms the House uses to record members' votes on the questions put before it&mdash;an issue about which many members have quite strong opinions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I intend to speak for only four of the 10 minutes allotted by the Selection Committee for discussion of this report today, although the issues it covers really need more time than that. I will be brief because the chairman, the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan), wishes to extend to the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) the courtesy of the opportunity to speak on behalf of the minority report signatories focusing on the question of electronic voting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, one of the report's unanimous recommendations has implications for the House's Independent members in particular. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Therefore, the chairman believed that at least one of them should also have the opportunity to comment today. The committee supports that course of action. The honourable member for Cunningham has indicated that he, too, will limit his speaking time to four minutes for this latter reason.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both the average number of divisions per day and the time required to conduct and tally each division have been much greater this year than at any time since 1975, the average for 1996 being approximately 40 minutes per day in divisions. The committee's recommendations aim to streamline division procedures, but without diminishing any member's right to both call for a vote and place his or her vote on the public record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a matter for regret that the issue of electronic voting has resulted in a minority report. I emphasise that the majority view is not one of rejection of electronic voting. However, the reality is that present budgetary constraints make it unlikely that funding for its installation&mdash;estimated in 1993 as $2 million over three years&mdash;would be available. In any event, selection and commissioning of an electronic voting system would take considerable time, which would not assist the House and those of its members who believe that quick action should be taken now to reform the present somewhat cumbersome procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee has recommended two main changes to our division procedures. Both proposals already operate effectively in other Australian parliaments. Their implementation by sessional order would allow the House to trial them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the first proposal, members' votes would be recorded while division bells are still ringing, the tellers having been appointed immediately a division is called. The tellers for the ayes and the noes would stand on opposite sides of the Members' Hall entrance to the chamber. After registering their vote with the appropriate tellers, members would sit on the side of the House which corresponds to their vote. Most members' votes could be recorded before the doors are locked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee has also recommended that the bells be rung for five minutes instead of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> four as at present. Under the above procedure, that is unlikely to add to the total division time. For consecutive divisions&mdash;that is, those for which the bells are rung for one minute&mdash;only those members who either did not vote in the immediately preceding division or wish to vote differently in the new division would need to report to the tellers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our second proposal expands the provisions for recording dissent by allowing a division to be cancelled after the bells have been rung if there are eight or fewer members in the minority. The number and names of members in the minority would be automatically recorded but not the details of the members in the majority. The right of any two members to call a division and to have their vote on the public record would not be diminished. However, this procedure would save at least some of the excessive time presently required to conduct the count in those divisions in which nearly all members wish to vote on one side.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Procedure Committee is confident that these recommendations, if adopted, will improve the efficiency of the division process. I hope that before the House adjourns for the summer recess more time will be available for members to properly debate this report, which I present on behalf of the chairman, Mrs Sullivan.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) and my good friend the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) for the opportunity to make some comments today on the dissenting report of the Standing Committee on Procedure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I simply draw the attention of members to the report of a parliamentary delegation which I led in October and November 1993 to a number of countries to examine the issue of electronic voting. I took with me one of the great sceptics of this process, the Clerk of the House of Representatives. By the time we came back, he too was convinced that electronic voting was the way to go. I remind members that if they can do it in the US Congress, the European parliament, the parliaments of Scandinavia, Russia, Lebanon, Yemen, the Czech Republic, Nicaragua, the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6918"> United Nations and many other states and territories around the world, why can we not do it here? The wiring is in place. It was always part of the design process that electronic voting should be part of the operation of the House of Representatives and I believe the time is right to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much has been made of the cost associated with this proposal. Let me make some suggestions, particularly to you Mr Speaker, about cost. As you know, I brought down a private member's bill earlier this year which reflected views I, when Speaker in the last parliament, had formed as to how this parliamentary precinct should be run. I am prepared to accept modifications to my proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, you will recall that I said we should reduce the number of departments on the hill from five to three. I believe some modifications are being discussed which give the chamber departments particularly a much greater say. I think that is now worth looking at very seriously. Again I appeal to you, Mr Speaker, and to Madam President, to perhaps have another close look at this proposal and to take it up with the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the five departments running this parliamentary precinct can be reduced to perhaps two, 2&half; or three, then surely we can save some money for the government. On this side of the parliament we would be quite happy to look at that. The money thus saved could go towards the installation of electronic voting. I remind all honourable members that, by not having to come in here to answer division bells, perhaps for a division that takes on average 11 minutes, we can get on with the more important tasks that we as members of parliament are required to perform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I again refer all members to the report I brought down in this place in 1993. I refer members to the dissenting report contained in the Procedure Committee report which has been tabled today for consideration. There is no doubt I have a great deal of respect for the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) who put forward a very reasonable proposition for the consideration of the Procedure Committee as to how we might deal with this on a temporary basis. Perhaps <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that is right, and perhaps we could give it a trial.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I see no reason why funding cannot be found by looking again at the way in which the parliamentary departments in this place are run so that electronic voting can be installed. With all the smart card technology that is around today, people do not necessarily have to sit in their seats to record their votes&mdash;although they must be in the parliament. So I think there is a real way in which this could be utilised to the greater benefit of all members in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by saying that the reason it is so important that we effect modifications to our voting patterns in this place is so that we can be freed up for the more important issues we have to deal with. That is a very real reason why the dissenting report is worth consideration. We have not dissented from the main report simply because we are trying to be narks or to simply be an opposition; we did so because, on the basis of previous evidence and due to the fact that modern technology means the cost associated with the installation of electronic voting would be a lot less than the $2 million or $3 million talked about before, we think electronic voting is worthy of consideration and should be brought to the attention of the government, and particularly to you, Mr Speaker, and Madam President.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly to the report of the Standing Committee on Procedure. As the person who put up the submission which has basically been recommended by the Procedure Committee, I will say one or two things. My proposal was perceived as the short&hyphen;term solution to the problem we all recognise in that excessive time is presently taken to conduct divisions. In my view, divisions must be conducted in the chamber and during the period a bill is being dealt with. I do not support the concept of five or six divisions taking place in a given period; I think it takes part of the atmosphere away from it. It is bad enough now when one finds oneself here saying, `What am I voting on?' That situation could get worse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that this proposal should not be perceived as the alternative to electronic <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6919"> voting. I think electronic voting should stay on the agenda. Mr Speaker, you will have to struggle with the budget that will fund it, but I gather from the previous speaker, the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), that there may be means within the budget to achieve that over time. But please do not take our remaining newspaper from us to do it. The reality is that no doubt over time we could address the more serious issue of&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present the committee's report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Two international agreements on tuna&mdash;3rd report</EMPHASIS> , together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0K6">Mr BARTLETT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today's tabling is the culmination of several months of public hearings and inspections in Canberra, Hobart, Perth, Adelaide and Port Lincoln. It has been a complicated task in respect of what appears on the surface to be a fairly simple bilateral fishery agreement with Japan.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1979 a `Bilateral Agreement on Fisheries between the Government of Australia and the Government of Japan, Head Agreement' was signed to facilitate close cooperation in the conservation and optimum utilisation of the living resources within Australia's exclusive economic zone, EEZ. Under this agreement, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> annual subsidiary agreements permit Japanese long&hyphen;line vessels to catch about 7,000 tonnes of fish within the EEZ. The Japanese vessels target a number of tuna species including yellowfin, bigeye and southern bluefin tuna.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Concerns over the depletion in the southern bluefin tuna, SBT, stock resulted in the establishment of the Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna. Australia, New Zealand and Japan are parties to this convention which ensures, through appropriate management, the conservation and optimum utilisation of SBT. The Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna meets annually to determine the global total allowable catch and national quota allocations for the SBT fishery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The delays in setting recent quotas resulted from differences in opinion as to whether SBT stocks are recovering after a period of significant decline. Australia and New Zealand have opposed increasing the quotas, preferring the precautionary approach to managing stocks as required by the United Nations Agreement on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks. Japan has excess capacity in its fishing fleet which could be utilised to catch additional SBT quotas. However, the committee supports the continuation of the cautious approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year the commission determined that the total allowable global catch of SBT was 11,750 tonnes. Since the introduction of national quotas Australia, New Zealand and Japan have been required to reduce their annual catch. However, when the Japanese quota was decreased, the catches of other nations then increased through reflagging or by way of Japanese&hyphen;Korean company interactions. It was estimated that the catch by Korea, Indonesia and Taiwan, which are not party to the convention, was of the order of 3,200 tonnes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee believes that the capacity to manage tuna stocks could be enhanced by the introduction of a certificate system which requires that all fish entering the market be identified to prevent fish caught by non&hyphen;parties to the commission being accepted in the market. While there may be significant difficulties in introducing a certificate system, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6920"> such a system could significantly improve the management capacity for the conservation of migratory species such as tunas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The subsidiary agreements provide Japanese fishing vessels with access to Australian ports as well as fishing rights within the AFZ. This is linked to the commission in that it is Australia's policy that the subsidiary agreements cannot be finalised until the SBT quotas are set.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee recommends the separation of port access and the subsidiary agreements as this arrangement is not commercially satisfactory. Although the committee appreciates that an open port access policy is unacceptable, it believes that the Commonwealth government should investigate other mechanisms for linking port access with Australia's fisheries resource management objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee suggests linking this with Japan's participation in the Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna&mdash;CCSBT. Under this arrangement, other countries cannot have access to Australian ports to facilitate their fishing activities. While this could be used to encourage countries such as Korea and Indonesia to join the convention, the wider implications will need to be addressed by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is imperative that Australia does not assist the capacity of other nations to fish in a manner which is detrimental to the long&hyphen;term sustainability of some species. Japan has already cooperated in implementing a number of environmental measures requested by the Australian government and it would not be in the Australian fishing industry's long&hyphen; term interest to assist countries that have not given the same undertakings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are substantial mutual benefits to Australia and Japan in the subsidiary agreements. The subsidiary agreements provide the framework within which difficult decisions in relation to fisheries can be contained and managed without impacting adversely on the broader bilateral relationship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The considerable cooperation between Australian and Japanese fishermen has assisted both countries. Australian fishermen have learnt from Japanese long&hyphen;liners, and also <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> derive considerable benefit from the presence of Japanese vessels because of the data provided on location and catch. Cooperation has extended to joint ventures, assistance in the establishment of the tuna farm experiment, joint financing of external scientists, joint efforts in addressing the seabird bycatch problem, and reducing the catch of small tuna. However, the committee is not convinced that the subsidiary agreements need to be renewed on an annual basis. There are a number of benefits outlined in this report that would support a biennial or even a five&hyphen;year agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To prevent the urgency provisions for tabling treaties from being invoked each year, the committee recommends that the agreements run for at least two years. The committee also believes that the current process may need to be revised to ensure that the delays experienced in signing last year's agreement do not become an annual event.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Strong evidence to the inquiry supported the concept of the subsidiary agreement, with a number of submissions and witnesses requesting amendments or a gradual phasing out of Japanese access with progressive Australianisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of witnesses requested additional fishing exclusion zones to facilitate local industry development. The committee supports this principle and believes that these changes should be implemented where Australian fishermen can demonstrate they have the capacity to utilise the resources in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, the committee now supports the extension of the exclusion zone around Tasmania to 50 nautical miles. While the committee accepts that the Tasmanian fishing fleet may not yet have the capacity to fully utilise the tuna stocks in that region, the Australian fishing fleet does have that capacity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6921"> The committee is also concerned that a number of prime pelagic species are not included in subsidiary agreements. In some cases there is inadequate knowledge on the sustainability of tuna, billfish and swordfish species. The committee commends the re search already in progress and supports a cautious approach in managing these stocks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to environmental measures, the committee heard a number of concerns in relation to the bycatch of sharks, marlin and swordfish in SBT long&hyphen;line operations. There is also a number of issues in relation to the administrative and legislative aspects of implementing conservation measures that need to be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of particular concern was the bycatch of seabirds, about which the committee has made a number of recommendations. The honourable member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) will deal with this in more detail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee received a number of submissions from the recreational and game fishing sector requesting the release of all marlin bycatch by long&hyphen;line vessels&mdash;a request which the committee supports. Further work is needed into the relative economic values of these two sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee was provided with a number of conflicting views on the benefits and disadvantages of the bilateral arrangements. The committee believes that a full cost&hyphen;benefit analysis should be undertaken to determine the true benefit of these agreements to both countries. SBT is a global fishery and requires continued cooperation to enhance its commercial benefits in a sustainable way and to protect endangered species.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second agreement to be considered in this report is the agreement for the establishment of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission, the IOTC. The formation of this commission continues the trend to form international management regimes for highly migratory tuna species in light of their vulnerability to fishing on the high seas. The IOTC will act as a regional fisheries management organisation for major international tuna fisheries for yellowfin, skipjack, bigeye, albacore and SBT. Membership is available to Indian Ocean rim countries and countries that fish in the Indian Ocean.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While Australia will request that the IOTC recognise the competence of the CCSBT, there will be continuing pressure for the IOTC to play a role in the management of activities <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which will impact on SBT and other tuna stocks. Further, countries which do not currently belong to the CCSBT but have significant SBT catches may become members of the IOTC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee believes that Australia should become a party to the IOTC and that an instrument of acceptance be deposited on or before 2 December 1996. The committee also notes Western Australia's particular interest in the activities of the IOTC. It believes there is the capacity to have greater participation by the states and territories in the treaty process where the issues involved will significantly impact on the economy of those states. The committee therefore recommends that representatives from Western Australia be given the opportunity to participate in the delegation to, and consultations relevant to, the activities of the IOTC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On behalf of the committee chairman, the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor), I thank my colleagues on both sides of this place for their contribution, cooperation and counsel. I also acknowledge the great contribution of the secretariat and, in particular, Cheryl Scarlett. I commend the report to the House.</PARA>

<TIME.STAMP>(12.53 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been most interested in the discussions and the public consultations that have taken place concerning these two international treaties on tuna fishing. As the report says, the increasing complexity in global interactions may have implications far wider than the capacity of any single state to resolve. It is through the use of the treaty&hyphen;making process that these interactions can be managed. Thus, the Treaties Committee's task is to develop arguments for bilateral negotiations between nations on issues that are of mutual interest and to make recommendations. In the process, I have learnt much about the Australian fishing industry. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6922"> We were told, for instance, that the capacity of the Australian fishing industry has exceeded the abundance of local fish resources in some areas and that the industry has become increasingly dependent on migratory species which are found further offshore.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are beginning to come into conflict with the Japanese whose fishing vessels have for some time used the fish resources not usually exploited by the Australian fleet. But the resource has been dwindling and there needs to be a review to look at issues such as the sustainability of the stock and the importance of port access to port communities and the possibility of catching other species, and the bycatch of fish and birds. However, some fishermen believe that only a few boats are working the tuna and there is not the capacity to push the Japanese further out. Others have difficulties with getting quota or need funds to buy a quota. Then there are the difficulties with the gear conflict and the fact that there was little communication between the two countries' boats because of the language problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The discussion resulted in recommendations that the exclusive zone be extended and that this would be further reviewed. It was also decided there should be discussions about the communications problem. The Tasmanian government believes that a 50 nautical mile extension would be beneficial to the local fishing industry as long as it does not have an impact on the number of Japanese fishing boats visiting the port. The proximity of fish to the Tasmanian coast depends on the presence of bait inshore and other climatic conditions. There are a number of conflicting views on the benefits and disadvantages of the bilateral agreements. It was thought that a full cost benefit analysis could be undertaken to determine the true benefit of these agreements to both countries. A number of issues may be resolved if this information is available. A gradual approach may be necessary until a cost benefit analysis is done on the impact of the bilateral agreement on the local commercial and recreational fishing industries. Our fishing industry is very important to us and this inquiry only highlighted the many problems of an industry that is reliant on the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> migratory habits of its resource coupled with what happens when other nations wish to share this resource.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fish do not know boundaries and planning to ensure there is a fair share for all is beset with difficulties. However, the committee believed it addressed some of the pressing points and I look forward to hearing the outcomes and recommendations from the government on our report. The difficulties of having a bycatch of birds, including the large albatross, is a great problem and the committee spent some time on the issue and took very good evidence in that regard. The accreditation system for fish which we have touched on in the report is one way that we should try to go in talks with other nations. An accreditation system, structured throughout the world, would start to eliminate those in the fishing industry who would be taking fish and bycatches that are unsustainable in the long term. I recommend the report to all members and look forward to the government's reply to the work undertaken for this report.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The albatross is not just a seabird. It is a colossus. It can live for 60 years and perhaps for longer. The wandering albatross can have a wingspan of more than 11 feet. It mates for life. It is warm, friendly, and a great comfort to seafarers. My first trip at sea as a fourth engineer officer on the MV <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kaituna</EMPHASIS>  presented me with that marvellous sight of the giant birds following the vessel&mdash;gliding, tipping the crests of the waves and never appearing to flap their enormous wings. These animals are the conscience of the sea; the sailors' friend. Their spirit is immortalised in Coleridge's famous work, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The</EMPHASIS>  <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rime of the Ancient Mariner</EMPHASIS> . And what happened when the miscreant sailor shot the albatross? Misery, starvation then death. We have not learnt from this. Most of the wandering albatross killed by long&hyphen;line fishing vessels are young birds. The estimate of bykill of wanderers is about the same as the number of chicks reaching fledgling stage. This means there is no recruitment. Wanderers do not breed until they are 11 years old and they need to live to 30 years on average to replace themselves in their breeding population.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6923">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My concern is that there appears to be a philosophy of minimisation, rather than an elimination of seabird bycatch. The committee has recommended that the commonwealth government expedites research into eliminating seabird bycatch as a matter of priority. These words were very carefully chosen. Long&hyphen;line fishing intensified in the early 1960s but the effects on albatross were not detected until the mid&hyphen;1980s. Eleven years later little progress has been made. The incidental catch of seabirds by long&hyphen;line vessels was declared a key, threatening, process on 24 July 1995 under the Endangered Species Protection Act and 14 species of seabirds are potentially considered at risk. It is the only activity added to the ESP Act since it was enacted and it is the first key and threatening process to be listed that relates to the marine areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To my horror, evidence given to the committee indicated that, globally, 44,000 albatrosses were killed annually through long&hyphen;line fishing, more than 7,000 in Australian waters. This carnage must be stopped. Ongoing studies funded by the Commonwealth government have recorded only 16 to 20 pairs of wanderers breeding at Macquarie Island over the last two years. Under the ESPA another three albatross species have been nominated for listing. Changes in long&hyphen;line procedures, quotas or methods should always be evaluated for effect on effort. More hooks set translate to more bykills. So until mitigation measures are available that eliminate bycatch of seabirds the quota increases should not be granted. They should not be granted unless there is a demonstrated decrease in effort.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Evidence to the committee indicates that none of the existing technologies can prevent seabird bykill and that a number of techniques may need to be applied simultaneously to reduce the level of bycatch. Australia is actively working on seabird bycatch through the Commission on the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna but this relies on Japan's agreement. Fishermen are also given publications such as Japanese cartoons `Catch Fish not Birds' and the Tasmanian National Parks and Wildlife Service has been active in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> changing the overall culture towards seabird catches.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The CCSBT has established an ecologically related species working group to enable consultation on technical details of bird mitigation measures in the high seas environment. Such consultation provides the opportunity to change behaviour on the high seas by consensus as it is appreciated that the EEZ is only a small part of the territory which is inhabited by the albatrosses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Japanese and Taiwanese now use seabird mitigation measures on the high seas because it makes good economic sense. Any bycatch of seabirds has an economic impact. Obviously, if there is a bird on the line where there should be a fish worth thousands of dollars, it does not make sense to catch the bird. One of the main problems is getting adequate statistics on bird bycatch. The observer program cost $800,000 in 1995. It was suggested that observers undertake additional research, such as the use and effectiveness of mitigation measures, while on board. The use of specialist seabird observers could also accelerate technological and educational solutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee recommended that a special observer training program be introduced with traditional emphasis on seabird research. The committee also recommended that the Commonwealth government produce an easy to use guide for the identification of seabirds, to be issued to Japanese vessels&mdash;including joint venture vessels&mdash;at the time of pre&hyphen;fishing inspection. It was suggested to the committee that many of the subsidiary agreements should contain mandatory measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6924"> However, it was argued that conservation organisations, including those that had designed the tori poles and the bait throwers, had resisted making these compulsory as they believed making them voluntary would promote their use on the high seas. The committee has been told that the Japanese have not been reluctant to put in place bird mitigation measures but I am disappointed to read of the Japanese government's view at the world conversation congress in Montreal recently that they were not prepared to adopt the policy to `reduce incidental seabird mor tality to insignificant levels'. There is also some doubt as to the effectiveness of mitigation devices presently available. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

On the whole, I was also very impressed by the quality of evidence presented by the public servants involved in this area. Clearly they know their topic and they discharged their duties with professionalism.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee made a number of recommendations which were perhaps taking a different tack and had a different emphasis from that which previously had been taken, particularly in three areas. The first was in respect of the recommendation to expand the fishing exclusion zone around Tasmania to 50 nautical miles and make it uniform with the rest of Australia. The second was the recommendation to extend the period of the head agreement to remove this ongoing pressure of annual negotiations and the third was to recommend the separation of the question of port access from that of fishing quota access.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee saw great potential in the development of infrastructure in ports, particularly in Fremantle and Hobart. It is really a case of the state governments becoming involved&mdash;and there may be an avenue for the Commonwealth government. But there is a real risk of being penny wise and pound foolish in not developing the infrastructure of those ports to encourage access by the maritime industry generally. That is something that could also constructively come from our deliberations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to congratulate in particular the member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) for his efforts on the issue of bycatch. His speech indicated the extent of the bycatch. It is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> clearly unacceptable. As the member for Dickson mentioned in his speech, the view of the committee was not to reduce the bycatch of albatross to an acceptable level but, rather, to eliminate that catch.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that context I also note with some concerns the mention by the member for Dickson of the apparent unwillingness of the Japanese government at a recent conference that occurred in Montreal to acknowledge that elimination of that bycatch was a goal that had to be worked towards. I read in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on the weekend that the issue of bycatch, unfortunately, is used as an argument by the Japanese government as justifying hunting dolphins. I read with distress that 75 bottle&hyphen;nosed dolphins were:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . herded into nets, dragged from the water by crane and beheaded with a chainsaw. The carcasses were then gutted and packed in ice for the local sashimi bars, where raw fish is eaten.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Witnesses said the trapped dolphins fought ferociously in nets trying to get free. In the struggle, many were lacerated on synthetic lines.</PARA>
<PARA>The Japanese government, in answer to complaints voiced by the international community, was inclined to say, `Well, dolphins are caught anyway in the fishing industry,' and hence it was justifiable to go and hunt them. That is not justification at all. The issue of bycatch is very serious and unacceptable. The committee regarded that issue in its report with the great importance it deserved. I have pleasure in endorsing and commending the report.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Fish are a major international food resource and the Australian ocean environment is not conducive to an abundance of fish stocks. Unlike other resources, the surveillance of fish stocks is extremely difficult, particularly in regard to the important breeding stock. The collapse of the North Sea cod industry, which is as old as history, is an example of what has happened with the growth in technology in the fishing industry which now allows so much ease in identifying the availability of fish and their location. Some larger equipment is used today to fish all&hyphen;weather when in the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6925"> old days it would have been impossible to catch fish.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have often argued that possibly one of the greater conservation measures applicable to the fishing industry would be to go back to the old handline and one hook, because that method clearly sustained the fish stocks over the years. The exploitation of fish resources has been greatly expanded by that modern technology. Consequently, it is now incumbent on the governments of the world to jointly control this exploitation by agreements such as the treaty referred to in the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties before the parliament today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The benefits of the initiative of the parliament taking an interest in our treaty making processes are highlighted by our being here today and this report which has opened this issue up significantly and very profitably for the Australian industry. Issues identified in this report should become the subject of further inquiry at the national level through the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries, Resources and Rural and Regional Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue of how the Australian fishing industry can better directly utilise the quota available to Australia under the system is beyond the responsibility of the treaties committee but is of great seriousness to Australia. Under these agreements, we have some 5,000&hyphen;tonnes of catchable entitlement, yet we are neither equipped nor able to exploit that. Consequently, we find these various joint venture arrangements and others which return very little to Australia and raise other difficulties as identified in the report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wanted to use a moment of my five minutes to mention the reference in recommendation 4 to the certificate system, which is an issue I raised on a number of occasions during the inquiry. When you get down to tintacks, the only effective form of control is at the point of consumption. This was recognised many years ago with the conservation of the Australian kangaroo. Professional shooters are issued with X number of tags and no kangaroo is marketable without a tag attached. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, we have a major market to convince where tuna is either cannable at several cents a kilo or consumable as sashimi at hundreds of dollars a kilo&mdash;a fish worth tens of thousands of dollars on some occasions. That market is so attractive that, were the Japanese to cooperate with us on controlling it in a certificate or tagging system, we would see very clear international control of the exploitation of the southern bluefin and some of the other attractive sashimi tunas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Japanese have a slightly different approach and the report identifies the problems associated with the certificate system. Were we to concede to the Japanese fishing industry a slightly larger catch as part of that certificate system, we could probably still achieve a lower international catch because we would not have those outside the agreement being able to profitably market this fish. The overall result might be that, by that system and arrangement, we achieve the cooperation of the Japanese and their market and see significant reduction in the catch and the conservation of the southern bluefin tuna, which would eventually benefit everybody in hopefully a growth and re&hyphen;establishment of the breeding stock and the further availability of fish in the future. This is very important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to endorse all those comments that have been made on the seabird and the marlin bycatch. All those recommendations are well worth while and need to be considered by other committees, including the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

In the context of the Japanese utilisation of arguments about science to justify a variety of measures that are essentially decreasing the international fish resource, there is a fair argument that Australia does have to be a bit more forthright in its representations to the Japanese.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That this House expresses its concern for the future of the timber industry and rural communities dependent on it.</PARA>
<PARA>I commence by referring to a very significant ministerial statement given by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on 30 November 1995 relating to the future of our forests, which said among other things:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . as a nation we have a duty to preserve our high conservation old-growth forests and wilderness areas&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>nobody would argue with that&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Equally, we cannot as a nation undermine the confidence of an industry which is worth nearly $6 billion a year, which employs 70,000 Australians, mainly in rural and regional areas, and which has enormous potential for sustainable growth in the future.</PARA>
<PARA>What the Prime Minister said on 30 November last year was absolutely correct then and is still correct now. It is interesting that the International Union for the Conservation of Nature agreed, at its conference at Caracas in 1992, to the protection of 10 per cent of our current forests. For some unknown reason the previous Labor government, under the leadership of the then minister Senator Faulkner, decided that we would preserve 15 per cent of the forests that we had in 1750 and not 10 per cent of our current reserves. That is not very sensible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would now like to refer to the coalition's policy put forward during the election this year and which is now the policy of this government. We referred to the worthwhile objective of preserving 15 per cent of the distribution of each forest type which existed prior to European settlement. What we said about Senator Faulkner's proposition was that if we can do it we will do it, but there has to be flexibility. We went on to say in that policy:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This target will be achieved easily in some areas. Indeed, in some it has already been exceeded or is likely to be exceeded with little or no disruption to industry, employment and communities. However, in other areas, such as Northern NSW and parts of Queensland, the 15% target will be extremely difficult or impossible to achieve. In these circumstances, a Liberal-National Government will give full and proper consideration to the potential impact on people's lives, as well as the economic impact on the wider community.</PARA>
<PARA>That part of our policy is a direct quote from the Prime Minister's statement on 30 November last year. Regrettably, the forest industry in Australia, and in particular in northern New South Wales, faces absolute decimation due to the lack of supply and the lack of resource security. The federal government has provided <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6927"> the last opportunity for sustainable forestry to continue in New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recent RACAC report commissioned by the New South Wales state government, which was supposed to be an interim report, was seized upon by the New South Wales government. It unilaterally declared 12 new wilderness areas, totalling 153,430 hectares, and 10 new national parks, totalling 168,078 hectares. They have also reserved an additional 671,000 hectares of state forests from logging for future assessment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is very appropriate that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Anderson, has made it clear that the Commonwealth was particularly concerned about those new wilderness area and national park declarations and the further reductions in resource supply to industry during the comprehensive original assessment process and the so-called five by five quota guarantees. He is quite right to be concerned about that. The reality is that state forest groups did not know of many of the new national parks before they were declared, but some of the environmental groups not only knew the details of them but also had the maps of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What concerns me is the lack of credible scientific research into the new national parks. I ask the New South Wales state government: who did the assessments? A lot of people in my area believe that those assessments of wilderness areas were carried out by unqualified university students. I would like to know whether that is true. I would not be surprised because I recall that a major assessment funded by Senator Faulkner when he was the minister was done by people without stated qualifications and with thanks to Natalie. Honourable members might remember this because I highlighted it at the time.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AE4">Mr NEHL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. We need to know who did those assessments. If those RACAC proposals are adopted by the New South Wales government, as much as 80 per cent of our forests will be lost. We have had a forest industry in this country for decades. In northern New South Wales, which I know extreme <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> ly well, the state forest organisations have managed the forests marvellously. It has been sustainable forestry with jobs with the environment preserved as well. We need to make sure that the flexibility that the honourable minister has already spoken about is observed so that we do not lock our forest areas into a situation where jobs are totally lost.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The extent of the areas set aside for further assessment means early cutting of regrowth. We are not allowed to take any decent size trees, so we have to go into plantation areas 15 or 20 years too early and cut down timber that is not big enough to do the job, that is not appropriate. Not only are we not able to satisfy the need for timber right now, but we are also creating an enormous problem down the track because we are cutting stuff that should not be cut for 20 or 25 years. What are we going to do when what is supposed to be cut has already been taken? The early regrowth cut that is taking place now will take at least 15 to 20 years to recover from.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quota mills have had their quotas cut by 50 per cent for the next five years, yet they are expected to expand and invest in value adding. It is not on. Unless there is some resource security, how can they spend the vast amounts of money that are required? Salvage mills&mdash;the mills that take the smaller timber that is used for pallets and palings&mdash;have no guarantee of supply. Previously they operated under an annual licence. Now they do not even have an annual licence to go by.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Five North Coast salvage mills in the Dorrigo area pay $1.4 million in royalties to State Forests, but are unsure whether they are going to be able to keep operating. Has the state government done anything to consider how they are going to replace the royalties which they are losing? The annual Dorrigo quota has been reduced from 58,000 cubic metres to 15,000 cubic metres&mdash;almost a 75 per cent reduction. The quota price per cubic metre varies between $30 and $55&mdash;an average price of $42.50. In the Dorrigo area, the average royalties paid to State Forests will be reduced from $2,465,000 to $637,000&mdash;an enormous drop, just in one little area. I am referring to Dorrigo because it is a prime example, but the same situation applies right <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6928"> across the forest areas. Wages for Dorrigo district forest operations in 1995-96 were $25 million. At a 50 per cent reserve option, those wages will drop to $5 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another area to which the New South Wales government has given no consideration is the number of cattle that are grazed in state forests. Of course, people who are not aware of this would not know about it. This is the only land that these cattle have to graze on, and the farmers are operating under leases. There is no consideration of the 10,700 cattle in the Grafton rural lands area and another 8,000 in the Glen Innes area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have to do is make sure that the forest industries of Australia are sustainable, that they have flexibility, and that we do not continue down this mad path&mdash;advanced by Senator Faulkner and followed up by the New South Wales Labor government&mdash;of shutting up the forests, killing the towns that depend on them and putting people out of work. People and jobs are just as important as the environment and forests.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That this House expresses its concern for the future of the timber industry and rural communities dependent on it.</PARA>
<PARA>This issue of forestry and the importance of the industry to our economy will not go away. Since I was elected in 1993 I have been working with forestry groups to come up with some solutions for a sustainable forest industry. Sustainability is not just allowing large amounts of woodchips to be shipped overseas. It means that we must look at all levels of the industry, from the work in the forests selecting areas for harvesting to the preparation of the ground for replanting, the protection of the soil against erosion, the care and maintenance for growing young trees, the harvesting, the training that we need and the training in the new ways that we are doing things, the sorting of the timber, and the downstream processing and value adding. That is when a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> lot of our rural and regional communities will gain the most&mdash;when we add more to our forestry process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am from Tasmania, which has 3.2 million hectares covered by native forests&mdash;about half of the total land area of the state. We have been particularly diligent in ensuring that our forests are properly harvested and maintained. Thirty per cent of this area is available for wood production.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The national forest policy statement and the regional forestry agreements are ideal tools for fostering investment in value adding in the forest industries. I have been very disappointed in the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) for not so far being able to deliver investment in forest based industries. There is a real disappointment that the statements that have been delivered have not gone to the heart of adding value. To every industry and every raw resource we have, we must add value. Rural Australia needs to have investment in value adding to ensure that we get the most value for one of our prime resources and not just make it an easy path for the export of unprocessed forest products. We have done that in the past with commodities, and still do. We are a great exporter of commodities. But the time has come to add value wherever we can.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hardwood based forest industries are substantially more significant to Tasmania's economy than they are to other states' economies. In 1994-95, according to the summary report of the Tasmania&hyphen;Commonwealth regional forestry agreement, the hardwood based industries contributed just over eight per cent of the state's gross state product. The direct and indirect contribution was estimated at about 17 per cent of GSP in 1989. Since then, there has been a steady growth of our forest based industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well, the industry directly employs 6,580 people, and if you add the downstream processing and related sectors the potential of this industry is great. For a state that has such high consistent unemployment&mdash;10.7 per cent this year&mdash;we cannot afford to throw away opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Investment in the forest industry can also mean assistance to revitalising our country <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6929"> and our regional communities. The summary report also states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Residents living in communities which are highly dependent on the forest industry were concerned about employment for themselves and their children.</PARA>
<PARA>We know that those who live in timber communities&mdash;and you would know this in your own seat, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl&mdash;go on to work in the industry for generations, but we have to get into the new training and the new ways as there are a lot of new things to do in the timber and forest industries. Such communities were afraid that many further reductions in key industry sectors would act to affect the physical and social infrastructure of their area. But to encourage companies, big and small, to invest or to expand in Tasmania requires the federal government's commitment to ensure that some incentive is put into Tasmania or, indeed, anywhere else in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tasmania has heard endless discussions on the proposed pulp mill to be built, and a feasibility study is being done at the present moment, but the incentives for investment look pretty bleak. Take as an example the budget cutbacks that have caused many industries to look to invest not only in other states but also in other countries. The $600 million cut from national road funding can also have an effect on an operation like that. There has been a $1.8 million cut from labour market programs. Much of this money was spent in rural and regional areas where the market is not providing the opportunities for people to gain jobs. Those labour market programs were used in Tasmania to get some retraining and the new ways of training people in the forest based industries. We used some of that money in those areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The abolition of bounties will really hurt the newly emerging industries in Tasmania, the very ones we need to get job growth in the state. There is also the impact of cuts to the financial assistance grants that help to support and maintain our infrastructure&mdash;some $30 million over three years. This leads to apprentices not being taken on, expansion of companies not being encouraged and research and development being lost to Australia.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many overseas countries are offering R&amp;D opportunities at 100 per cent, 150 per cent and, I also understand, at 200 per cent, and other tax breaks. So, by cutting our R&amp;D opportunities to 125 per cent, we are really no longer in the market. By merely extending the woodchip licences for three years instead of one is not going to solve the problem. The regional forest agreements must be pursued with great vigour around the states and finalised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those areas that must be reserved for one reason or another to ensure sustainability of the quality of the forest and its health should also be completed. Areas that were identified as being in the eastern coastal zone and the peppermint country need to be finally assessed and compensation organised. Many are still waiting to know whether they can use their land, whether they can clear their land or whether they will receive compensation if the government wants the land for a reserve. Those areas need to be finalised and finalised reasonably quickly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A quick turnaround process is needed for compensation so that it does not last for years and years. Many farmers have been waiting to finalise their farm plans and many may even have to relocate their farms if too much of their land is cut or taken away. There are many issues that need to be pulled together until we are out of the woods, so to speak. There is no other industry that can be brought into play to replace this one and the role it plays; nor would we want to replace it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Tasmania is the cleanest, disease free grower of the best salmon in the world, and I hope that will not change, so can we be the cleanest, disease free timber producer to the world&mdash;and not only in timber but also in downstreaming the waste wood to develop a whole range of goods. Already, Tasmania exports in printing and writing paper more than half the nation's total export earnings in this category. Now we need to include fine timbers, furniture and kraft paper, plus develop the skills of craftspeople to go with them.</PARA>

I am concerned about what this government will do to ensure that it is sustainable, that people are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6930"> compensated properly where reserves are taken out, that we have incentives to ensure investment in the industry is kept up, that the downstream processing for the industry&mdash;the modernisation of the industry&mdash;will take place and that the government will give incentive to that happening and will give the opportunities for our companies that are presently in it to continue in it. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to speak in favour of this motion moved by the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl). Like the member for Cowper, I too represent an electorate that has&mdash;or, should I say, had&mdash;a significant hardwood industry. The impact on those towns that have relied heavily on that industry has been devastating. The great tragedy in all of this is it did not have to be. There is no good scientific reason for what has gone on over the past decade or, more particularly, for what has gone on over the past five years. History will eventually judge the governments who are responsible very harshly, I am sure&mdash;and so it should.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen the greatest con. We have seen the emotions of urban dwellers whipped up into a frenzy such that the perception was created that forestry was a bad industry. As a result, we have seen the spectacle of the so-called conservationists leaving their comfortable city houses&mdash;houses which probably have plenty of hardwood in them&mdash;to travel to the country for the adventure of protesting against the forestry industry and, of course, resuming those comfortable urban jobs upon their return, for those who had jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These people have little knowledge of just how forest management works and they are not really interested either. Although their organisers claim they support a sustainable industry, their actions are otherwise. As the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) said recently:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They have one objective: the cessation of all logging in native forests. Governments should not kid themselves otherwise. It is a fact. It is there in black and white, for example in the Australian Conservation Foundation's forest policy adopted by its council in May 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">What this means of course, is that governments ought to treat with healthy scepticism any state <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> ments by groups such as the ACF that imply they support native forest industry or even the objectives of the national forest policy statement.</PARA>
<PARA>Through the actions of such groups, a generation of myths and misinformation about the management of our forests has been built up, with the end result being the former labour government making political decision after political decision in an attempt to win the votes of the so-called conservationists, who are predominantly in urban seats&mdash;all at the expense of our rural communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is so frustrating to visit towns like Eden and Bombala and witness the impact that those decisions have had on the people&mdash;hardworking, honest people thrown out of work. But the former Labor government, in their usual socialist way, said, `Don't worry. We will look after you.' `Look after you' means, `Pay you some money and make you dependent on the government.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No wonder the previous government was going out the back door financially. Here was an industry that had the capacity to be sustainable, an industry in which we were already importing more timber products than we were exporting and they went all out to close it right down so that our trade deficit got worse&mdash;plus the fact that more money had to be made available to pay the people not to work. No wonder there were such large swings against Labor in March. People did not want handouts; they wanted jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At least we have started to turn this around. But the Labor Party still does not understand. When we brought in new export woodchip regulations, they were based on science rather than politics. The Labor Party opposed them. And what did the union, the CFMEU, say about such a move by Labor? To quote Trevor Smith of that union in a press release:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ALP's lack of understanding of the importance of the forest and forest products industry to regional Australia coupled with its willingness to use the industry as a political football will ensure that voters, especially those in regional Australia, will continue to keep the ALP in opposition.</PARA>
<PARA>At least the union understands the impact on the communities, as much as we also understand that the battle from here on is with the Carr Labor government in New South Wales&mdash;Carr, who thinks that NSW stands for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6931"> Newcastle, Sydney and Wollongong. Be assured: we will battle to protect our towns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we complete the regional forest agreement process, the Commonwealth will be ensuring that the social impact on communities will go to the top of the priority list, not the bottom. As Patrick Moore, a founder of Greenpeace, recently stated:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am speaking on this motion to add my support for efforts to maintain high levels of employment in the timber industry. Timber communities in New South Wales range from the Victorian border to the Queensland border. Major timber centres include Eden in the south&hyphen;east and Grafton in the north. Large towns like these are usually surrounded by smaller hamlets which subsist almost entirely on timber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In New South Wales, a report on the social impact of the logging debate was undertaken by the Resource and Conservation Assessment Council for the state's interim assessment process. This study revealed that timber communities were suffering enormous levels of internal stress which related directly to potential job losses. The report also confirmed something which the CFMEU said&mdash;and I am pleased to see that the role of the CFMEU has been recognised by speakers on the other side&mdash;whose research had also previously found that many workers who lost their jobs following the 1982 decision not to log in certain areas are still out of work some 14 years later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is in the smaller rural hamlets that the effects are most noticeable. When mills close in these hamlets, long periods of unemployment follow. The reason for this prolonged period of unemployment is that, in some sections of the industry, relatively low levels of numeracy and literacy exist which impact severely on the potential of retrenched workers to access alternative employment.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When a mill closes, there are major secondary effects in local businesses due to the withdrawal of a significant level of the local economy's disposable interest. This leads to further job losses through an imposed and localised recession, which means that local employment opportunities in other industries such as retail become much more scarce. The Labor movement, I must emphasise, supports a balanced environmental policy which protects the forests and the environment but also recognises the needs of the workers in the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now refer to the New South Wales government's Resource and Conservation Assessment Council's social impact study. This study clearly details the vulnerability of New South Wales country towns and the effect that logging restrictions have on local communities. This interim forestry assessment process is to identify forests that may be set aside from the logging so that they remain options for inclusion in a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All the five timber towns included in the study have been experiencing economic stagnation for a number of years. In some cases, this is directly related to the timber industry, such as in Wauchope and Bulahdelah. In other cases, the timber industry is just one factor, such as in Narooma and Kempsey. However, the experience of a stagnating economy is something they all have in common.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While it could turn out that actual job losses in several of these towns will be gradual and may affect a relatively small proportion of the work force, continuing uncertainty and lack of information have outcomes of their own, including helplessness and fear, lack of confidence and lack of hope.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In general, unemployment in timber towns is higher than the New South Wales average. Among the unemployed group are a considerable group of long&hyphen;term unemployed people. In many cases, townspeople are apt to say that they have given up. As these are the least skilled amongst the work force, they are regarded as having left the work force forever.   </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6932">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Aboriginal community, in particular, suffers in periods of high unemployment.

There were varying interpretations of exactly where and the location of the possible landing shifted from north&hyphen;central Australia to other parts of Australia. At one stage the most likely touchdown point was going to be somewhere near Tibooburra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of emergency arrangements were set in train. I want to thank the defence authorities and also the atomic energy authorities for the advice that was given. As things turned out, it having seemed likely for some time that it would touch down in Australia and that some of the debris may have exposed Australian citizens to risk&mdash;a matter the government had to take contingency arrangements against, and I did take the opportunity of briefing the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and also the Premier of Queensland and the Premier of New South Wales on the circumstances of the matter&mdash;in the final analysis, we were advised by the American authorities that the debris had impacted in the south&hyphen;west Pacific, some 1,300 miles west of Santiago, at 12.34 p.m. eastern summer time.

How can the minister now claim that the same worker will not be worse off after receiving a mere $8 per week wage increase each year? In fact, after three years won't the same worker be receiving about $1,000 less per year under the Howard government's proposal?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="6936" SPEAKER="Reith, Peter, MP" NAMEID="WI4" ELECTORATE="Flinders" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Industrial Relations" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased that the government, as the Prime Minister made very clear yesterday, will make a submission to the Industrial Relations Commission supporting a pay increase for the low paid in the context of the living wage application made by the ACTU to the Industrial Relations Commission. It is unequivocally a complete fulfilment of the promises that we made in the last election in our support for people who are low paid and, as the Prime Minister said yesterday, completely rebuts the scare campaign constantly run by the Labor Party that the coalition government would not support pay increases. We support this pay increase because it is fair and reasonable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the Opposition refers to statements I made back in June 1995, which I do not resile from. In fact, I have a copy of the press release which I issued at that time. The point I made at that very point in time was that Labor's accord deals had constantly produced for low income people reductions in their real wages&mdash;because that was your system in operation. What incredible gall for the Labor Party to talk to us about the wages of the low paid when their system for years and years not only delivered reductions in real wages for ordinary workers but, in fact, left a lot of them unemployed as a result. The point I made at that time was that also other aspects of the accord bore careful scrutiny. The government then announced a `strong commitment' to workplace bargaining but immediately broke the commitment by providing for across&hyphen;the&hyphen;board increases in various sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6937"> The point needs to be made that not only are we supporting the jurisdiction of the commission to grant safety net wage increas es, not only are we putting up a fair and reasonable figure for the low paid, but on top of that we are making the big structural changes in the system which, genuinely, will give people the opportunity at work to sit down and come to a deal which can underpin real wage increases in the future, instead of the fraudulent claims you made year in year out, offering illusory dollars soon lost and wiped away by tax increases and through the CPI as it operated under Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, if you look at C14, which was the lowest of the metal industry award numbers under that arrangement, the figure actually represents about 2.3 per cent. That is a figure very much commensurate with the CPI, now running at about 2.1 per cent; so in fact it maintains real living wages for those particular employees. But, with the big system changes that we have in place, it really provides people with the prospect of real wage gains across the economy as we pick up the productivity benefits of the package which the government has in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lastly, let me say that that is, of course, without reference to the other benefits of the government's program also being put in place, which will provide significant improvements in conditions for the low paid. You only have to look at the tremendous benefits for the low paid who are purchasing their own homes with the reduction in interest rates since 2 March&mdash;something you were never able to deliver. On the figures which the Treasurer has, you are looking at about 140 bucks a month for the average family.</PARA>

For years and years you people have claimed that you represent the ordinary, low paid working Australian, but the fact is for years and years you betrayed the trust of those people and they are worse off as a result.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, my question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Given the fact that some countries have been considering sending troops to help restore stability in Zaire, what is the position of the Australian government, and are we likely to contribute to any international efforts?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="6937" SPEAKER="Howard, John, MP" NAMEID="ZD4" ELECTORATE="Bennelong" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Prime Minister" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, in answer to the honourable member for Groom, it is true that last week, as a result of the initiative of a number of countries, proposals were set in train for the establishment of a multinational force to be commanded by Canada and agreed initially to include detachments from the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Italy and a number of other countries. Subsequently that force received what is known as a chapter 7 mandate from the United Nations Security Council.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since then, however, there has, by all of the news reports and all of the intelligence guidance, been a very dramatic change in the situation on the ground in Zaire and Rwanda. Last Thursday the situation changed very dramatically. The Hutu militia were separated from the refugees they had controlled by other Tutsi forces in Zaire, and they appear to have moved or fled westward. That has allowed the movement of unarmed refugees back into Rwanda. The best estimates so far are that more than 400,000 people have gone through the checkpoint at Goma and re&hyphen;entered Rwanda. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6938">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are still some 600,000 refugees at various locations in Zaire. The initial indications are that the refugees returning to Rwanda will be welcomed back by the government of that country, although it has to be said at this early stage that the situation which itself changed so dramatically a few days ago could, in turn, change very dramatically again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are mixed views in the world community about what should now be the appropriate response. Some will argue that the original purpose of the multinational force was to create a corridor so that relief could be got through to the refugees. Now that their tormentors have been driven away and the refugees have been able to return to Rwanda, many&mdash;including some people in the Rwandan government&mdash;are arguing that the presence of foreign troops, a multinational force, is no longer needed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia for her part has continued to follow the situation very closely. We have been in regular consultation with the Canadians, the United Nations and the United States. At this moment it is a situation which is too fluid and too unpredictable for Australia to make a definite decision as to what kind of commitment, if any, ought to be made, particularly when the circumstances of the force to which we might be committing is itself a matter of very significant doubt. Australia has a very proud record, I might say, under governments of both political persuasions, of making very fine contributions to peacekeeping and other activities of that kind, and the disposition would, of course, be on the part of the government to look at the merits of any proposal that may be before us according to the circumstances as we assess them at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can merely report to the House that we continue to have a very active watching brief on the situation. I hope from a humanitarian point of view the early signs that the refugees are being received back into their former homeland in a peaceful, welcoming fashion turns out to be the lasting situation. It had all the dimensions of one of the great human tragedies of this century. The people of that area have already suffered immensely&mdash;more than a million died in the genocide of 1994&mdash; <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and anything that people can do to relieve the suffering of this fragment of humanity is very welcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has already provided about $2.6 million in aid. Most of that money&mdash;in fact, I think all of it&mdash;will go to non&hyphen;government organisations which are doing a remarkably effective job in the area. Australia stands ready to consider further contributions of that kind according to the circumstances as they arise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian defence forces have been instructed to take precautionary measures to shorten the deployment time if that were to become necessary. I have in mind there that a number of defence personnel will be undergoing inoculations against the diseases that are present in that area so that, if a decision to commit Australian units in different capacities is taken in the future, because of those precautionary measures, the deployment time can thereby be shortened.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. I refer to the case of a principal technical officer under the metal trades industry award whose award rate of pay is $691.50 per week. Isn't it the case that under the government's industrial relations regime any such worker who is unable to win a wage increase under enterprise bargaining will receive no wage increase at all over the next three years? Doesn't this mean that these workers' real wages will fall by approximately $50 per week over the next three years?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="6938" SPEAKER="Reith, Peter, MP" NAMEID="WI4" ELECTORATE="Flinders" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Industrial Relations" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The simple schema which the government has been advocating is that what we should have in place is a safety net for the low paid. What we are saying to the Industrial Relations Commission is that, in their maintenance of a genuine safety net for the low paid, there ought to be a cut&hyphen;off point at which, and below which, the low paid receive the benefit of that award increase. Clearly, for those who are above the safety net, over time their wages position ought to be the subject of agreement making with their employer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the system we are trying to construct. In fact, that is the system that Paul <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6939"> Keating said was a good idea back in 1993. And what happened after he said that? The ACTU, and basically three&hyphen;quarters of the front bench who came out of the union movement, did him over, because the last thing you wanted was a system where you had agreement making as being the key, if you like, to higher productivity and therefore the underpinning of better wages growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why don't you wake up to the reality that the centralised system, which you ran for years and years and which the ACTU prevented you from walking away from, failed to provide people with the real increases in wages which you claim that you have been supporting for years? That is the fact of the matter. One of the big changes that Australia needs to undertake if people are going to have higher wages in the future is that we get away from this idea that the Industrial Relations Commission can have a hearing in Sydney or Melbourne, wave a magic wand and say that everybody gets a pay increase regardless of their circumstances. Rhetorically, in principle, your former Prime Minister supported that proposition. Clearly, from the assumption behind your question, you have now regressed from the position which he publicly advanced back in 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We make no apology for saying that what we ought to have in the wages system is a fair set of minimum conditions under the jurisdiction and the responsibility of the Industrial Relations Commission, but beyond that people ought to be responsible for their own terms and conditions and thus be given an incentive to sit down and directly negotiate their terms and conditions with their employer. That is the way ahead. You publicly in the past supported that and, if we are now seeing a regression in your policy position, it is about time you came clear with it.</PARA></ANSWER>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prime Minister, you referred to ordinary workers being better off as a result of recent interest rate reductions. Is it not a fact that, according to recent ABS household expenditure data, only one in seven households earning up to average weekly earnings are paying off mortgages and the others cannot hope to benefit directly from any interest rate cuts? As far as after tax earnings are concerned, isn't it also the case that under your budget ordinary families are going to be paying more for prescriptions, more for doctors' fees as they move out of bulk billing, more for child care, more for nursing homes and home care support for the elderly, much more for higher education fees and more for private health insurance?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am absolutely fascinated that the Leader of the Opposition has brought higher education fees into the argument. The higher education system that you are defending is a system that duds the low income earners of Australia. You are, at heart, for the elite system which sort of says that the taxes of the working men and women of Australia can be used to subsidise free education for high income earners. I hope you repeat that dogma at the next election in 2&half; years time because it is a long way out of touch. You ran that one in Lindsay, too, and they didn't take too much notice of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say to the Leader of the Opposition that of course it is a fact that not everybody has a housing mortgage&mdash;but a lot of people <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6942"> do. It is also a fact that most people have housing mortgages at a time when they have peak demand on their household income so far as expenses are concerned. At a time when they are raising children they have a mortgage on the house and that is the time they really need relief.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might also remind you that the tax relief contained in the budget extends to a number of groups that you systematically kicked in the shins before the last election, including the self&hyphen;funded retirees of Australia. What have we done? We have delivered on our promises&mdash;and we will be delivering further on our promises. They are amongst very low income people, too. We are delivering on our promises in relation to the tax threshold and in relation to the health insurance rebate. We are delivering general taxation reductions to two million Australian families. You cannot get away from the fact that on 1 January next year, despite all your best efforts to obscure the fact, there will be a tax break for the families of Australia to the tune of $1 billion. That is going to people who are paying off homes and to people who are in rented accommodation&mdash;and nothing can alter the fact that under this government the promises made to the working men and women of Australia have been delivered in spades.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can report to the House that the public has thoroughly endorsed this government's economic strategy and thoroughly welcomed the second cut in official interest rates under the Howard Liberal&hyphen;National government. As a result of that, not only have we seen two cuts in official interest rates but a three&hyphen;quarter per cent cut in the standard variable mortgage as a result of increased competitive pressures. I can report to the House that in response to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> those cuts in interest rates, delivering to families and delivering to mortgage buyers in Australia, there has been a sharp rise in consumer confidence which was noted by Westpac in its release of 13 November 1996, saying that the increase in November of the Westpac&hyphen;Melbourne Institute index of consumer sentiment of 8.4 points or 8.3 per cent was the strongest immediate response to a rate cut recorded since March 1991. That is the response of consumers and home buyers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also seen attempts by the Labor Party to talk down consumer confidence. Shortly before that largest jump since 1991 the shadow Treasurer was saying there was no consumer confidence in the Australian economy. We see in relation to all these indicators that, whilst the bulk of the Australian public recognises the benefit of good economic policy, there is a small, marginalised, increasingly bitter and disaffected group that is opposed to them. That bitter and disaffected, marginal, small group is known by the name `the Australian Labor Party'. One has never seen longer faces than the faces of members of the Australian Labor Party when there is an interest rate cut. The Australian public will welcome this with glee and the Australian Labor Party will go into periods of mourning. They will predict consumer confidence downturns when there are consumer confidence uplifts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is about the fourth question in question time and normally we have a question about credit card interest rates by this time. On 4 November the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said that the government had a feather duster in relation to credit cards. He said that informal monitoring was not working. Three days later, on 7 November 1996, St George became the first to cut personal loan rates, credit card rates and overdrafts&mdash;some feather duster. You predict a downturn in consumer confidence and you have the biggest increase since 1991. You say nothing is happening on credit cards and three days later credit card rates start falling. This is the Basil Fawlty of economic commentary.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All we can say is that, as the faces of the Australian Labor Party get longer, the prospects for the Australian public get brighter. The great thing about this opposition&mdash;the one thing that can be said in their defence&mdash;is that at least nobody takes any notice of them.

<ANSWER PAGE="6944" SPEAKER="Reith, Peter, MP" NAMEID="WI4" ELECTORATE="Flinders" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Industrial Relations" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for his question. As I have already informed the House, we will certainly be making a submission to the commission for an increase in the safety net. In making our decision, we took into account all the relevant factors, including what was a fair thing for the low paid in terms of remuneration, the changed nature of the system, reflecting that we now see this as a genuine safety net.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also were very concerned to make sure that it was a responsible decision economically because we want to do all that we can to preserve the jobs people have today and preferably give people the opportunity of work in the future. Fixing that safety net at a responsible level, which ultimately is a decision for the Industrial Relations Commission, is very important because Australia does have a significant unemployment rate. This government is determined to do all that it can to reduce unemployment and to create jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That attitude that we take is in very stark contrast to the application lodged by the ACTU, which really is disappointing in that it is just a return to the same old centralised approach to industrial relations which undermined Australia's competitive position and led over the years to a decline in real wages, particularly for the low paid, and generally meant for the Australian economy that we were not able to achieve the better economic growth that most Australians would like to see. In short, the implications of the ACTU's claim&mdash;which I would have to say is a bit of an ambit claim&mdash;if granted, would be a big jump in the rate of inflation, jeopardise a lot of jobs and see people over time lose the prospects of employment.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have gone to some lengths to look at these issues in detail. We have had the Treasury do some preliminary work on the ACTU claim. Allowing for the necessary monetary response to keep the underlying inflation rate within its target range of two to three per cent on average over the business cycle, the impact of that claim in terms of the first stage of it would increase the unemployment rate by a quarter of a percentage point in 1997&hyphen;98 and half a percentage point in 1998&hyphen;99 and in 1999&hyphen;2000. It would cause a cumulative loss of GDP growth of 2&frac14; percentage points over these three financial years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The preliminary advice we have shows that the effect of all three stages of the ACTU's claim would be even bigger. It would mean a rise in the unemployment rate of a quarter of a percentage point in 1997&hyphen;98, a rise of one percentage point in 1998&hyphen;99 and a rise of 1&frac34; percentage points in 1999&hyphen;2000. It would mean overall for the economy a cumulative loss of GDP growth of five percentage points from 1997&hyphen;98 to 1999&hyphen;2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What that shows you, on reasonable assumptions, is that if the ACTU's claim got up it would be, in a word, a disaster for the low paid and a disaster for the Australian economy. It is interesting that behind the sole question I have had from the shadow minister on this issue is an assumption which is dictated by the ACTU&mdash;that is, your policy is now back to across&hyphen;the&hyphen;board centralised wage making for the Australian economy. That does not surprise me because that is basically the ACTU's claim.

There is no doubt that there are significant benefits for both employers and employees as a result of the historic announcement by the Victorian government for the referral of industrial relations powers to the Commonwealth. For employers it means that we will have a much more simplified and settled system. That means that they will no longer have to waste resources on contesting jurisdictional issues or using two systems for their workplace relations. That is good for employees as well.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The argument that employers who locate their businesses in Victoria will only have to deal with one industrial relations system will be an attractive one particularly to foreign employers who understandably find the present constitutional system bewildering.</PARA>
<PARA>The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph </EMPHASIS> picked up the message as well. They said in their editorial:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yesterday's first steps towards a single industrial relations system across the nation should be whipped into a gallop. The in principle deal for Victoria to refer its industrial relations powers to the Federal Government opens the way for big savings.</PARA>
<PARA>Then, Prime Minister, you will be interested in a very measured tone from the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald&hyphen;Sun</EMPHASIS> . They said in their editorial:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This economic reform signals a major step forward in the Howard government's determination to change forever the relationship between employees <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and management. Employers and workers will be able to make wage deals once federal awards are stripped back to a safety net of employment entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA>Then, in a very understated expression, they said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new federal legislation, coupled with the Kennett government handover, will begin an era of structural change that neither the Hawke nor Keating governments could ever have achieved, irrespective of their alliances with unions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The changes will bring productivity increases where individual workers will achieve workplace efficiencies as a result of wage productivity deals. Big gains will also flow to workers presently employed under state based agreements.</PARA>
<PARA>Lastly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Merged as a uniform workplace package, the new federal legislation, coupled with the changes agreed to by Prime Minister Howard and Premier Kennett, provide a fine Christmas present to this state and the nation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. The honourable member for Boothby shows an enduring interest not just in international relations but <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> also in issues of development assistance, which I particularly appreciate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a very serious matter. Obviously the Australian government felt under obligation to respond in a humanitarian way to the crisis that has erupted in Zaire and Rwanda. I announced last Thursday that the government would, as an initial contribution, spend $2.6 million of development assistance money on assistance to Australian non-government organisations which have experience in dealing with the general Great Lakes region&mdash;Zaire and Rwanda in particular.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have decided to provide $300,000 each to Community Aid Abroad, to World Vision, to Medecins Sans Frontieres and to Care Australia and $200,000 to the Adventist Development Relief Agency, to Caritas&mdash;Australian Catholic Relief&mdash;to Austcare and to UNICEF Australia. These contributions are being made by the government in response to a visit by the Director&hyphen;General of AusAID, Mr Trevor Kanaley, to Nairobi, which was the best place from which an assessment could be made of the needs in Zaire. Mr Kanaley visited Nairobi at my request. He then provided me with a report on what we could do from our development assistance program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His assessment&mdash;and I accepted his recommendations&mdash;was that the best we could do was not to provide food and other supplies because food and other supplies are already available at an adequate level, but to provide logistic support to NGOs to distribute those food and other supplies. So that is why, as an initial contribution, we have decided to provide the $2.6 million. I emphasise that this is an initial contribution. Depending on circumstances, the government will be prepared to provide additional funds later on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation has changed somewhat in Zaire since the weekend, as the Prime Minister mentioned. Something like 400,000&mdash;perhaps up to 500,000&mdash;refugees have now returned from Zaire to Rwanda. As a consequence of that, AusAID is now liaising again with non-government organisations to see whether some of the development assistance that we are proposing for this particular situation could be redirected to resettlement programs. So we are obviously <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6948"> keeping a fairly flexible approach to how we respond to this humanitarian disaster.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Suffice to say that the Australian government is determined to do all that it can in a practical way to assist. We are doing that through the development assistance program by providing the $2.6 million. We may well provide more, depending on circumstances. I hope that the flow of the refugees back into Rwanda is going to continue and, if that is the case, I do not think there is any doubt that some, if not all, of this money would be used to assist with the process of resettlement.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BT4">Dr KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Wide Bay for his question. A report has come into the hands of the government detailing once again the failure and ineffectiveness of the previous government's Working Nation programs. This report is a damning indictment of the Working Nation program. It is based on a survey of employers in six regions in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland. It is a report that the previous government <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6949"> may well have decided to act upon but decided to do nothing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members of the House will be very interested to know the weaknesses of the previous program which have made it necessary for the present government to introduce the vital and important reforms which it has now put forward. First of all, employers said that the programs of Working Nation were ineffective. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The initiatives are perceived as being short-term measures when long-term strategies are required.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>How true that was&mdash;a short&hyphen;term measure in the run&hyphen;up to the federal election this year. Employers felt that the programs were inefficient and wasteful. The report said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Employers felt that the government was uninterested in putting resources into new skill areas because of the longer time required to impart the required knowledge and skills.</PARA>
<PARA>Employers were also highly critical of the quality of training being offered in the many short&hyphen;term schemes so favoured by the previous government. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Employers are never sure of the exact skill levels of someone completing different training courses. The employer still needed to test or substantiate the skills of these graduates.</PARA>
<PARA>It will be no surprise to members of this House that a consistent complaint throughout this report was that many of the long&hyphen;term unemployed were functionally illiterate. This is a damning indictment of the failed education policies of the previous government. Many of those young people who went through under those policies are now unemployed and long&hyphen;term unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the employers slammed the irrelevance of many of these training programs to meet the individual needs of the people involved. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unemployed people appear to be able to take training courses that are inconsistent with their career goals, simply for something to do. Employers talked about interviewing people who had completed multiple training courses in completely unrelated areas. One employer talked about a woman who had  completed a clown training course as well as an office skills course but she wanted to work in child care.</PARA>
<PARA>I have got nothing against clowns, and this course was probably put up to train members <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the Labor Party frontbench&mdash;and probably many of them have been through that course and are showing the consequences of it. But this woman wanted to be in child care, yet she was not allowed to be in child care; she was forced into another course because the $2 billion man had to get the numbers up to make sure he could hide these unemployed people from the statistics in the run&hyphen;up to the election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is because of these complete failures and the ineffectiveness of the Working Nation programs that the government is putting in place programs such as the modern Australian apprenticeship and traineeship system which will lead young people on to real jobs and is bringing about major reforms in the labour market programs next year, which will give major incentives for the placement of unemployed people in real jobs and give them a start on the careers that they really want to take.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8E4">Dr WOOLDRIDGE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. Aboriginal Australians have the worst health status of any identifiable group of people in the country. Their life expectancy is somewhere between 15 and 20 years less than that for average Australians. A few months ago, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare released a report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's Health 1996</EMPHASIS>  that looked at the changes in the health of the Australian population over the years 1992 to 1994. While the health of Australians generally had improved over that period, the health of Aboriginal people had stayed the same. So in fact the gap in health between the Aboriginal population and the broader population actually widened over the period 1992 to 1994. The worst was for men, particularly in the 25 to 54 age group, where their death rate was five to seven times that of the rest of the population.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part of any answer to this is access to reasonable, professional health care. We have had improvements in childhood health, although Aboriginal children still have a death <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6951"> rate of three times that of the broader population. The other part of health is a very substantial effort in environmental health. It is estimated that perhaps more than 300 communities of 50 people or more do not have access to basic safe, clean water that would meet standards of the National Health and Medical Research Council. This leads to a particular range of infections of the skin, intestine, urinary tract, kidneys and trachoma. It can lead to kidney disease through repeated infections and possibly through the high mineral content of the water.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs announced last week that we will be using the army to assist Aboriginal communities in providing skilled labour for interventions to help supply clean water. It does not replace the need for good health care but it does supplement it. We are aware that the provision of clean water needs adequate planning as well as adequate follow-up training of the people. This is where the states and territories will be involved. The army's involvement will allow the acceleration of the environmental health work already being done by ATSIC. The faster we can get clean water into all Aboriginal communities, the better value that we will get for the health dollar and the faster improvement of the health of Aboriginal Australians.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, my question relates to the address by US President Clinton in this chamber on Wednesday. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> What consideration have you, Mr Speaker, given to the position in the chamber from which the guest should speak? Will you ensure a welcoming address by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition? Would you accept that a standing ovation, subject to members' and senators' inclination, is appropriate? Will you consider proceedings and practices adopted on Wednesday as a precedent for similar invitations to other distinguished visitors to Australia as well as distinguished Australians who are not themselves members or senators?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="10000">Mr SPEAKER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question. Many issues have been considered in relation to the forthcoming visit of President Clinton. President Clinton will enter the chamber and sit on my right on a podium that is raised six or seven inches from the ground. I will be joined by the President of the Senate on my left on a podium of similar dimensions. They will both sit on plain Commonwealth of Australia chairs, which you are very familiar with in the hallways and byways of the parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The President will be received by both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, who will welcome him very briefly. Consideration was given to exactly where the President would address the joint sitting from. Those who were here historically would remember that President Bush rose from his chair and addressed the joint sitting on my right. We have looked at this very carefully and have decided that the President will address us from a position directly in front of me, between the Clerk of the House of Representatives on my right and the Clerk of the Senate on my left.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think standing ovations are the subject of atmospherics and sometimes whimsy and a whole host of other competing emotions. If the address that we are to receive is sufficiently significant, the members' spontaneous response would be the better one.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>I am very pleased to be giving this second reading speech today. Since this bill was introduced, I have received support from a very broad cross&hyphen;section of the community for the measures it proposes. That support has been bipartisan and includes the Sydney Airport Community Forum, which met last week and passed a motion calling for support for this bill or similar legislation. I am pleased to report that the motion was carried with only one dissenting vote cast by the aviation industry representative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have also received letters and telephone calls of support from many residents not just in my electorate but throughout Sydney and a number of councils affected by Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport, including Botany, North Sydney, Leichhardt, Marrickville and South Sydney. There is very broad support for this measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today I received endorsement for this measure from none other than the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp). This is a perfect example of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6958"> minister playing the politics of catch&hyphen;up. He put out two press releases today. The first is headed `Sydney airport aircraft movements cap to be legislated', in which he said he would introduce government legislation to impose a cap of 80 aircraft movements per hour at Sydney airport. He said he would introduce his own legislation because `Mr Albanese's private member's bill has a number of technical flaws'. You would have expected the minister, with a whole department at his disposal, to have then gone on to outline those flaws. But he did not. Not one mention of a problem with this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did the minister then do? He put out another press release deleting that sentence. So now, in the minister's press release mark 2 headed `Legislation introduced for Sydney airport' we have the minister foreshadowing government legislation in opposition to mine but without stating one single reason why, given that my bill covers all necessary technical legislation. There are no details in either of his press releases and, most importantly, no timetable for the introduction of that legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite this, I can give a commitment on behalf of the opposition that we will support a government bill as long as it achieves the following objective: like my private member's bill, it is a tight bill and not just a watered down version of the legislation which I have put before this House today&mdash;no maybes, no broad discretions, but a tight bill. No exemptions for VIPs and air force jets going in and out, no exemptions for the Olympics or special sporting events, but tight legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government is fair dinkum and introduces legislation which I know and I acknowledge has the support of members on both sides of this chamber who represent electorates around Sydney airport, then we will in fact prove we are fair dinkum. We will not worry about who is moving the bill but prove that we are concerned with results.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this bill were passed into law, it would draw a line in the sand for those who wish Sydney airport to grow to unsustainable limits. The aviation industry and some elements of the tourism lobby who say there should be no limit to the size of KSA are not <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in touch with reality. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport is growing at a rate which far exceeds all previous expectations. Forecasts from the discredited draft EIS into the third runway predicted that movements would increase from 206,000 in 1988 to 340,000 in the year 2010&mdash;a growth rate of 2.3 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In reality this growth has been much higher. From 1985 to 1994, the actual average growth in aircraft movements was 5.59 per cent. The most recent figures are even more concerning. In the six-month period from November 1995 to April 1996 aircraft movements grew by 9.6 per cent compared with the previous year average. The Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics working paper entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Adequacy of transport infrastructure</EMPHASIS> shared this view. The bureau suggested that KSA's ultimate capacity of 353,000 movements per year could be reached as early as the year 2003. It is clear that Sydney airport does have a limit and that that limit is fast approaching.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite policies of sharing the noise, there is no doubt that thousands of residents in my electorate are still subjected to excessive aircraft noise. In fact, many hundreds of people in my electorate who sold their homes under the old flight path, at a massive loss, and moved to unaffected neighbouring areas are now being plagued with the noise that they paid dearly to escape. These people were presumably encouraged by the commitment of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that there will no new flights over the seat of Lowe, and many moved in that direction. John Howard was very clear about this commitment prior to the election. His press release dated 8 February 1996 stated that `there will be no new flight paths over Ashfield, Strathfield, Rhodes' et cetera and that `Lowe will not be affected in the future'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In light of the Prime Minister's unequivocal commitments, it was interesting to receive at last week's SACF meeting the maps of the 10 new modes of proposed operations for Sydney airport. There will be not one new flight path over Lowe but seven new flight paths over Lowe&mdash;four going out, three coming in. No wonder we are not prepared to take the press release of the Minister for Transport and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6959"> Regional Development at face value. We want to see the legislation introduced in this House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only problem with the SACF meeting was that no usage capacity figures were provided with the maps. In other words, members were told where the planes would go but not how often they would go there. We were told that the preferred mode was mode 4&mdash;over the waters of Botany Bay. I think Airservices Australia thought that would make us happy&mdash;`Trust us; we're honest!'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there is not a lot of faith in government or in governmental organisations regarding Sydney airport. When we were finally given the figures, we were told that this so-called preferred mode would operate only five to 10 per cent of the time. In fact, a conservative tally of the modes that would see movements over the north, east or west totalled 74 per cent. The modes that revert to the noisy parallel operations will be used 45 to 50 per cent of the time, and they deliver a capacity of over 87 movements per hour. Noise levels may have dropped in some areas, but they are destined to become significantly worse if nothing is done to restrain capacity and there is no second airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Time does not allow me to elaborate on the many other impacts that Sydney airport has on our area, including ground noise, air pollution and traffic congestion&mdash;not to mention the danger of a plane crash in Australia's most densely populated area. These all lead to the same conclusion: in human and economic terms, we cannot afford Sydney airport to grow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I stated in my first reading speech, the commitment of the coalition to this measure is clear. Page 8 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Putting people first&mdash;the coalition's policy on Sydney airport</EMPHASIS> of 29 January states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coalition will cap aircraft movements at 80 movements per hour. . . </PARA>
<PARA>That commitment is clear and cannot be denied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill cannot succeed without the construction of a second airport. I am totally committed, as is the opposition, to the construction of a second airport at Badgerys Creek. This is not a `nimby' attitude. I am <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tired of those who say this debate is about inner city people wanting to dump their problems somewhere else. I challenge these people to go to Sydenham or Tempe or Marrickville and find me houses full of yuppies. They simply do not exist. My seat has a higher percentage of families with incomes below $16,000 and a lower average family income than either Prospect or Greenway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Lindsay by-election there was a high-profile candidate called Kaye Vella, who ran a campaign against Badgerys Creek airport. Her campaign did not get off the ground. She could not garner any support, ran about seventh and could not get one per cent of the vote. It is clear that the longer we prevaricate on the actual construction of a second airport, the more desperate the situation will become. We need to build it, and we need to build it now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have outlined the reasons why this bill must be supported: a vote for this bill is a vote for a limit to noise at KSA; a vote for this bill is a vote for airline safety; a vote for this bill is a vote for better planning of our airport needs; a vote for this bill is a vote to ensure the government keeps its promises; a vote for this bill is a vote for certainty and security for the residents of Sydney. We await with anticipation the introduction of the government bill. We will not be withdrawing my legislation until such time as we have a chance to analyse that bill and to see how fair dinkum the minister is. Until that time, I urge all members to support my bill. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be very glad to elaborate on the technical and legal difficulties later in my speech. As a result, the government will reject the passage of this bill in its present form for these specific reasons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, it is nonetheless heartening to see the now opposition adopting coalition policy, however belatedly. It is, I believe, incumbent on me to point out to the House that the opposition's posturing on the issue of a cap is in stark contrast to their stance on the issue prior to the election, which was a policy of not having a policy on the cap at KSA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note how the ALP is gradually adopting all the coalition policies regarding aircraft movements at KSA&mdash;firstly, in regard to the curfew and, secondly, in regard to support for the coalition's rejection of the privatisation of KSA until the aircraft noise issues are adequately addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I pause at this moment to reflect on and remember how, prior to the 2 March election, the then Minister for Transport, the honourable member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith (Mr Brereton), who is now in the chamber, attacked the coalition for our stance on this issue. Now we see a total about&hyphen;face. In fact, I am sure that honourable members who have an interest in the issue of aircraft noise will remember the vehemence of the attack from the ALP towards the coalition for supposedly wrecking the airport sale process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now see another turnaround from the ALP in attempting to again copy coalition policy in regard to the cap on movements at KSA to not more than 80 movements per hour. However, the answer to the cap is not comprehensively and adequately addressed by a hurried and poorly drafted private member's bill from the honourable member for Grayndler, which comes after 13 years of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> scandalous mismanagement of KSA by the ALP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take up the challenge by the honourable member for Grayndler in regard to the specifics and the inadequacies of the bill. Whilst time is running out for me to mention the other matters I want to raise, I will go into some detail on the problems in his bill. Part 2, clause 4, relates to the limitation on the number of aircraft movements. No mention is made of who has the responsibility for ensuring that the limits are not breached&mdash;a very important and crucial omission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I notice that the honourable member for Grayndler has a copy of the bill in front of him. Part 3 of the bill relates to the provision of information. The policy intention behind that provision is singularly unclear. Further, does the minister table reports on airport operations only if the cap has been exceeded? What if the cap is not exceeded? Does he then have to lodge a report, no matter what happens? The bill is silent on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also concerned about aspects of the bill contained in part 4 relating to injunctions. I refer in particular to clauses 8 and 9 which will override the Federal Court's own rules on standing. Also of concern is subclause 9(2), which will do absolutely nothing to discourage vexatious litigants. We all know what a cost will be imposed on the government by people who will do everything they can to take the government to court by way of vexatious acts.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rush and haste to produce this private member's bill is further evidenced by a number of drafting errors. For instance, the reference to section 3 in subclause 5(1) should <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6961"> refer to section 4; the reference to section 7 in subclause 7(1) should refer to section 6; the reference to section 7 in subclause 9(1) should refer to section 8; and the reference to section 7 in subclause 9(2) should refer to section 8.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Conversely, I was pleased this morning to note that the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) has confirmed that the coalition will soon present a government bill, comprehensive and thoroughly researched, to cap aircraft movements at KSA to no more than 80 per hour.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have great pleasure in seconding the motion for the second reading of the Sydney Airport (Regulation of Movements) Bill. After hearing the contribution of the member for Lowe (Mr Zammit), one wonders why the government <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is not going to support it. He put forward nitpicking proposals about how this clause ought to be a subclause. As he should know, those things can easily be fixed up when we get to the consideration in detail stage of this bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the member for Lowe thinks everything should come in here as pristine as he is now suggesting, then he ought to have a talk to the Leader of the House (Mr Reith). If the member for Lowe recalls, when the government introduced the workplace relations bill recently it had to come back with some hundreds of amendments. Pages and pages of amendments were brought forward by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the only nitpicking opposition to this bill the government can come up with is that we should make these small amendments, then the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese) and I would be more than happy to accommodate any of those types of amendments that the member for Lowe or anyone else on the government side might want to move. But the problem is that the government does not really want this piece of legislation passed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Lowe talks about how this is coalition policy. The member for Lowe, who often has a short memory about these things&mdash;seeing that the government has rolled him on the issue of flight paths&mdash;might recall that when we went to the election it was the Labor Party's policy that we have 80 movements an hour. It was what we decided we were going to do. The member for Grayndler and I are not really interested in this nitpicking argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government is willing to bring in complementary legislation which does what we have proposed in the bill, we are more than happy to go along with it once we see it. But the trouble with this government is that, when they get down to the fine print of the bill that the minister brings in, there will be lots of let-outs. VIP aircraft will be let out so that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and his mates can fly into the airport at any time they like.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He says it is not his portfolio, and that is right, but he spends a lot of his time in them. We all know that. What the member for Grayndler and I are saying is that the people who live around Sydney airport have put up with the problems of noise there for long enough. What we want is for the number of movements there to be limited to 80 an hour. That is what the EIS on the airport was about, and we should enshrine that in legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has received advice&mdash;and we know about this&mdash;that the airport can operate at about 120 movements an hour. The people in the finance area of the government are very keen that this piece of legislation not be passed, because they know that if they can get this legislation knocked off they can go out on the quiet and say to the people who want to buy Sydney airport, `Wink, wink; nudge, nudge. The operational cap is 80 movements an hour, but if you buy the airport and give us a better price we will let you run it up to 120 movements an hour.' That is the go. The government knows that that is the go. Their people are putting around that story right now, so the proof of this is in the pudding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By putting this bill forward, we have caused the government to come to the party. If we had not put this bill forward, there is no way that the government was ever going to come in here suggesting that they would do anything. The member for Lowe, the member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) and the member for Cook (Mr Mutch) have all gone along to these community meetings and said, `We support this now.' They never  supported it until we put it forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had an effect on the government. What I would say to the government is: the member for Grayndler and I are more than happy to support some honest legislation from the government which will implement what this bill says. They can go on with all the nitpicking they like. We are happy; we will cop it. But the undertakings we want from the government&mdash;and I would like to hear from the future speakers on this bill now&mdash;relate to when the minister will be bringing in his bill, how quickly the government wants to pass it <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and when the people around Sydney airport will get some relief by the government getting off this stupid idea about building an airport at Holsworthy and getting on with the construction at Badgerys Creek.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those of us who live around the airport know that that is the only way to resolve the pressure on Sydney airport so that we will not have people trying to do away with the curfew and trying to exceed the number of movements per hour currently permitted. Results for our constituents are what we want. If the government is willing to accommodate that, we are willing to accommodate them, but we want to do it honestly. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have had the pleasure over the last seven days of chairing six public meetings around the Sydney basin in relation to aircraft noise. They were held at Willoughby, Marrickville, Randwick, Drummoyne, South Hurstville and Cronulla. There was one overwhelming message that came out of those public meetings; that is, that the community is very cynical about anything that the Labor Party is proposing in relation to aircraft noise. They are extremely cynical because it was the Labor Party that burnt the bridges between the community and the government on this issue. It was the Labor Party that razed a town called Good Faith. They razed that town by setting up the third runway, by trying to concentrate the noise over a limited number of people. The net result is that the community has had enough of the Labor Party and they are extremely cynical about every proposal coming out of the Labor Party in relation to aircraft noise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two significant things have occurred in relation to this matter since 2 March. I can understand the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese) trying to rebuild the credibility of the Labor Party on this issue. He has done that in two particular ways. It must have given him a great sense of satisfaction as a member of the Left to be able to initiate in caucus a proposal that the ALP dump privatisation at Kingsford Smith airport until such time as the noise problems were fixed. That sounds a lot to me like the policy that the Liberal Party took to the 2 March election.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6963">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was the Labor Party that wanted to sell the airport, it was the Labor Party that wanted to sell the airport straight away with no cap and it was the Labor Party that built the third runway that enabled the airport to get up to the so-called 120 movements an hour. It is the Liberal Party that has taken the right action here. We have set the cap on movements at Sydney airport: 80 movements an hour. Then the Labor Party said, `We'll go for 85.' They were not even out-bidding us. Yet they are now introducing legislation to provide for 80 movements an hour. We have no problem with that whatsoever. It is our policy. You are trying to come over to our side of the field.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, as I pointed out in relation to privatisation, it was the Labor Party that wanted to sell Kingsford Smith airport straight away to get it out of the way and get rid of the problem. We said that we would try to fix it. We have gone to the people and we have spoken with the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot remember the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith (Mr Brereton)&mdash;unfortunately he chose to step out of the chamber just before I spoke&mdash;chairing any public meetings. Yet I am going into his electorate to chair public meetings with his community which is expressing concerns about aircraft noise. I say to the member: I do not have to do your job; I encourage you to speak to your own constituents about the problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have pointed out that there are some technical flaws in this bill and we are doing exactly the same thing as the Labor Party did when they were in government. We are saying that as a government we think we can have a better bill. As my colleague the member for Lowe (Mr Zammit) pointed out, the technical problems are identified in parts 2, 3 and 4&mdash;that is, clause 4 of part 2&mdash;schedule 1 in relation to the amendment to section 210 of the Airports Act 1996. Even drafting errors are in place in relation to subclauses 5(1), 7(1), 9(1) and 9(2).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As was pointed out by the member for Grayndler and a number of other speakers, the Sydney Airport Community Forum which I chair passed a resolution supporting the concept of putting into place legislation which would turn the cap into law. Bad legislation <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in my view leads to bad law. At this stage, this is bad legislation. We have seen enough of the ALP's rhetoric about what they want to do at Kingsford Smith airport; they have had enough of a chance to screw up the airport. Leave it to the government; it is doing a good job. We are getting there. We are rebuilding the bridges that you burnt and we are rebuilding the town of Good Faith in relation to aircraft noise in Sydney.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I point out to the House that a number of the drafting errors referred to by the member for Lowe (Mr Zammit) and the member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) appeared in an earlier draft. It is quite evident that they have not studied the final text that has been prepared. I will address some of the issues raised by the member for Lowe. He said that part 3 of the document was unclear on policy. No act that I have ever read, aside from the objects clause, ever states policy. The policy is set out in the explanatory memorandum and the second reading speech. He said it was silent as to whether a report was required if a cap was not exceeded. The simple answer to that is: who cares? If the report is required it is obviously required for a prosecution. Clearly no prosecution is contemplated if the cap is not exceeded.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other complaints were in respect of part 4, clauses 8 and 9, saying that it overrode Federal Court right of intervention provisions. He is saying that he wants to make it too tough for residents who have been affected to get involved in the court proceedings and have their say. The next point was criticism of the removal of potential cost penalties against litigants. That protection would have facilitated ordinary people who are affected by aircraft noise having their say in court. As I say, the fact of the matter is that, fundamentally, an earlier draft has been referred to in terms of several drafting errors which occurred in the earlier draft but which have been remedied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6964"> The fact is that 1997 is too far away. It seems quite ridiculous that legislation is proposed only after two separate working groups give a report to the government. What happens if the working groups give contradic tory reports? Who knows? Presumably there will have to be a third report. Time is of the essence. The member for North Sydney, with respect, said that Labor's policy on opposing the privatisation of Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport was akin to the Liberal&hyphen;National coalition policy last year when they opposed the privatisation. I strongly disagree with that; it is not so. The Liberal&hyphen;National opposition to the privatisation of Kingsford Smith airport last year prevented Badgerys Creek going ahead. If that had been privatised&mdash;the provisions were there for funding of Badgerys Creek and $156 million has already been spent&mdash;we would have Badgerys Creek up and running by the Olympics. Instead, we are looking right down the track, well and truly into the next century, possibly beyond the first decade of the next century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 2 October a senior adviser to the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop) wrote to a resident who would be affected by Holsworthy and said that it would not be necessary to relocate a hospital constructed at Holsworthy for about 10 years until Holsworthy was up and running&mdash;if the government went ahead with Holsworthy. We all know that Holsworthy has problems. It is a farce. Badgerys Creek was a done deal&mdash;$156 million had been spent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The money allocated in the forward estimates in last year's budget has been removed by this government. They have spent it on a fundamentally flawed EIS for Holsworthy, which is just putting this back and delaying it longer. That is what this government is about: delay is to the benefit of the big airline companies and the Federal Airports Corporation. The government is backing that delay at a cost to the residents that we all represent. I would have thought members opposite would have backed this bill to get it up and running now, to put the cap in place to end some of the suffering that all our constituents are affected by.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support in principle the Sydney Airport (Regulation of Movements) Bill 1996. The bill seeks to limit the number of aircraft movements at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. I support the principle of the bill because it attempts to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> enshrine coalition policy announced at the last election after careful consideration by then aviation spokesman Senator Warwick Parer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our precise commitment was that `the coalition will cap movements at 80 movements per hour by implementing a slot system'. This commitment is already being honoured. The development of the slot system is already well advanced and, in his directions to Airservices Australia in the setting up of the task force to look at the long&hyphen;term operations of KSA, the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) stipulated the non&hyphen;negotiable basis of the cap.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note that a group of ALP senators proposed a less stringent cap of 85 movements in the report of the Senate Select Committee on Aircraft Noise in Sydney entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Falling on deaf ears</EMPHASIS>. What a pertinent metaphor for 13 years of Labor government&mdash;falling on deaf ears. It is pleasing to see that the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese) seeks to identify himself with our policy and dissociate himself from the ALP, which has no credibility whatsoever on the aircraft noise issue. The honourable member endorses our policy. His bill is a political stunt&mdash;a good stunt, but a stunt nevertheless.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was one of three federal Liberal members who supported a motion moved last week at the Sydney Airport Community Forum which says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Sydney Airport Community Forum supports the "<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Airport (Regulation of Movements) Bill 1996</EMPHASIS> " in principle, or similar legislation which would enshrine a restricted capacity of up to 80 movements in any one hour at KSA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe a second Sydney Airport would enable this capacity to be reduced in the future.</PARA>
<PARA>That motion was moved by the honourable member for Grayndler and seconded by the honourable member for Lowe (Mr Zammit).<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I emphasise the last paragraph because it is at the heart of this issue. With a growth rate at KSA of four to five per cent it is obvious that we need a second airport to service Sydney. If it were not for the prevarication of the previous government we would be well on the way to having a second airport to service Sydney. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6965">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now, of course, the scene has changed and the choice of a second airport is fraught with difficulties. If we do not have a second airport, pressure will continue to increase on KSA and madcap schemes such as the proposal to build a fourth runway in the middle of Botany Bay will gain more credence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">God forbid that the ALP should ever be re&hyphen;elected. The Freddy Krueger of Australian politics, although dead, is still kicking. The nightmare to contemplate is the honourable member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith (Mr Brereton) officiating one day at the opening of the fourth runway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although it is a long&hyphen;term aim, when the second airport is operational it is my view that all curfew operations from KSA should be transferred and the number of non&hyphen;curfew operations reduced to a more tolerable level. Because this bill is a political stunt it has not been properly thought out.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been given a brief by the minister of all the technical difficulties apparent in the present bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the responsibility of the government to ensure that our policy is implemented effectively and the minister has been doing this in a responsible manner. I support the principle of the bill. I will vote to support the legislation to be introduced by the minister at the appropriate time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It must be said that the ALP has no credibility whatsoever on this issue. That should be evidenced by the fact that the long&hyphen;suffering people of Kurnell gave me a 20 per cent swing to win the booth. That is historic support from those people. I have been offering them truth and honesty. They are not 100 per cent pleased by what has been proposed so far, and neither am I&mdash;but neither is anybody. At least they are getting truth and honesty from this government&mdash;something they did not get from the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ALP have put up two cleanskins to speak to this bill. I might term the honourable member for Barton (Mr McClelland) a cleanskin, but I do not know what I would term the honourable member for Grayndler.

The problem he has got is that he cannot get his way against the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> massive Right in the New South Wales Labor Party. They have buried him under concrete before and they will bury him under concrete and asphalt again. He has got very little say within the Labor Party.

<PARA>War evokes many stories of horror and sacrifice and among its great tragedies are the experiences of the prisoners taken in war. Never in history have so many Australians been held captive by our enemies than in southern Asia in 1942. An estimated 13,000 Australian prisoners of war, along with 30,000 British, 18,000 Dutch and 700 Americans, were put to work by their Japanese captors to build the infamous Thai&hyphen;Burma railway. Many of the Australians were surrendered at the fall of Singapore. Some had never fired a shot in battle but were destined to spend the war as slave labour for the enemy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Japanese were concerned that their communications depended upon long and exposed sea routes and so decided to complete a railway connecting Burma with Thailand and Singapore. Work on a railway had commenced prior to the war but was abandoned, leaving the most difficult 403 kilometres still to build. The route was through mountainous jungle country, home of almost every known tropical disease and with one of the most inhospitable climates in the world.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The men worked in appalling conditions, food supplies were irregular and inadequate, and they were sent to work on the line before any accommodation was completed. Disease, malaria, dysentery and cholera were rife and medical supplies severely limited. The Japanese masters were cruel and when the work was delayed by the wettest monsoon in history they demanded even more from their prisoners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps the most remarkable and tragic story of the line was the construction of Hellfire Pass. Ironically, construction of Hellfire Pass commenced with a work force of 400 Australian prisoners on Anzac Day 1943. The required excavation of soil and rock to a depth of 20 metres soon fell behind schedule and additional Australian and British prisoners brought the work force to 1,000 men. A vast amount of material had to be removed from the cutting by hand using cane baskets and sacks slung between poles. The men worked around the clock, using oil pot lamps, and such was the brutality of the Japanese and Korean engineers and guards that 69 men were beaten to death. An estimated 400 prisoners of war lost their lives building Hellfire Pass. It is appropriate, therefore, that this area, Konyu Cutting at Hellfire Pass, should be chosen as the site for a memorial for prisoners of war.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After the war, the railway line was torn up and the line was quickly reclaimed by the jungle. In 1983, a former prisoner of war, Tom Morris, returned to Hellfire Pass and resolved to convince the Australian government that the area should be preserved and presented as an historic site. Jim Appleby, an engineer with the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation who was working on a dam on the Upper Kwai, used much of his spare time to investigate accessible parts of the old abandoned railway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australia&hyphen;Thai Chamber of Commerce started to take an interest in the proposal. Tim Fischer spoke about the project in this House on 27 February 1987. Former foreign minister Bill Hayden was among visitors to Hellfire Pass. When former Prime Minister Keating visited the site in 1994 he provided encouragement for the Australian government's <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6967"> eventual commitment to a memorial and museum. Plans are close to completion for the construction of a $1.6 million building.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Working enthusiastically has been Mr Rod Beattie, a former constituent of mine, who works with the Commonwealth War Graves Commission at Kanchanaburi. Rod has shown extraordinary enthusiasm and dedication and has personally reclaimed and cleared a four&hyphen;kilometre walking track along the old railway route. The lines and bridges have long since gone, but the ballast, each stone broken by the hammers of prisoners of war, is still in place, along with occasional decaying sleepers. Staircases have been built into the ravines once crossed by trestle bridges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In September, I visited the Hellfire Pass project. I walked with Rod Beattie along the line in the steamy jungle, paused at Hintock Station, walked where the pack of cards bridge stood and on to Compressor Cutting and finally to Hellfire Pass. I saw the magnificently stone pitched embankments, the narrow twisting cuttings and the remnants of the old bridges. It is impossible not to be deeply moved just by being there. This place saw so much suffering, so much inhumanity and so many losses. In Hellfire Pass there is a major plaque remembering those who died and another recognising the work of Sir Edward `Weary' Dunlop, whose ashes were interred in the pass on Anzac Day 1994, exactly 51 years after construction began.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To visit the Thai&hyphen;Burma railway meant a great deal to me. My wife's father was one of the prisoners of war. Warrant Officer Arch Caswell was a radar technician and received a British Empire Medal for his work in building radios in the POW camps. Constructed from an array of pilfered parts and hidden in the leg of a stool, the radio kept prisoners informed of the progress of the war. As the war drew to an end and the presence of the radio became too dangerous, it was buried beneath the kitchen at his final camp at Tamarkan&mdash;and who knows, it still may be there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the 13,000 Australians who worked on the Burma&hyphen;Thai railway were famous like Weary Dunlop, one of whose wartime hospitals stood under two large trees <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which now shade the Chungkai Cemetery where 1,740 of his colleagues are buried. Most were unknown. Frank Huxham, who on the day he died was referred to in my father&hyphen;in&hyphen;law's diary as `our special mate', now rests among 6,982 other prisoners of war in the beautifully tended graves at the Kanchanaburi war cemetery. Cyril Scriven, who only a couple of months ago when he learned he had just a few more weeks to live, returned to Thailand for one last visit to the railway and to bid farewell to his mates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One in five of the prisoners of war who worked on the railway perished, including 2,710 Australians. The death toll among the conscripted 200,000 Asian labourers was even worse. At least 80,000 were thought to have perished. Some 1,000 Japanese also died. In all, one life was lost for every five metres of track. Even most of those who returned were irrevocably changed. Is it any wonder that this project, though engineeringly significant, was named the Death Railway?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Hellfire Pass memorial project will help record some of the history and memorabilia of that era. In addition to the memorial, museum and walking track, Rod Beattie hopes to rebuild part of one of the bridges and bring back one of the original wartime engines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the Australian government, to its credit, has taken the lead on this project, and the Thai government have been active partners, this is not intended to be a memorial only for Australians. There were more British and Dutch POWs working and lost on the railway than there were Australians. I encourage the British, Dutch, American, Malaysian and other governments, along with POW associations and other ex-service groups, to support the project and to bring it to fruition. The Australia&hyphen;Thai Chamber of Commerce has played a major role, and I hope that Australian and other overseas companies working in Thailand will also lend the project their active support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have noted the tremendous support for this project by the current Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott), and I welcome his presence at the table. I have suggested to him that perhaps there needs to be some kind of trust established to assist in the management <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6968"> of the memorial and to receive donations. Overseas war museums and families of ex&hyphen;POWs can assist with much of the research which needs to be done to present the Hellfire Pass project as a living centre of study.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No memorial, no matter how impressive, can ever adequately depict the horror of those times and that place. The best memorial is in the hearts of Australians who remember. But if we are to adequately value our peace, we need to always remember the sufferings of war. This project provides a tangible recognition and will surely entrench in our hearts that such a thing must never happen again.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. It is with pleasure that I come to this place today to second the motion moved by our colleague the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) and, in doing so, to demonstrate once again that on specific matters in this place there is a tremendous amount of bipartisanship, particularly when it comes to matters that affect our service personnel and people from the veterans community generally. Like the honourable member for Wide Bay, I am appreciative of the fact that the current Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) is in the chamber this afternoon to hear the comments made by his colleague from the National Party and to hear the comments from the opposition, which are totally in support of the motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that the four parts of the motion which has been moved go to some very real elements of this matter. The first part of the motion acknowledges the heroism and sacrifice of Australia's prisoners of war, in particular those who worked on the Burma&hyphen;Thailand railway. I refer members to the 1995-96 annual report of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. There is a section in that report, at page 69, which talks about the Hellfire Pass memorial project. I will quote some excerpts from that part of the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Burma&hyphen;Thailand Railway from Moulamein in Burma to Ban Pong in Thailand was built by the Japanese during World War II to resupply their army in Burma. Construction began in June 1942 and was completed in December 1943. The railway <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> was built using prisoners of war and impressed Asian labourers. Of the 60 000 Allied prisoners employed during construction, some 12 000 including more than 2 700 Australians, died of disease, sickness, ill treatment, malnutrition and exhaustion. It is estimated that between 80 000 and 100 000 Asian labourers died. Conditions for the prisoners and labourers were deplorable and the treatment they received from their Japanese and Korean guards was barbaric.</PARA>
<PARA>As the honourable member for Wide Bay has pointed out, Hellfire Pass was the name given to Konyu Cutting because, during a campaign in 1943 to speed completion of the railway, open fires were used to light the scene for the night shift. This cutting was selected as a memorial site in 1984 and the memorial was dedicated on 26 April 1987. Site works in 1988 were the main bicentennial project of the Australian&hyphen;Thai Chamber of Commerce and were funded by the Australian government to the tune of some $31,000. Since then further works and the relaying of a single section of rail in the cutting have been carried out by Australian Defence Force units on temporary duty in Thailand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second part of the motion commends the government on its initiative to construct a museum and memorial to prisoners of war near Hellfire Pass in Thailand. Again, I think that is appropriate. I think it is also appropriate that the former government be similarly commended, because it was during the tenure of our former colleague who is regrettably departed, Con Sciacca, and during a visit by the former Prime Minister, Paul Keating, that in fact this war memorial concept was put in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to turn back to comments which the former Prime Minister Paul Keating made at an address in a POW ceremony at the Australian War Memorial. He talks not only about the concept of Hellfire Pass and commitments that were made by the government at the time to that memorial which we are discussing today but also generally about what prisoners of war had to endure. The speech which he delivered on 14 February 1995 contained some very interesting statistics. In all, as I have said, more than 27,000 Australians died in the Second World War. Their sacrifice, like that of those who have <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6969"> died in every war, will never be forgotten. In Thailand last year at Kanchanaburi, the Prime Minister attended a service for the Australians who died as prisoners of war on the Burma&hyphen;Thailand railway. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Their story is legendary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thirty thousand Australians were POWs in various parts of the world. It is they who we are honouring today: the Australians who died in captivity.</PARA>
<PARA>It is interesting to take from the then Prime Minister's speech a couple of further points:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To remember the sacrifice of our POWs today, we need to imagine not just the physical suffering they endured, but the psychological suffering&mdash;the terrible loneliness and the sense of loss, the homesickness and the helplessness they had to live with.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And we need to ask ourselves what gave them the faith and courage they needed to live with the adversity and fight off the despair?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How did they keep hope alive?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We know from accounts like those of Barney Roberts and Weary Dunlop . . . that paramount among the sustaining values of Australian POWs were those indefinable bonds between them which we call mateship.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>That is absolutely true. It is something which we as serving members of parliament should under all circumstances remember. As a duty, we should pass on our knowledge and our information about the suffering that men and women who fought for Australia in fact endured, and those at Hellfire Pass are a classic example of the sort of teaching we should be giving to people. As Paul Keating in that speech again remarked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The outrage we feel about what was done on the Burma&hyphen;Thailand Railway or on the Sandakan Death March should never fade.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our children should know about these things.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We must not forget.</PARA>
<PARA>And that is dead right. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yet, as the life of Weary Dunlop tells us, we must allow the wounds to heal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If Australians sacrificed their lives and freedom so that we could be free, we owe it both to their memory and our children to see that Australia is kept free of old hatreds and bitterness.</PARA>
<PARA>That speech, delivered by former Prime Minister Keating on 14 February 1995 at the POW ceremony at the Australian War Memorial, encapsulates in my view the very concerns and the very thrust of the motion <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which the honourable member for Wide Bay brings before us today. Like him, I would congratulate and commend Mr Beattie and his associates for their work in clearing a four&hyphen;kilometre walking trail along the Burma&hyphen;Thailand railway at Hellfire Pass. Similarly, I would call on Australian companies, ex&hyphen;service organisations and other countries whose service personnel also worked on the railway to support the prisoner of war memorial project because that project itself is commendable indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the member for Wide Bay pointed out, following a visit by the then Prime Minister in February 1994 and an exchange of correspondence between the Australian and Thai governments in August 1994, the Commonwealth government committed $1.6 million to the development of a museum complex centred on Hellfire Pass which will comprise a museum, a 4.5&hyphen;kilometre walkway with rest stations and information panels along the alignment of the railway and a locomotive and rolling stock exhibit. The first stage of the project was completed with the commissioning of the walking trail on Anzac Day this year and the project is expected to be completed by September 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As has been reported, this memorial does provide an awareness for people who visit Hellfire Pass of the sacrifice that was made by Australians and, equally, by representatives and members of serving personnel of other countries who, like the Australians, were captured, were prisoners of war and had to endure the sorts of conditions that some of us could only dream about in terms of their severity, in terms of the way in which humankind can subject other members of humankind to such things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australia Remembers program last year did a number of things. It brought a dimension to public education, an awareness, about the sacrifices and the way in which Australian men and women have given for this country that we should not forget. It should not simply be a one year's remembrance activity; it should be something which is ongoing. It is through motions such as this which the honourable member for Wide Bay has brought before this House for discussion that the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6970"> awareness and public education program continues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to commend him for bringing it to the House today. My only regret is that we did not have more time because I think there were many members of this place on both sides of the chamber who would have liked to have commented on it. I am sure even the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, who has been with us during this debate, would like to have made some comments about his views on this matter, which are very similar to those of all of us. Let me conclude by again congratulating the member for Wide Bay for bringing forward this motion.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought I would start today's grievance debate on a positive note and say how pleased I was to attend the second anniversary of the Filipino&hyphen;Australian Development Association. They are a group in my electorate who undertake a very worthwhile cause of raising money. It was their second anniversary dinner at the Granville Bowling Club, in the electorate of the honourable member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson), that I attended. This year they are donating to the Life Education Centre in Colyton in my electorate, and the Mary MacKillop Foundation. They are also providing some money to needy students in the Philippines.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a very well&hyphen;attended function. I must offer my sincere congratulations to the president, George Flowers, and the vice-president, Cynthia Macabenta, who really worked very <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> hard to make the night an outstanding success. I am very pleased that the Blacktown City Council was a diamond donor for the function. As I pointed out, this is a reflection of the esteem in which the Filipino community are held in Blacktown as well as a recognition of the significant contribution they are making to the city.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also attended a couple of senior citizens meetings, in particular a meeting of the Combined Pensioners Association at Rooty Hill. When you attend these functions you really do not act in a very political way at all. But, in being pleased to attend their luncheon, I must say I was, if you like, a little political. I pointed out that, whilst the pension had not been reduced, everything else for senior citizens had been attacked by the Liberal government following the 2 March election. I was very disappointed that this was so because I believe you judge a society by the way a society cares for its children and its elderly people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I pointed out, for example, that the co&hyphen;payment for prescriptions had been increased without increasing the pension. The dental health program&mdash;600,000 of our fellow Australians being assisted this year&mdash;will be abolished next year. Legal aid has been heavily restricted and curtailed. Pensioners benefit from legal aid and will now severely restricted. In relation to public housing, there will be no new pensioner flats constructed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have spoken before in the House about the issue of the up&hyphen;front payment for nursing homes. Indeed, I was asked by one of the pensioners whether, if you are already in a hostel, you would still be up for the up&hyphen;front payment if you needed to go into a nursing home. Sadly, I said yes. I quoted the figure of the Our Lady of Consolation Home, a large and particularly well&hyphen;run operation by the Good Sisters at Rooty Hill. They estimate that 90 per cent of people who are resident in nursing homes would be financially disadvantaged. All these things that go to assist pensioners in the twilight years of their lives have been attacked or abolished by the incoming government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also went to a function put on by the Rooty Hill Rotary Club. They invited over <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6971"> 300 pensioners to the Good Shepherd. I was very pleased to see Father Pat and Damien Colbourne there in the thick of things. I congratulate Rotary for the excellent luncheon that they put on. My only regret was that I had to leave before lunch was served, and I rather think that there was a better lunch there than at the function that I ended up going to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last issue that I want to raise in this grievance debate concerns Badgerys Creek airport. I know that the House has heard a lot about Kingsford Smith airport. I am one of those members who have been really concerned&mdash;and a lot of my constituents have been as well&mdash;about the adverse impact that a lot of residents in and around Mascot airport have been suffering because of changes made by the former and the present governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to Badgerys Creek itself, I think the overwhelming support really started to change&mdash;or the first discernible signs of change&mdash;with the opening of the third runway and the impact that that had on inner city residents. I have already confessed that I was a very early supporter of the Badgerys Creek airport. As with lots of things, you can look back in hindsight and say, `Well, if it had been built as it was originally proposed'&mdash;not as a general airport but as a fully&hyphen;fledged international airport&mdash;`back in the mid&hyphen; to late&hyphen;1980s, then a lot of the debate that we are having these days about Sydney's second airport would not exist.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to also report to the House that, in a small way at the moment but increasingly, concerns are being expressed about Badgerys Creek. I happen to believe that it was a real disappointment that the agreement did not go ahead that we had with the then Minister for Transport. It had been agreed that the three additional studies to supplement the 1980s EIS would go ahead, that the flight paths would be developed and that there would be a full consultation process with everyone in the western suburbs of Sydney so they would know before the last election precisely whether or not they were affected and, if so, how. I have some sympathy with Senator John Faulkner who, towards the end of our term of government, scrambled&mdash;valiantly, I think&mdash;with a further EIS.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The John Howard government did make some undertakings about Badgerys Creek. They said that there would be a much better, full, public, accountable and transparent EIS process. I do not really believe that anything that has been published to date suggests that that really is the case. There is not one indication in anything that has been published to date about the degree and manner of the consultation. Whilst I accept that the EIS is considering whether there will be a curfew, I do not believe a 24&hyphen;hour operation for a new airport is any more acceptable, particularly if the basis of the EIS shows a differential in the treatment of night flights between Australian practice and world best practice. That is certainly the case and has been commented on by a Senate report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing that I remain disappointed about with the government is that, prior to the election, there was talk of a go/no&hyphen;go clause in the EIS, that is, when all the factors were added up&mdash;whether it was air quality or noise or whatever aspect the EIS was examining&mdash;there would have to be a recommendation by the officials that on balance the airport should proceed or that on balance it should not. Certainly, there is no provision in the current federal environmental act, but it is a feature of the relevant New South Wales act. I feel that a lot of my constituents are going to be disappointed that this is not a feature in this EIS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps the two most alarming things now about the EIS are the provision of a cross&hyphen;runway that heads straight for my electorate and that of the honourable member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly) as well as an option C which turns the runway from the original around 90 degrees and heads straight over St Clair and Erskine Park. One can only wonder whether the people who voted Liberal in St Clair are now being punished for having done so. Clearly, this will change a lot of people's attitude towards Badgerys Creek. I can only say that I think all people are going to be benefited by full consultation, a full amount of information being made available and everyone being able to assess for themselves what the impact of this airport will be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last but not least, I note that Blacktown City Council has now come out opposed to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6972"> Badgerys Creek airport. I just pose the question: I wonder what the Liberal controlled Penrith City Council are going to do and whether WESROC will take another opportunity to revisit the issue of Badgerys Creek airport.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am loath to mention the H word&mdash;as in Hanson&mdash;because it has already been done to death in the media. However, so many people in my electorate have asked for my opinion and, given that the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) has come in for some unnecessary criticism by members of both sides of this House, I thought I might just as well give my tuppence worth. Having spent 23 years in the media, I have a rough idea of how the media operates: a story is a story. Very often they do not let the truth get in the way of a good story.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Oxley has been built up, just as surely as attempts are now being made to cut her down. Before anyone judges this woman, I would suggest that they read her maiden speech, then re-read it and decide for themselves. Sure enough, she spoke of Aboriginal funding and multiculturalism, which we have all heard about. But she also spoke about issues which affect the lives of a great many Australians, notably the Family Law Act and the Child Support Agency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Oxley has four children, is a single parent and runs a fish and chip shop. The shop has made her the butt of many jokes, particularly from some members opposite. Why, I ask? Surely we should be encouraging someone who has set up a small business, as small business is still the greatest employer in Australia. Some members opposite are snide about the member for Oxley being a fish and chips lady, but how many members opposite have ever run a small business?  Only one of them has been involved in small business; so if they are going to sledge the member for Oxley for being a small business person they are more stupid than I imagined. Small business is our <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> nation's backbone and ought to be encouraged, not condemned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Oxley asked why we should have separate development for Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians. For example, we have Austudy and Abstudy, we have legal aid, and then there is the Aboriginal Legal Service. The Afrikaans word for separate development is `apartheid'. Isn't apartheid something that Australia lectured South Africa for years over?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Basically, she was talking about the dissemination of taxpayers' money. I think it is high time we got back to basics and ensured that there is adequate funding for health, education and community safety before anything else. It is ridiculous that we have waiting lists growing while we provide funding to trade unions, for example. That is what happened under Labor. Let us start to fix these problems first before we spend money elsewhere. I am all for spending money on health&mdash;getting rid of waiting lists&mdash;education and the essentials before giving money to trade unions, arts groups or the like.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Oxley said the Family Law Act had:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . brought death, misery and heartache to countless thousands of Australians, with children treated like pawns in some crazy game of chess.</PARA>
<PARA>I see the evidence of this every day in my job as a member of parliament. Equally, every day I see a parade of broken men and women who are victims of the Child Support Agency. Many non-custodial parents, as the member for Oxley pointed out, simply give up their job to escape the often impossible financial demands placed on them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not recall being asked what my view was, and here I totally agree with the member for Oxley. We are, I should remind the House, representatives of the people. We are here to act and speak on their behalf. How many of us really do ask the people what they want? It is their country, yet the only say that they have is every three years by placing a few numbers in a few boxes. How many times have Australians been  asked what migration levels they want? They do not, in reality, have a proper say. Just because one questions the rate of immigration does not <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6973"> make one a racist, and that is an unfair tag that I believe has been placed on the member for Oxley. I suggest to honourable members, as an exercise, to check out for themselves how difficult it is&mdash;if not impossible&mdash;to migrate to some of the countries who are loudly criticising our policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Oxley has also been criticised for her comments on foreign aid. Having recently led a delegation to our Pacific neighbours, I recognise the need for targeted aid, but let us not just throw dollars into a bottomless pit. Given that, how can we shout down the member for Oxley's view?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can only ask from the bottom of my heart: listen to this lady's view in the same way that you would listen to any fellow Australian's view. After the member for Oxley made her maiden speech in the federal parliament, I made a point of walking around the chamber to tell her that, while I might not agree with everything she said, I would defend to the death her right to say it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party have used the comments of the member for Oxley to condemn the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) for not responding to what she said. This is the same Labor Party who have as a candidate in the forthcoming Western Australian election a man whose actions in parliament led to the subject of those actions committing suicide. The member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) knows who I am talking about&mdash;it is John Halden. She did nothing about him. Kim Beazley did nothing about him. Geoff Gallop has done nothing about him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor did absolutely nothing about John Halden, who got up in parliament and tabled a petition, the contents of which were totally inaccurate and, as a result, an innocent young woman took her life. Labor did nothing, not even apologise. Yet they have the hide to have a go at the Prime Minister for not responding to a backbench MP who is not even of his own party and who simply spoke her mind. She exercised her right to free speech.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John Halden deliberately and dishonestly took actions which resulted in an innocent woman taking her life. The Labor Party did nothing about John Halden but are crying <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> blue murder for the Prime Minister doing nothing, quite rightly, about a member of the House of Representatives representing her electorate as she sees fit. Until the Labor Party get rid of John Halden, they have no right to lecture anyone&mdash;and the Prime Minister in particular&mdash;about taking action against members for actions they have taken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As all members would be aware, Western Australia goes to the polls on 14 December. Geoff Gallop released Labor's first policy recently, on financial management. His policy is to produce surpluses every year, reduce public sector debt and restore the state's credit rating to triple A. Dr Gallop is a policy thief. This is Liberal policy; it has been for four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor created the debt; Labor lost the triple A rating. It is the Liberal Party that has brought financial responsibility to Western Australia by paying the debt off and taking us back onto the road to triple A. What Dr Gallop is advocating is a vote for Liberal policies. When the first policy the Labor Party releases is the Liberal policy for the previous four years, you know that Labor have no ideas of their own.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today, the Western Australian Treasury, for the first time in the history of politics in Australia, will release a full statement of Western Australia's financial position. It will show forward estimates showing revenue and expenditure for four years. Members will recall that the federal Labor Party refused to detail the state of the nation's finances during the last election. It was not until we took office that the truth was revealed, that we were $8 billion worse off than the Labor government said we were. Today, the Western Australian Liberal government is honestly detailing the state of the books before the election. The federal government will be doing the same prior to the next election. That is the difference between the Labor Party and the Liberal Party: we will be responsible for taxpayers' money whereas Labor throws it away like confetti.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The wise people of Western Australia will reject Geoff Gallop on 14 December. He is a financial fraud. He was in the Labor Party room when millions were wasted on their big <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6974"> business mates. He did absolutely nothing about it. He did nothing when Labor sent our state into record indebtedness. He did nothing when Labor lost our triple A credit rating. He will only ruin the responsible financial management of the Court government, which has cut debt, thereby reducing debt servicing and allowing more money to be spent on the priorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Western Australia is to enter the next century in a sound financial position, able to spend money on the priorities of health, education and law and order, it needs a financially responsible government. Only one party offers that: the Liberal&hyphen;National coalition led by Richard Court.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I start on the comments which I came into the House to speak to this afternoon, I would like to respond to a few remarks made by the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Eoin Cameron), who preceded me. We in the Labor Party always find it a badge of courage when Liberal Party people feel it necessary to come into the House and attack Labor leaders of whatever state. I make the point to the honourable member that Geoff Gallop, whom the member has been attacking personally this afternoon, is a leader of the highest quality. Certainly, in my dealings with him as the former shadow minister for health in Western Australia, he is a person who has worked very hard to try to raise the issues that affect the quality of health care in that state.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Geoff Gallop, now the leader of the Labor Party in Western Australia and former spokesman on health and deputy leader, is one of those people who have put a lot of effort into trying to expose the Court government's cutbacks for public hospitals in Western Australia. It has been quite interesting to watch. When you look at how much state governments are spending on health around the country, it can be seen that New South <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Wales is the only state where they have actually increased the state effort for funding for public hospitals over the last two years. It is up by $600 million. There certainly has not been a $600 million increase in the Court government's funding for public hospitals in that state. In fact, they have cut state funding for public hospitals in Western Australia. When you add to that the Howard government's cutbacks in federal funding for public hospitals, it results in a second level of cuts for public hospital services in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> On the occasions that I have been to Western Australia, people whose working lives are dedicated to providing quality health care to Western Australians tell me that they have enormous difficulty in trying to provide the most basic health services to people in that state, given the cutbacks that have been made. It is common knowledge that a casualty ward in one of the major hospitals in Western Australia is known as the `Richard Court Wing' because of the number of people who have to wait on trolleys before they get admitted and get proper treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am quite sure that Geoff Gallop is prepared to be judged by the stand he has made in trying to encourage greater spending by the Court Liberal government on public hospital funding. We totally oppose the decision of that government to privatise some of the public hospitals in that state. We have enormous concerns about the impact these cutbacks are having on ordinary Western Australians, such as the increase in waiting times and reductions in the number of staff at these hospitals. It is these sorts of issues that Geoff Gallop will take to the electors of Western Australia over the next few weeks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I would like to make a few remarks about a very important event that took place last Friday on the central coast of New South Wales. The central coast is represented in this parliament by the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Lloyd), by me and by my colleague the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris), who covers the northern portion of the central coast. The Central Coast Suicide Committee, headed by Mr Eric Trezise, organised our region's first <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6975"> suicide summit last Friday. I acknowledge the fact that the member for Robertson attended and spoke on behalf of the Minister for Family Services, Judi Moylan, at that suicide summit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is of great concern to everyone who lives on the central coast that, over the last 43 weeks, 43 people have taken their lives&mdash;37 men and six women. In many cases, they were young men. It is an enormous loss to local communities and, in particular, a tragedy for the individual families and friends who know the people who have taken their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Many speakers at the summit spoke about the tendency amongst people who decide to take their lives to have difficulty with alcohol abuse, difficulty with the pressures caused by family breakdowns and difficulties caused by the isolation of living on the central cost with often inadequate public transport and high levels of unemployment in our local area. Stewart Heyward, a local parent, outlined in tragic detail the situation that his family faced before his son committed suicide. In particular, he outlined the difficulties that his family faced in trying to obtain adequate support from private and public hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He also went on to make some observations about his distress about some of the material that is around for young people these days, whether it is words that are used in certain songs played regularly on the radio or that are available on CDs, images that are available on certain videos or some of the unhealthy obsessions with rock stars who have taken their own lives in days gone by.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I certainly commend Mr Heyward for his bravery in sharing that tragic story with everyone who was at the suicide summit. It was quite surprising that 300 people attended this summit on the central coast. We can only hope that all those 300 people will take back what they have learnt from the summit and will try to make sure that we are able to provide better services for people who are in need of counselling. We can only hope that the local area hospital service will get extra funding to try to make sure that they can provide better counselling services and that we can help educate doctors, educators and people who work in schools to make them <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> better able to try to identify the people who are at risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mention in passing that, of the 43 people who have committed suicide on the central coast in the past 43 weeks, the overwhelming majority were men and many were young men. There are a number of areas of health care in Australia where men have greater difficulties than women. This often surprises many people and I know the parliamentary secretary at the table would agree with some of my comments on this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former government drew up a draft national men's health policy which, in particular, highlighted that: men have a lower life expectancy of 75 years compared with 81 for women; young men 15 to 24 are three times as likely to die as young women and more than six times as likely to commit suicide; and men aged 25 to 64 die at twice the rate of women of the same age. This draft policy also highlighted the fact that not only are men sicker but they are less likely to see their doctor. For whatever reasons, the social mores of our particular community tend to discourage men from consulting their doctor if they have a concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former government's draft national men's health policy drew up an action plan, suggesting that we needed to develop some targeted education programs and commission additional research addressing some of these specific issues that affect men's health. I admit that, at the time of the election, the former government had not had a chance to provide extra money for those action plans. But of course we were hopeful that, with the draft policy having been released late last year, a re&hyphen;elected Labor government would have found the resources to implement those measures. Certainly, I believe that the draft national health policy came up with a whole series of proposals that were worthy of funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, the current minister and the current government have not only decided not to fund the proposals but also, as was quite clear in Senate estimates, sought to suppress the report. It was admitted on 18 September, when one of the departmental officials was asked about this, that: </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6976">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The minister has asked that it not be systematically distributed and that, as a consequence, we have had to put on hold the distribution.</PARA>
<PARA>It is bad enough that the government is not prepared to fund an implementation of proposals that improve men's health. But it is even worse when the government tries to suppress informed debate about these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) addresses Liberal Party meetings in Queensland and claims that some form of political censorship has been lifted with the election of the Howard government, it is pretty hard to reconcile those claims with the decision by the minister for health to suppress the draft national men's health policy, the document that his department prepared and has been sitting on. These are the sorts of issues that, I would have hoped, all members would have been willing to debate and support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For all of these reasons, Mr Deputy Speaker, it is a pleasure to participate in this debate on grievances this afternoon. Could I end by saying that, with Geoff Gallop working hard in Western Australia, we are very sure that an elected Gallop government will increase funding for public hospitals.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> (Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<TIME.STAMP>(5.03 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the comments by the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee), I am not an expert on Western Australian politics, but I am quite confident that his side of politics will get the same result there on the appropriate day as the Australian Labor Party got on 2 March and as was repeated in the Lindsay by&hyphen;election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The matter which the honourable member was generally addressing&mdash;not his political points about social suppression and so on&mdash;that of suicide, is a matter of concern. One of the issues that the previous government did not come to grips with was that there are many things on which you would want to spend money and there are many things which deserve to have resources spent on them, but you actually have to generate the money to deal with that. That means you have to generate the wealth in the country. So what I want to talk about this afternoon perhaps <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> goes some way to how we address generating profit and wealth in this country, how we become a richer and more successful society so that we can do all of those good things that are necessary in a social sense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to talk about the importance of business and industry in this country, particularly exporting businesses. I am not talking about big companies as such, the BHPs and various other large companies because they are obviously well able to look after themselves. I want to talk about small to medium sized enterprises. I want to talk about the need for a national cultural change, for a change in the climate of the way we approach doing business, particularly at the small end of the market, and the way we look at where we sell our product.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, many small and medium sized businesses in my electorate, which is Aston in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne&mdash;and in the neighbouring electorates&mdash;produce some 46 per cent of Victoria's manufactured products and also a lot of services. In my electorate and in Australia generally, small businesses have had a fairly rough deal in the last few years. Briefly, perhaps, I remind the House that on the industrial relations front, if you go and talk to any small businessman&mdash;and there are some 8,000 in my electorate&mdash;they will tell you that probably the single biggest inhibitor to the success of their business and their prospects of employing people have been the previous government's unfair dismissal regulations. The industrial relations legislation which we are about to introduce into this country will be a big improvement in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another major bugbear that small business has had to bear over the last few years is interest rates. I well recall when I won my seat six years ago, one of the major reasons, quite frankly&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="RONALDSON" NAMEID="XT4">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XT4">Mr Ronaldson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You've increased your margin every time since then.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UT4">Mr NUGENT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And increased my margin. I thank the parliamentary secretary at the table for reminding me of that. The point I wanted to make was that interest rates, when I got elected, were well over 20 per cent for small business. That was a penalty which businesses <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6977"> in other countries that competed with us did not have inflicted upon them. And in the last few years we have seen record bankruptcies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a structural change in Australia's business. We have come out of doing most of our business with the UK since it went into Europe. We have seen the rise of many other countries selling similar products in the mining and farming sectors in South America. We have seen more competition from Asia. The challenges that now present to small business are much greater than they were a few years ago when we had comfortable markets and often a protected environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that the previous government really did not understand those issues and often compounded the problem. The new government, the Howard government, now has the opportunity to try to fix some of those issues. As I mentioned, we have already started to do so in the industrial relations area. We introduced in the budget, provided we can get them through the Senate, a number of tax changes, particularly in the capital gains area. The Small Business Task Force to reduce the load of government paperwork on small business has reported, and the government is committed to a firm deadline for responding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interest rates are at a 12-year low. I think we need to do more in terms of the banking sector, because it seems to me that a common tenet with the banks these days is that if you have money you can borrow some, but if you actually need it you do not have much chance at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We as a government probably need to do more to encourage investment in small business. A lot has been said about industry programs and R&amp;D. I think those are important, but the general business climate is really what it is all about. In some ways I would like to see government-business relationships draw closer. It is interesting that the government and industry work very closely together in many countries in our region that have had the most spectacular industry and business growth over recent years. Senior ministers of those governments have given major leads often to the business community. Places like <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Singapore and Malaysia have made massive steps.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> One of the things I have found in my electorate is that many of the small businesses that are doing well are those that are not into local domestic markets; they are those that are into exporting. The local market is pretty flat, quite frankly, in many respects. But those who are exporting&mdash;whether it be chocolates, machinery or whatever&mdash;are doing very well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that we need to encourage many more of our small businesses in this country to get into export markets. I am pleased to see that the government is currently spending some $6 million in its New Horizons promotional activity in India&mdash;a country which I was fortunate enough to visit on a delegation fairly recently, a country of 900 million people where you need only a small proportion of the market to be fairly affluent to have a huge market potential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other countries in that part of the world also have tremendous opportunities. Pakistan, where perhaps things are less stable but a country of 130 million&mdash;the 10th largest country in the world&mdash;is crying out for business links with this country. The government has declared next year, 1997, the Year of South Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For a long time we have been trying to get the culture going. The previous government, to its credit, was also going down this track of trying to increase our business with South-East Asia. We had here recently, in the last month, a series of ministers from Malaysia and Singapore. From Malaysia we had the Minister for Entrepreneurial Development&mdash;a special portfolio specifically set up in Malaysia to encourage small business generation and development in that country. We had, amongst others, the Minister for Trade and Industry from Singapore&mdash;again, a country that we have had long links and good trading ties with but a country where we can grow our business. He came here to look at further ways in which we can develop business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that in the Asian area there are many other opportunities for more Australian companies to get out there and sell their product. The message that I increasingly got whilst travelling around a number of those <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6978"> countries was that we are viewed as a country with good innovation, good technology, good techniques, good education and good skills, and those countries in Asia could do with all of those. Of course, China is the big one that presents us with many opportunities. We have the opportunity to use the networks of the many migrants in this country and to use their contacts in the countries from which they have come to help us establish some of those businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Austrade is there to encourage a lot of that assistance, but it seems to me that what many of our small businesses need to be prepared to do is get out there and look for themselves. I would certainly encourage all of those who work in a number of particular industries to get out there and have a look at the prospects in many of the countries that I have mentioned&mdash;for example, in the education field, where a number of our universities are setting up twinning arrangements, in the technology area and in the areas of health, environmental and waste management, mining, food technology and services. There is a whole range of areas where Australian companies can do very well overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst small and medium sized businesses in this country have been doing it tough over the last decade, we have now started to create a new climate in this country. But more needs to be done. It seems to me that many small and medium sized companies need to grasp the many opportunities that are out there. We need this cultural change. We need to look further afield. We need to grab the opportunities&mdash;not only for the profit of those small companies now but to fix the debt problems in this nation and to make sure that we leave our children the opportunity to provide those services that the previous speaker spoke about and are so eagerly sought.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<TIME.STAMP>(5.13 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In February this year the former Prime <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Minister, Paul Keating, travelled to my own home town, Cessnock, to commission the Jim Comerford Memorial Wall. Jim Comerford is a well-known former miners federation official who entered the coalmines at the tender age of 14. I am happy to report to the House that Jim Comerford is alive and well and is still active in the northern coalfields.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The wall was erected in the grounds of the united mineworkers' northern district office. It contains the name of 1,532 mineworkers fatally injured while attempting to win coal from the mines in the northern district. The oldest person to appear on the wall was 76 when he was killed. The youngest was just 11. The sheer number of names on the wall serves as a poignant reminder of the dangers our mineworkers face every day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 26 May this year, the first annual memorial service was held adjacent to the wall. The mineworkers' special guest on that day was the Hon. Jeff Shaw, the New South Wales Attorney-General and Minister for Industrial Relations in that state. The attorney's presence was an appropriate reminder of the important role ministers for industrial relations in all Australian legislatures play in the area of mine safety.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, last week we received another reminder of the dangerous nature of the coalmining industry. At the Gretley Colliery, just outside my electorate, four coalminers tragically lost their lives. At around 5.30 a.m. last Thursday, 19&hyphen;year&hyphen;old Damon Murray, 36&hyphen;year&hyphen;old John Hunter, 30&hyphen;year&hyphen;old Mark Kaiser and 48&hyphen;year&hyphen;old Eddie Batterham were operating a continuous miner in a development section of the mine when they broke through to abandoned workings which did not appear on the mine's maps. The old workings were holding vast quantities of water which inundated the development section in which the four men were working. Only minutes earlier, four workmates of those who were killed who were also working in that area had just left to take a meal break. The tragedy could easily have been of greater proportions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6979"> Those of us who have not worked in an underground mine, or had a father, a son, a brother or a spouse who worked in an under ground mine, could not possibly entirely grasp what the families and friends of those four men are feeling this week, nor can we adequately appreciate the conditions in which underground coalminers work or the dangers they face every day. Often, you hear people comment on the amount of money our coalminers earn. What I say, particularly with respect to underground miners, is that they deserve every cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The four miners who lost their lives last Thursday will now join their 1,532 comrades on the Jim Comerford Memorial Wall. We all hope they will be the last to have their names added, but the very nature of the industry dictates that they will not be. As legislators, we can play a role in ensuring that our coalmines are as safe as they possibly can be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are dealing here with a unique industry which has special needs. One of those needs is the need to ensure that safety issues remain at the forefront of any policy debate with respect to the industry. We need to be forever mindful of the role that the trade union movement has played in improving safety standards in the coalmining industry. Let us also be forever mindful of the fact that human nature has not changed and that even the most conscientious managers, under pressure from their masters to improve financial results, will take short cuts at the cost of safety in order to meet the demands being placed upon them. I do not make any reflection on the Gretley incident when I make that point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last Tuesday the federal cabinet agreed to a Productivity Commission inquiry into what it describes as restrictive work practices in the industry. No industry should fear a detailed assessment of its performance. I am sure all the players in the coalmining industry will always welcome scrutiny of their performance. My concern is that the Productivity Commission's real brief is to provide for the government the justification for an all&hyphen;out attack on the long hard fought conditions which protect the safety of Australian coalminers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the time remaining to me, I want to highlight for the House two very good examples of the arrogance of ministers in this government. The first one relates to Senator <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Alston, the Minister for Communications and the Arts. Some months ago, I was informed by Australia Post of its intention to move the operations of the Weston Post Office to the local video outlet. As you can imagine, Mr Deputy Speaker, I was pretty distressed about that and I made a fairly lengthy statement about it during an adjournment debate in this House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result, I made urgent representations to Minister Alston, imploring him to investigate the matter and even intervene to block the transfer. Subsequently, a public meeting was held in Weston on the issue. A large gathering attended, as did senior representatives of Australia Post. At that meeting, I proposed a resolution that called upon Australia Post to halt any further plans to transfer the operations of the post office to the local video store until Senator Alston had had an opportunity to respond to my representations. I made the representations on 14 October this year and I am still awaiting his response.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was pleased that some days after the public meeting, while Australia Post was not prepared to give a commitment on the day of the meeting that they would delay the transfer, I did receive, on 11 November, a letter from them saying they would agree to halt the transfer until I had had that response from the minister. You can understand that I was rather distressed today to receive a phone call from a constituent in Weston to tell me that the signs are now up on the post office building, informing all and sundry that the closure of the post office will take place this Friday and from Monday next week all operations of Australia Post in the town of Weston will be provided from the local video outlet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I immediately had my staff ring Australia Post to ascertain their explanation for their breach of commitment on this issue. I was told that Minister Alston has now advised Australia Post that his response to me is in the system, that indeed I should have it any time now and that they should proceed with the transfer. I say: what absolute arrogance and what a breach of promise and trust on the part of Australia Post. How arrogant is it for the minister, before even responding to my personal correspondence, to communicate his <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6980"> response to Australia Post? I still have not got his response. I have double checked with my office this afternoon. I have received no response whatsoever from Minister Alston on this issue and I say it is an absolute disgrace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second issue I want to raise relates to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp). It is an issue I have raised in this House on a number of occasions&mdash;that is, a section of road on the national highway in my electorate known as the Belford Bends.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was delighted in August last year when former Minister Brereton visited that site and announced that the government would spend some $33 million rectifying a very dangerous situation. I was delighted again when the now Minister Sharp also visited the Bends just prior to the election to announce that a coalition government would match that funding. But I was distressed when the budget was announced and there was no funding for the Belford Bends.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since then, delight has come again. On Tuesday of the last sitting week, the minister invited the Mayor of Singleton, Neil McNamara, and the general manager of the council, at two days notice to give them the good news that he had decided, in the face of all the controversy&mdash;and the pressure mounted by me and the community&mdash;that he would fund the project. What concerns me is the lack of invitation extended to me to take part in those talks and the attempt of the government to totally exclude me from the announcement in some weak attempt to ensure that I did not get any kudos from the announcement, because they know so well what an active role I have played in gaining those funds. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the statement made by Senator the Hon. John Herron last week at the ninth annual Joe and Enid Lyons Lecture at the ANU. That particular statement covered a very wide range of issues. I preface my comments about his statement on the use of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the army in agreement with ATSIC by quoting him. He stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What I am announcing today is a new coordinated project between ATSIC and the Army, that will be trialed on a pilot basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This new project, the ATSIC/Army Community Assistance Project, will have benefits for all concerned. The communities will benefit from improved environmental health conditions and from an increased skill base gained through the provision of community training by the Army.</PARA>
<PARA>Since the statement was made by the honourable senator, some Aboriginal leaders have stated that the state governments have failed in providing essential services and that now it is up to the army to bail them out, to bail the Commonwealth out. I would like to quote from an interview by <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> 's Suzanne Smith from Wednesday, 13 November, prior to the announcement. Peter Yu, the former director of the Kimberley Land Council of Western Australia, who is a proponent of greater regional autonomy for Aboriginal people, was asked for his reaction to the proposal. He answered:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, I think it's obviously an indictment, in terms of the knowledge of the current terrible existing situations that people live in, but it also raises some very serious questions about the capacity of the governments, particularly the State Government and the Commonwealth's ability to pull them into line in terms of filling their responsibility. After all, I mean, these are normal entitlements that most Australians would expect without question.</PARA>
<PARA>The minister has since made the statement at the annual Joe and Enid Lyons Lecture on 15 November. I welcome the involvement by the army in the provision of essential services in remote areas. In fact there is a provision for this in the Defence Act. Defence aid to the civil community does have several categories. Categories 4 and 5 provide:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . for non-emergency assistance to State, Territory or Local Government authorities or organisations, commercial enterprises, charity organisations or individuals or bodies in the general community, of a non-specific nature but where only the ADF can provide such assistance as and when required . . .</PARA>
<PARA>So there are provisions for the army to be able to get in and help communities. It also has a capacity during flood, fire or any other natural disaster. I am reminded of the tremendous role that the army, navy and other <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6981"> services played in the provision of emergency services after Cyclone Tracy in December 1974.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of where we are going today in the army, I think we have to look overall at ATSIC's operation. It has often been said to me that there seemed to be a higher level of productivity and outcomes when those funds were coming through the department of Aboriginal affairs. There seems to be some concern today about ATSIC's operation and the extensive funding that they receive from the Commonwealth government and that quite a bit of their money on an annual basis is being put into investment&mdash;buying properties and shopping centres, taking partnerships in car dealerships and the like. There is a general feeling that some of the funds are not getting out into the communities. That is the concern that the communities have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the army playing a role in providing essential services, I think we must be cautious. I think there needs to be a lot of consultation with and a lot of discussion between community based organisations throughout Australia. I will speak about the Northern Territory because I am aware of its organisations. We have a community government organisation, we have a local government organisation and we have a territory government, which has in its control those functional areas that provide services to remote areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am aware that, unless a consultation process is undertaken, we could be travelling into an area where we could come unstuck. I say that in a very reserved sense because what we perceive to be a priority for a community from the outside may not be the priority that they themselves want. It does take an awfully long time for them to work out amongst themselves what they see as being most important in their community, whether it be water supply, electricity supply, education, road system or recreational facilities. They have their own ideas. That is why I say that I am very cautious in my optimism about how the army is going to provide services to those remote communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Maningrida, a remote community in the Northern Territory, can at any particular time <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have a population of up to about 1,500 people. But that population base could fall away at any time to about 300 or 400 people. What basically happens is that there is an outstation movement. People move out from the outstations. There could be 20 outstations for Maningrida. In Maningrida you have all the facilities. You have health facilities, schools and administration all happening, then people move 20 or 30 kilometres away. It is very difficult in some cases to provide all those essential services to the remote communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another thing we have to take into consideration is that on many occasions in some of these remote areas when outstations are set up they might be useful for a short time and then, maybe three or four months later, there may be a reason why the area is no longer any good and those people go off to another area. So it is going to be very difficult to have the army moving around to provide essential services to outstation movements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that in some of these outstations the resources are quite extreme. Some of them have four&hyphen;wheel drives, some have aircraft to fly in and out of their outstation. I wonder why we need to have those particular facilities for outstations. It was a decision of those outstation communities to move out from the main community. It is very hard. We talk about a partnership. There is going to have to be a partnership between the federal government, ATSIC, state, territory and local government, community development and the army in the provision of essential services. The army could find it is chasing its own tail if it does not sit down and work out what its program is going to be in the delivery of those services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other important factor is land rights. We have been living with land rights in the Northern Territory for some 20 years. In 1980 a review was carried out by Barry Rowlands QC and in 1983 a most comprehensive review was done by Justice Toohey. That report was called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Seven years on</EMPHASIS>. I understand that the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory has asked the minister responsible to have another review of the Northern Territory land rights act because the land that is being controlled <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6982"> by Aboriginals in remote communities in some instances is no use to them. They have the land but they cannot really use it for tourism development or commercial development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very important to ensure before the army starts moving around and providing essential services that a review of at least the land rights act should be carried out. Each of the state governments and the territory government have the provision of being able to provide essential services to those communities, provided the Commonwealth is fair dinkum in its approach to providing additional funding resources to those government authorities which can put those essential services into place where they are required by the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We speak about roads and we speak about water but nobody is speaking about recreational facilities. Maybe those should be made available to some of these communities if the army is able to provide that kind of facility. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

That matter relates to the lifting of a suppression order in respect of evidence given by Mr Peter Kyle who was the previous commissioner for the Wanneroo City Council royal commission prior to a Supreme Court decision effectively removing him from that position.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5V5">Mr STEPHEN SMITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the point of order, I have refreshed my memory on the sub judice rule. The comments that I propose to make go to the legal argument and the importance or otherwise of suppression orders and suppressing suppression orders. I am not proposing to canvass the evidence that was given by the person whose evidence was suppressed. I am making my points on the legal application, the points made by counsel, the legal points responded to by the commission and the general nature of that going to the public interest&mdash;not the sorts of things we would have to find ourselves proceeding with very cautiously under the sub judice rule as <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6983"> you find in Browning. If I deviate from that, Mr Deputy Speaker, I rely on you to caution me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the course of legal argument, Mr Groves, counsel acting for an interested party, had the following comments to make which go to this matter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of course the matter which brings me before you on this occasion of course is in respect of the direction which you gave of Tuesday, 12 November, where you directed that there be no publication of the fact that the closure of the hearing or that it be referred to in any other manner or form and that was in the context of the evidence which Mr Laurie Fowler gave on that day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">What I should say at the outset so far as that form of direction is concerned is that it is with respect the ultimate censorship. When you cannot say or publish the fact that you have been censored, then it is the ultimate in censorship and, with respect, it goes against all the principles of open proceedings and it goes against the principles of free speech in a free democratic society.</PARA>
<PARA>Counsel went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is as much a matter of principle so far as this form of order is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">By and large of course we are willing to accept that there have been and no doubt there will be in the future appropriate and proper occasions when the reporting of evidence or the taking of evidence in camera is appropriate and I would expect that my appearance here . . . will not be so frequent.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that the media in representing the public interest has standing to make applications to be heard where the interests of the public may be affected . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is courtesy of a case called Re Broomfield in the Western Australian Supreme Court. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we are concerned on this occasion with the direction made that there be no publication of the fact of the closure of the hearing or that it be referred to in any manner or form.</PARA>
<PARA>The application effectively went to, as counsel put it subsequently:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The subject of your order was not a restriction on the publication of the evidence. It was in fact a restriction on publishing the fact that evidence from the witness had been taken in camera and that is a completely different matter from that which is the subject of section 19B(1).</PARA>
<PARA>This is in the context of the suppression order on Mr Kyle having been raised a couple of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> days later, which I have referred to. Counsel went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That brings me then, sir, to the significance of the fact that the witness gave further evidence in camera and the relevance of that and your order. Why is it relevant that the journalist wishes to include in her report of the proceedings the fact that the witness did give further evidence in camera? You might say, "Well, there's nothing much in that. Why would she want that anyway?"</PARA>
<PARA>Counsel said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We would say, sir, that in reporting the proceedings the best endeavours are always used to try and ensure that the report is fair and that it is balanced, and that it is reflective of the evidence given during the course of proceedings in the day of being reported.</PARA>
<PARA>Counsel made the following concluding comments:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If it closes the proceedings, it should give proper reasons so that the public know and are aware as to why the hearing is being closed, and if it is going to hear evidence in public and restrict any reporting of the fact that evidence has been heard in public then again it should be given proper reasons so that the public which you represent knows, understands and is aware as to the working and the operation of this commission.</PARA>
<PARA>He further said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Perceptions sometimes are stronger than reality, and I say this in all fairness because no doubt you are mindful of the perceptions which are raised and oftentimes perceptions will be raised and held where there is no factual background or reason for those perceptions to be held.</PARA>
<PARA>Counsel concluded by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the fact of the order which was made. That is the principle which we find abhorrent and, as I said at the outset, the ultimate form of censorship. It is the ultimate form of censorship in these circumstances because it also denies the opportunity for any criticism, as I said, being it ill&hyphen;informed or otherwise, to be directed at the manner in which this commission is proceeding in dealing with its inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA>The royal commissioner, in rejecting that application, in the course of his reasons said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Groves has raised a number of submissions this morning concerning the order that I made on 12 November that the fact that the closure of the hearing in relation to evidence to be given by Mr Fowler was not to be published.</PARA>
<PARA>This was said in the course of the commissioner's ruling:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6984">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It cannot be denied that the vigilance of the press is a factor in the conduct of tribunals such as this, but the proper supervisory role is of course for the courts. There are competing public interests involved.</PARA>
<PARA>Then the commissioner discussed the public interest. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As to the order prohibiting publication of the fact of closure with respect to Mr Fowler, it was put by Mr Groves that the making of such an order means in effect that observers must assume that the commission is part of some form of cover&hyphen;up to protect other interests. I reject that proposition.</PARA>
<PARA>The commissioner went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it was necessary that there be no public reference at all to the fact that he had spoken to the commission in private . . . I note that it is the first time an order of that nature has been made by this commission. It may very well be the last. Counsel . . . has not persuaded me that those interests should be subordinated to the public's desire to be kept informed in this instance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a royal commission is by its nature a flexible, dynamic and inquisitorial body. It must be able to adapt to situations which arise, often . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The point here is one of very grave concern for those people interested in accountability. A suppression order has been made and that suppression order itself is suppressed&mdash;I could not have put it better than counsel for the interested party&mdash;and the conclusion I came to was that the royal commissioner was wrong when he made his ruling that the arguments were not persuasive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question of perception is relevant because there is a state election on foot and a suppression order was lifted in respect of Mr Kyle. As I said to the chair, I will not traverse the evidence which was given because that would fly very close to the sub judice rule. I do not want to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it is clear that Mr Fowler, in the course of the evidence he gave, was proposing to refer to statements made by the staff of Richard Court. There may well have been good reasons for doing that, but the commission needs to be very careful about putting itself in that invidious perception position which it was prepared to accept.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are very important issues which go to accountability, to openness, to public scrutiny, to the way in which tribunals which <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are not courts can legitimately on a range of occasions suppress evidence in the public interest. But I think it is qualitatively different to go the next step and to say, `A suppression order has been made, but we are now proposing to suppress the fact of this suppression order.' <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<TIME.STAMP>(5.43 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On several occasions in this House, I have found it necessary to express concern about proposals to increase the allowable levels of cadmium in Australian food. In the past, these proposals have generally been instigated by food and beverage importers. There was an application a couple of years ago by the Food and Beverage Importers Association to more than double the permitted levels of cadmium in some Australian foods.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am alarmed now to learn that the National Food Authority, an organisation which I would have thought would have primarily had as its objectives to protect the quality of Australian food and to guarantee that what we eat is healthy and safe, has actually instigated its own proposal to double the permitted levels of cadmium in peanuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two proposals. Proposal 144 relates to general increases in permitted cadmium levels and proposal 148 seeks to double the permitted levels of cadmium in peanuts from 0.05 parts per billion to 0.1 parts per billion. I am concerned that such proposals are again being considered in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Cadmium is a naturally occurring metal and cannot be removed from the environment. It can accumulate in the body and, with excessive intake, gradually poison the system. It is important that exposure is restricted to the lowest possible levels. Health authorities believe that long-term exposure to cadmium can cause irreparable kidney damage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also concern that high cadmium levels may be a significant factor in the early onset of osteoporosis in post&hyphen;menopausal women. Those considered to be at high risk of cadmium poisoning include young children, pregnant women, vegetarians and smokers. It is extraordinary that the Australian National <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6985"> Food Authority, which is now linked with the food authority in New Zealand as a single organisation, would be prepared to risk the health of Australians by advocating or even considering higher levels of cadmium. The National Health and Medical Research Council said in March 1989 when considering these matters, `It is clear that any increase in cadmium levels in food is unacceptable.' At that time, they declined to support proposals for higher levels of cadmium.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Generally speaking, most Australian producers, particularly of products like peanuts, meet the current cadmium standards. Low levels of cadmium in Australian produced foods is of obvious benefit to Australian consumers. Any proposals to increase cadmium levels have always been opposed not just by health authorities but also by the Australian consumer organisations. There are obvious competitive benefits in Australia producing peanuts with low levels of cadmium. Those competitive benefits give us an advantage in trading around the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Low levels of cadmium can only be sustained with careful management and effective monitoring of production areas. In 1989 there was a case in Western Australia where peanuts imported from the United States by the Peanut Marketing Board were found to contain unacceptable levels of cadmium. Since that time, the Australian industry has taken a number of precautions to ensure that our products meet the current standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of agronomic practices have been recommended to farmers. These include lifting the pH levels, applying zinc&mdash;because zinc deficiency can result in high cadmium levels&mdash;avoiding growing peanuts in soil with a history of high phosphorus applications and growing varieties of peanuts with low cadmium uptake potential. Those measures have been adopted by growers throughout the peanut growing areas but there are some areas where, because of the potential for cadmium intake, peanuts are no longer recommended for production. The Australian industry has gone to considerable lengths to ensure that it is able to meet this high standard that has been set for cadmium levels for Australia.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead of being proud of this achievement and endeavouring to build on Australia's success in this regard, it seems the National Food Authority is now proposing that we abandon what has been achieved and relax the permitted levels of concentration of cadmium in food products. This has naturally caused alarm to the Australian industry. I recently received a letter from Mr Mal Goodger, secretary of the peanut subcommittee of the Queensland Graingrowers Association. On behalf of the Australian farmers, he expressed alarm about the rumours of raising cadmium levels for peanuts. He wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do not understand why this change in MRL for Cadmium should be undertaken as Australian producers of peanuts can meet the current Australian Standard of 0.05 ppb. We attempt to produce <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Clean Green Australian Produce</EMPHASIS>  and now find we may be undermined by these inferior imports.</PARA>
<PARA>It is his last word that is the key to why these proposals come forward regularly. While Australia works very hard and has been able to maintain low levels of cadmium, in some countries that want to export to Australia that has been more difficult. The impetus almost invariably for increased levels of cadmium has come from those who want to export to this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the Australian producers are protecting is not some  attempt at an artificial trade barrier. It would be somewhat hypocritical for any other countries of the world to point the finger at Australia in that regard. It is interesting to note that the two major peanut exporting countries are China, which totally bans the import of peanuts, and the United States, which allows some imports on a quota basis but there is a two&hyphen;tiered pricing system. US domestic producers receive $863 a tonne for their peanuts, but importers get only $495 a tonne irrespective of quality standards. It would be utterly hypocritical for any other country to point the finger at Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has been unable to produce sufficient peanuts over recent years to meet our requirements, so we do need to import some peanuts. The Peanut Co. of Australia, the major peanut organisation, has been the biggest importer of peanuts. Since 1990, it has brought in something like 25,000 tonnes from countries around the world and without <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6986"> a single cadmium problem. This is not a trade barrier. It is about maintaining quality standards. It is about recognising that we should provide Australian consumers with the best possible product.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of countries, such as China, which have considerable difficulties meeting Australia's standards. The most commonly rejected imported food into Australia is peanuts. The country from which peanuts are most commonly rejected is China. The most common reason for the rejections is high levels of cadmium. In some circumstances Chinese peanuts with more than five times the acceptable levels of cadmium in this country have been rejected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not talking now about banning imports; we are talking about bringing in imports from countries that are able to meet the standards that Australian farmers have demonstrated over the years that they are capable of meeting. It is completely illogical for us to double the levels of cadmium permitted in Australian peanuts and other foods just to accommodate the wishes of some importers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is some suggestion that there is an international standard of 0.1. Even that argument is threadbare. There are different standards in other parts of the world. New Zealand standards are something like 20 times Australia's. It really is inconsistent to suggest that we need to take this kind of action to accommodate producers in other parts of the world. Australian farmers are able to supply consumers with peanuts having very low levels of cadmium contamination. That provides real benefits for the health of Australian consumers, and there is no sensible reason why these benefits should be compromised in any way to accommodate the wishes of a few importers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I call on the National Food Authority to reject any proposals to raise cadmium levels and I call on the authority to maintain the highest possible standards for Australian consumers.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund, I present the committee's sixth report, incorporating a dissenting report, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Native Title Amendment Bill 1996</EMPHASIS> .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ordered that the report be printed.</PARA>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4K6">Mr CAUSLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Section 206 of the Native Title Act requires that this parliament address the act after two years to report on its workings. During the term of the previous government, the Brandy case raised issues which showed that there were concerns about the workings of the act. In fact the previous government had brought into this House amendments to the act, which lapsed with the prorogation of the parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report addresses the Brandy case and issues that this government has seen to be problems associated with the workings of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6987"> act. It requires that some of these amendments, if approved by the parliament, might see a smoother working of some of the areas of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee had considerable input. They travelled through some 14 areas around Australia and heard quite an amount of evidence from witnesses, which really revealed that there were problems associated with the workings of the Native Title Act and that there was a need for some amendment to that act to see that it worked smoothly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we need to go back to the findings of the High Court in Mabo No. 2 where the High Court majority confirmed that the Miriam people were entitled to possession, occupation, use and enjoyment of the lands of the Murray Islands. It was at that stage that native title was recognised. The High Court also found that in certain circumstances native title can be extinguished. I believe that last part of the decision is the nub of a lot of the problems that we have with the workings of the act today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While this report on amendments does not address that particular issue, I am sure that the report on the operations of the act, which is due to follow in a few months time, needs to address that particular issue. I might spend some small amount of time on it. If you look at the subtitles in the report dealing with extinguishment of native title, the registration of claims, mediation, future acts and representative bodies, at the nub of all of that is the need for a definition of `native title'. At this stage, the court has not clarified what they see as being the common law rights under native title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee heard various conflicting evidence, depending on whether it was coming from legal people or from those who had been advised by lawyers who were representing them. There is no doubt that the legal fraternity have endeavoured to expand this decision as much as possible. That is a worry to me. If it goes on for an extended period of time an amount of money will be expended by Aboriginal people for what might, at the end of the day, be an expectation that will not be achieved.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we take the advice of Mr Justice French, the Chairman of the Native Title Tribunal, in evidence before the committee he said that he believed the High Court decision was that there was a continuing common law right of Aboriginal people on lands where native title had not been extinguished for their right of hunting, gathering and ceremonies. In Western Australia, in Perth, there was evidence from the Aboriginal Legal Service that they believed the rights were much greater than that. In evidence, they said that they believed the Aboriginal rights were exclusive freehold rights which in fact allowed Aboriginal people the right to manage or govern that particular land they had claimed&mdash;they had rights of either granting or denying access to that land and they had mineral rights and even air rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So you can see there was a wide expanse of opinion which came from evidence put before the committee as to what native title really is. I think it really does come down to some of the problems we have. The court has come down with a decision which means that most native title claims now need to be registered. As soon as the claim is registered, there is a statutory requirement that negotiations must commence for that claimant as to their rights on that particular claim. Where we do not have an absolute clear definition of what the native title rights are that particular negotiation is very obscure, to say the least, and gives rise to these ambit claims that are presently in the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are not only ambit claims but also claims over the same land. We had evidence from Aboriginal people where they showed that in south-west Queensland, in Western Australia and in other areas there are different groups claiming the same land. In fact in Western Australia a brother and sister are claiming the same land. So we have a problem there as to the definition of how these claims could be sorted out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We talked about whether it should be the representative bodies that first looked closely at the claims to see whether it was in fact a genuine claim. Obviously, some people felt anxious about that because they believe some of the representative bodies do not represent <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6988"> them personally. That concern has been addressed in the report. If the claimants believe they are not being represented correctly by those representative bodies, they have a right to appeal to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs to have their claims heard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a very serious subject and I believe this parliament must take it seriously. Obviously, on behalf of the Aboriginal people, they believe they have a right, and in fact the High Court has come down on that decision. We found in much of the evidence that there already is friction&mdash;friction between Aboriginal people and the wider community and friction between Aboriginal people and Aboriginal people. So it needs to be clarified. Everyone can live with a law that they understand. The problem we have at the present time is that we have a law which we do not understand, and that is causing considerable problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, because of definition, we heard evidence in Western Australia&mdash;for instance, at Kununurra&mdash;that a company that had built a hydro station at the Ord River Dam has had to come to an agreement to traverse Aboriginal land to reticulate the electricity to the Kimberleys and the claims are that $3 million was paid. This particular instance, again, is evidence that, where you do not have a clear definition of what these rights are, you will get these types of claims and you will get people paying out because they do not understand. Because they have a huge investment and must get a return on that investment, they can be held to ransom. I do not believe this is a healthy situation as far as the operations of native title are concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Evidence was put before the committee that the operations of native title at the present time are inhibiting development and inhibiting exploration in the mining industry. The suggestion in the amendments that there be a once only negotiation in order to establish native title had considerable support. It also had support from the Aboriginal people where there were multiple claims. There is no doubt that, if you have an exploration licence which subsequently turns into a mining licence, any rights that Aboriginal people might have can <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> be negotiated in one negotiation and not have to be readdressed at a later date. I am sure that is an amendment which will considerably free up the title process whereby these issues can be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, I do not want to take up too much time of the parliament today, but I note that there is a dissenting report. It is disappointing that there had to be a dissenting report. I would note that the Democrat representative on the committee attended only one meeting, and then for 10 minutes. I assume the parliament will get a report from the Democrats, even though they have not heard the evidence that was put before the committee. The dissenting report comes down mostly to the anti-discrimination act. I think in many areas that has been addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has made it very clear in the parliament that this government will not do anything that will in any way affect the anti-discrimination act. I believe the amendments, as proposed by the government, will not do that either. I am at a bit of a loss to understand why the Labor Party has come in with a dissenting report on that particular issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said earlier, it is an issue which really demands bipartisan support in this parliament. It is an issue of considerable concern to all Australians. I do not dismiss the rights of the Aboriginal people. They certainly have those rights, but it also is an issue that has a large bearing on the mining industry and on people with other rights. We did have evidence before the committee to say that there was an undertaking given by the previous government that leasehold extinguished native title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, we do realise now that the Wik case has been brought since then, so obviously that undertaking was not clear, particularly in the minds of the court. We all await the findings of the Wik case because we believe that it could clarify a lot of the uncertainties within the Native Title Act at the present time. For that reason, the report recommends that one of the amendments from the government that greater rights be given to leaseholders should be dropped and that we await the Wik case to seek clarification in that way.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6989">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the report to the parliament. I believe that a lot of work was put into it and that a lot of very good evidence was given. I commend the reading of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> because I think that there is a lot of evidence in there that will reveal a lot of the problems in the working of the act. I think this is a genuine attempt to address the problems that have arisen and to see that the act works smoothly, and I hope that the amendments will be carried eventually by the parliament.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Native title is an established aspect of the legal and cultural landscape of Australia. Mabo No. 2 was handed down in June 1992 and the Native Title Act 1993 commenced from January 1994. Today the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund tabled its report on the Native Title Amendment Bill 1996. By virtue of that bill the Howard government purports to make the act more workable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee's majority report essentially agrees with the government's proposals to amend the Native Title Act. Nevertheless, two significant aspects of the committee report can be endorsed: support for the proposed amendments to address the Brandy problem&mdash;where a tribunal, such as the National Native Title Tribunal, purports to exercise the power of a court by making determinations; and the deferment of consideration of the government's proposal to permit the renewal of pastoral leases on terms more favourable to lessees, including in perpetuity, to the possible detriment of native title claimants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That said, the overall thrust of the government's proposed amendments to the act and the committee's endorsement of them are contrary to the interests of the indigenous people whose native title rights were proclaimed by the High Court little more than four years ago. For this reason, the non-government members of the native title committee dissent from the committee report and have presented their own minority report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minority report analyses the government's proposed amendments and the committee's approval of them. It does so resting on the conviction that the Native Title Act is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a finely balanced statute encompassing the interests of various parties. A compromise was reached and some significant concessions were made by indigenous people. Amendments need to preserve that balance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even more importantly, the amendments must not depreciate the common law native title rights of indigenous people. Extinguishment of native title, either inadvertently or by stealth, must be resisted. The act will not in fact be more workable if native title holders are forced to resort to the courts in defence of their rights. The most workable arrangement is the process of mediation by which reasonable claims can be settled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to its regard for the original Native Title Act, the minority report respects the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 by giving it primacy over the Native Title Amendment Bill 1996. The Racial Discrimination Act 1975 is effectively our bill of rights by making us all equal. It was a cornerstone of the Mabo decision. Amendments to the Native Title Act, which has as an objective the protection of native title, must not be inconsistent with the Racial Discrimination Act. A number of the government's proposed amendments are vulnerable to such scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Accordingly, the minority report is founded on two crucial elements. They are: the acceptance and preservation of the common law on native title&mdash;extinguishment must not be further effected by statute and where there is doubt about the extinguishment of native title the courts must decide; and, to avoid any doubt, it is imperative that the provisions of the amendment bill make it clear that the intention of the parliament is that the terms of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 shall prevail over all provisions amending the Native Title Act 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In view of some words that were spoken at a press conference and that have been tabled in the Senate, I wish to read from the minority report on pages 3 and 4. At 2.2 it says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Coalition Policy states that it will respect the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act. The Coalition Government has confirmed on many occasions and at the highest level that it will respect the RDA. The first Outline document <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6990"> `Towards a More Workable Native Title Act' (May 1996) advises (p1):</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's policy prior to the election was to ensure the NTA's workability but in so doing to respect the provisions of the RDA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 6 May 1996, in response to a question by Mr D Melham MP, Prime Minister Howard confirmed:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has no plans to introduce any amendments to the Racial Discrimination Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 21 May 1996 in response to a question from Mr B H Wakelin MP concerning amendments to the Native Title Act, Prime Minister Howard said:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We also said that we would respect the principles of the Racial Discrimination Act, and we will.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is consistent with the policy of all political parties. To avoid any doubt it is imperative that the provisions of the Amendment Bill make it clear that the intention of the Parliament is that the terms of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Racial Discrimination Act</EMPHASIS>  1975 shall prevail over all provisions amending the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Native Title Act</EMPHASIS>  1993.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>With that we make a recommendation that the following be adopted into the Native Title Amendment Bill 1996:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Without limiting the general operation of the <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Racial Discrimination Act 1975</EMPHASIS>  in relation to the provisions of the <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Native Title Act 1993</EMPHASIS> , the provisions of the <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Racial Discrimination Act 1975 </EMPHASIS> are intended to prevail over provisions of this Act.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The provisions of this Act do not authorise conduct that is inconsistent with the provisions of the <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Racial Discrimination Act 1975</EMPHASIS> .</PARA>
<PARA>It is the opposition's intention that the Racial Discrimination Act prevail over the amendment act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consistent with these principles, the minority report has recommended against numerous proposals to amend the Native Title Act. In essence, those proposals would: install what would amount to a 15-part registration test for native title applications that would be onerous for the tribunal to administer and draconian in its effect on applicants; deny access to the right to negotiate over development proposals to those whose applications do not pass the unreasonable registration test; and provide for a once only right to negotiate over developments, potentially covering both exploration and mining, and denying native title holders what is one of their rights&mdash;to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> negotiate entry to their country for a range of purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposals would also allow intervention by the minister at any stage once a future act notice had been issued for three months. This would effectively deny the right to negotiate in such circumstances. Prior to any consideration by an arbitral body, the proposals would permit the minister to allow a development on what could be native title country. They would limit mediation to a narrow scope: it would effectively be limited to matters that would be litigated in a court. They would also limit all negotiations under the right to negotiate to four months: at present six months are allowed before arbitration concerning mining can begin. The proposals would limit to physical, and not include spiritual, the kind of interference that could prevent use of the expedited procedure for developments. Finally, the minister may make decisions to recognise or derecognise native title representative bodies on quite inadequate grounds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minority report regards these proposals by the government to be self-evidently unacceptable. They are grossly unfair, do not respect the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act and could result in increased delays to development proposals as indigenous people pursue their common law rights through the courts. In any event, the government has not shown that the act as it is being administered requires anything like these amendments in order for it to be workable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The Native Title Act consists of 127 pages. The government's amendment bill and exposure draft amount to 161 pages. Given the significance of the issues, the complexity of the bill and the length of the associated documentation, further consideration of the proposed amendments is necessary. The opposition endorses the recommendation to request a continuing referral to the native title committee until 13 December 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important, especially in the current climate, that all political parties and stakeholders work in a constructive manner in an effort to achieve consensus on the proposed amendments. Prime Minister Howard promised that the amendments were `not some kind of Trojan Horse to gut the Act'. He also <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6991"> expressed the hope that he would draw the support of the opposition and the Australian Democrats for the amendments. There is still some way to go to ensure that this comes to  fruition. That is why there needs to be a lot more consultation with all the parties concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am disappointed that some members of the government have chosen to criticise the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Cheryl Kernot, for not attending all the committee meetings. The reality is that commitments precluded her from attending the majority of the hearings. However, it should be noted for the record that she did send a staff person along to most of the hearings to monitor and report back.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We made this minority report available to government members before its tabling today. The normal process is that minority reports only surface during the tabling of a committee report. The Labor Party stands here ready to work with the government to achieve workable amendments&mdash;workable amendments that do not derogate from indigenous people's rights. I am sure that with some goodwill we can achieve this. There will not be total unanimity in some of these amendments&mdash;there will be differences of opinion&mdash;but that is the way it should be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One thing that we will not walk away from is the commitment to the Racial Discrimination Act in relation to subsequent amendments to the Native Title Act 1993. We do not want to be misrepresented in relation to that. It is in the policy of all political parties. For the government not to accept that amendment, which we say relates only to the amendment bill, I think exposes some doublespeak. Hopefully, we will work our way through the issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the whole of the report and the minority report to members of the House as part of the process of working towards a more workable Native Title Act. The act can be improved. In the current climate, it is important that we send a signal to the wider community that we can achieve cross-party support. However, there are some principles we on this side of the House will not walk away from. We will not say one thing and do <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> another in terms of our respect for indigenous people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will be debating this bill in the week of 2 December. I can flag now that the Labor Party will not be moving detailed amendments during the House of Representatives debate. We will leave the detailed amendments to the act until the bill reaches the Senate. The only amendment that we will be moving at this stage in the House of Representatives will be the amendment relating to the Racial Discrimination Act.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB2></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1996 contains nine diverse provisions. It enables general debate on the government's taxation policies as well as scrutiny of the specific measures. One of the disappointments about the government's handling of the bill is that so little time has been allowed for industry and public consultation on its provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the detail of these measures, those with an interest in the whole range of industry organisations, plus members of the general public, have been allowed less than three weeks to consider the detail. The second reading was issued by the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) on 31 October. Now, less than three weeks later, the House is expected to deal with this technical, complex set of provisions&mdash;nine diverse matters&mdash;in parliamentary debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition flags its disappointment that the government, on these taxation matters, is not allowing for more public scrutiny. The government, when it is hurting regional Australia through changes to the taxation treatment of cooperative companies, is not allowing more time for consultation. The government is running down our reputation and capacity as a clever country through these changes on the taxation treatment of research and development and is not allowing more time for public comment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The Australian Labor Party, the opposition, is supporting three measures we announced when in government: first, the changes to the regime for tax exempt entities; second, the anti-avoidance provisions for infrastructure borrowings; and, third, the improved taxation treatment of equity investments. Further, the opposition will not oppose three new measures introduced by the government in the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> legislation. The first of those is the withdrawal of the tax exemption on income for the sale of mining rights; second, anti-avoidance provisions relating to superannuation annuities and pensions; third, the coalition's election commitment on tax rebates for self-funded retirees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The opposition, however, has concerns about three matters, and on two of those we will be seeking to move amendments at the consideration in detail stage. The first involves changes to the taxation treatment of R&amp;D&mdash;the termination of the syndication provisions plus the reduction of the 150 per cent concessional deduction to 125 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second item of concern involves changes to the taxation treatment of marketing cooperatives&mdash;something that will have a devastating impact in Queensland as well as other parts of the Commonwealth. The current law, which has been in place for 60 years, allows a 200 per cent deduction for the cost of assets purchased by cooperatives with funds borrowed from a government&mdash;that is, normal depreciation is allowed on the asset and, in addition, a tax deduction is allowed to the cooperative for the repayment of the principal amount of the loan. The opposition opposes the repeal of this provision in the context of a dead flat economy and other cuts impacting severely on regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The third item where we express concern, but not necessarily amendments in the detail stage, is lifting the threshold for the 20 per cent rebate on large out&hyphen;of&hyphen;pocket medical expenses from $1,000 to $1,500. It is the opinion of the opposition, and it is expressed in my second reading amendment, that this provision will erode universality and the safety net features of Medicare and will continue the government's undesirable path towards a two-tier health system in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Day by day the government's tax policy is becoming less rational and less fair, particularly with its impact on the ordinary PAYE taxpayer. The reason and fairness of the Howard government's tax policy is unravelling day by day. Let me just provide some of the examples dealt with in my second reading amendment. The first of those involved the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in question time <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6993"> today and on other occasions talking about the government's belief, saying that it should not be imposing higher taxes on battlers. This defies any credibility or element of truth whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The PAYE taxpayer in Australia is dragging the extra load under this government's tax policies. I refer the House to Budget Statement No. 1, page 482. It provides a graphic illustration of the extra load that the PAYE taxpayer is dragging and carrying in Australia under this government's policies. In 1995&hyphen;96, gross PAYE income tax collections, as a proportion of all Commonwealth revenue, was 46.4 per cent. For the current financial year, the forecast under Treasurer Costello is an increase of 0.7 per cent to 47.3 per cent. So the extra burden in Commonwealth revenue is being carried by the ordinary PAYE taxpayer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was again stretching credibility and truth to hear the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in question time talking about a $1 billion benefit for taxpayers through the so-called family tax initiative. In truth, through the impact of bracket creep and fiscal drag in the first Costello budget, those gains are being wiped out with interest before they even start. If we look at the extra collection on gross PAYE&mdash;I refer the House again to Budget Paper No. 1, page 428&mdash;we find that there is a change on 1995-96&mdash;an increase of 8.3 per cent. That is, for every $100 of gross PAYE paid under the Keating government, under the first year of the Howard government the average taxpayer will in fact be paying $108.30&mdash;an 8.3 per cent increase in the first year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that increase and the extra revenue collection of $4.4 billion, perhaps 5.5 per cent could be explained away in terms of an increase in nominal GDP&mdash;the growth rate, probably overestimated in the budget, of 3.5 per cent plus CPI at the headline rate of two per cent. There is a nominal GDP increase of 5.5 per cent. Where then is the rest of the 8.3 per cent increase in gross PAYE? Of course, it comes out of bracket creep. It comes out of this government allowing the average PAYE taxpayer around Australia to move into higher brackets. There is the impact of nominal GDP <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> growth, particularly through inflation, plus the impact of ordinary PAYE taxpayers moving into higher brackets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, through that measure, that uncorrected aspect of bracket creep and fiscal drag, in 1996-97 will be collecting an additional $1.5 billion. So that is the real burden and the real impact of this government's policy on the average taxpayer&mdash;the family tax initiative wiped out before it even starts. In fact, there will be an additional $1.5 billion collected through bracket creep and fiscal drag not corrected by this government.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="K26">Mr LATHAM</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the dinner break I was pointing out how, day by day, the government's taxation strategies are being exposed as more irrational and more unfair. Let me just quote from the editorial of the current edition of the journal of the Australian Taxpayers Association:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When a marginal tax rate exceeds 100 per cent then something is seriously wrong. In the case of the Medicare surcharge, the effective marginal rate is closer to 50,000 per cent. For families the rate is 100,000 per cent. This occurs because individuals who exceed the threshold of $50,000 by a single dollar will be required to pay an additional one per cent on the entire amount. The effective tax payable on that one dollar is $500. For families the tax payable on that one dollar is an additional $1,000.</PARA>
<PARA>It is a rare moment in the history of the Commonwealth, one would think, when a government has introduced an effective marginal tax rate of 100,000 per cent on some families in Australia. This is an extraordinary thing, a government claiming its tax policy is family friendly when in fact for some families there is a 100,000 per cent marginal tax rate in relation to the Medicare surcharge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Beyond that, my amendment to the second reading makes mention of the way in which the government are actively disadvantaging women in Australia when they pursue not only a family but also paid employment. The social engineers of the Lyons Forum have a lot to answer for when one assesses the statistics for financial incentives for a woman re&hyphen;entering the work force in Australia, following the passage of the government's so&hyphen; <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6994">called tax initiative. These statistics take account of, in this instance, a husband's income of $25,000 per annum, three children in the family and various options for a wife's earnings. They take account of family payment, basic parenting allowance, the family tax initiative parts A and B, child care net costs and the costs of working in calculating the final marginal tax rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know the member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) will be interested in this because he has been one of the social engineers. For that family unit, with the husband's income of $25,000 and the number of children is three, if the wife were to rejoin the work force and earn $1,000 the final marginal tax rate would be 76 per cent. If the wife were to earn $4,000 upon rejoining the work force the final marginal tax rate would be 70 per cent. With an earnings level of $26,000 the final marginal tax rate is 66 per cent. That means that for a family type with the husband's income of $25,000, the wife's earnings of $26,000 and with three children in the family&mdash;perhaps the typical Australian family in the 1990s; no sign of a white picket fence there, this is more likely&mdash;the Howard government has its hands in the pockets of that family in its tax take to the tune of 66 per cent as a final marginal tax rate. That is a shameful outcome of this government's social engineering, which is denying choice and economic opportunity to women in Australia who hope to re&hyphen;enter the work force, who hope, fairly enough, to combine the opportunity of having a family and the opportunity for paid employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The figures get even worse. When the husband's income starts out at $40,000 and the number of children is three, if the wife were to earn $4,000 the final marginal tax rate is a shameful 80 per cent. If the wife were to attempt to rejoin the work force and earn $18,000, the final marginal tax rate is a shameful 78 per cent. When earning $25,000, the tax rate is almost 87 per cent&mdash;almost taking the whole lot. So for women in the family type where the husband might earn $40,000, the wife $25,000 and they have three children, this government is virtually taking the lot. That truly is a shameful indictment of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the type of social engineering of those who would deny women the choice which is so reasonable in our society, to combine the opportunities and enjoyment of a family with the opportunities and benefits of a working career.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On other aspects of this legislation the opposition believes passionately that this is not the time to cut the R&amp;D arrangements and this is not the time to hurt regional Australia through changing and lessening the taxation treatment of cooperative companies. The opposition believes the economy is so flat and the government has reduced growth to such a low level that any move to cut the R&amp;D taxation concessions or to hurt marketing cooperatives in regional Australia is absolutely an act of folly. It is fair to say, looking at the current economic circumstances of low growth and sluggish opportunities particularly in the retail and housing sectors in Australia, that the only thing the Treasurer has growing at the moment is his lawn; the only thing this Treasurer can truly grow is the lawn we read so much about in his newspaper articles. The provisions in this bill are relative to a critique of this government's failure to adopt a high growth economic strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We  know  the  Treasurer  is  a  drifter. Throughout his time in politics he has kept drifting from position to position, issue to issue, without the anchors of conviction, commitment, passion and new ideas in public life&mdash;a true drifter. At the moment he has drifted into the arms of Treasury orthodoxy in a fashion that really has sullied the scope of high growth economic strategies for this financial year and beyond. As he drifts we see again the limits of the Treasury line: a narrow attachment to the twin deficits theory and the competitive advantage paradigm. They failed in the past and they will, as certain as night follows day, fail again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Treasury line of orthodox economic theory has no analytical framework by which it can deal with the cultural and spatial dimensions of economic activity. It, through the construction of certain assumptions about factor and market conditions, is essentially a one&hyphen;dimensional discipline centred on market transactions and resource flows. This reflects <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6995"> the way in which last century economics was deemed to be a science and its impact on society could be judged through a series of mathematical formulae.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cultural habits of a society&mdash;particularly elements of thrift, industry and innovation&mdash;were deemed to be exogenous to the scientific predicability of economic events. Just as much, the civil and spatial relationships upon which society itself is based were deemed to be disconnected from the workings of a free market. With an assumption that each of the factors of production were fully mobile, space and distance simply did not matter. That is why within the Treasury orthodoxy they give no regard to funding the cost of distance in Australia. They give no regard to the type of taxation arrangements that are needed to benefit cooperative companies&mdash;of crucial importance, as you would realise, Mr Deputy Speaker, to rural and regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Commonsense tells us that both culture and space do matter in the management of an economy, especially in a nation like ours. Australia, given its unique geographical location, the limited size and yet wide dispersion of its markets, its complex cultural features, does not easily fit the textbook economic model. In Australia, the cultural and spatial dimensions of economic activity not only matter but are all-important; they are absolutely critical.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By sticking to the textbook and the orthodox Treasury line, the government makes mistake after mistake in its economic management. This is the drift and malaise of those unable to develop new ideas and policies suiting uniquely Australian conditions. As we note the flatness in the Australian economy, it is important to reflect on the flaws that this government has brought to economic strategy, to national economic policy making.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first flaw is the lack of a spatial dimension: failing to realise that markets are imperfect in a country as big as ours. There is an active role for the public sector in funding the cost of distance in Australia. That is why the Labor Party argues passionately that now is not the time for reducing the taxation concessions available to cooperative companies.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rural and regional Australia is feeling the impact of budget cutbacks more than any other part of the country. In the regions&mdash;I include the fringe of metropolitan areas that I so proudly represent in the south&hyphen;west of Sydney&mdash;for every $1 cut in public spending for the inner city my estimate is that $2 or $3 are impacting on those regional economies throughout the country. Now is not the time to lift the scab on those cuts. Now is not the time to aggravate the wound. Now is not the time to punish cooperative companies with such a piddly return to the Commonwealth revenue situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second flaw in the government's economic strategy is the lack of a cultural dimension. Australia's poor savings problem is more cultural&mdash;that is, it is a private sector phenomenon rather than a public sector one. The Treasurer, Mr Costello, is treating the wrong patient with his budget strategy. These cuts to the public sector, all in the name of national savings, are not producing the results that he would wish.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I received earlier today an answer to a question I placed on notice to the Treasurer. There is always the assumption, with his bravado in question time, that economics is so precise that all these things can be calculated out. I asked him about the estimated impact of the budget on national savings. This is what he had to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Budget papers do not provide an estimate of the net effect of the announced fiscal consolidation measures on national saving. The net effect on national saving would depend on any consequential changes in private saving, which could not be estimated with any degree of accuracy because of the difficulty of separating out the effects of other influences on private saving.</PARA>
<PARA>This demonstrates conclusively the folly of the twin deficits theory, the assumption that an increase in public savings has no consequential impact on private savings in Australia. I would argue that most of the public savings measures the government has embarked on, including those in this legislation, are nothing more than a transfer from the private savings of Australians to the public savings and coffers of the Commonwealth. There is no precision in this. There is no degree of certainty by which the Treasurer is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6996"> managing economic strategy in Australia. He needs a cultural dimension, one that recognises that the private sector bears a heavy burden in improved national savings performance. He is, in many respects, treating the wrong patient with his flawed attachment to the twin deficits theory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third flaw is the lopsided nature of the coalition's micro&hyphen;reform. They love labour market reform, but where is the product market reform? Where is the service market micro-reform under this government? All we see in that regard are crude attempts at National Party rent seeking and special pleading.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With concern to the labour market, the government fails to understand that it is not a market that easily fits the textbook model. It is not like the market for dead fish&mdash;an expression of supply and demand with pricing outcomes. It is a market that has dual features in an open economy&mdash;a strong spatial dimension and important collective elements of cooperation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fifth element of the government's flawed economic strategy driving down growth and mismanaging Australia's economic circumstances relates to the twin deficits. I have dealt with that earlier and in previous speeches in the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has also jettisoned wages policy at a time when monetary and fiscal policy are converging. In the hands of national governments, on an international scale, wages policy is very much the main discretionary tool for macro-management. In Australia, the Reserve Bank through the absence of wages policy and the accord has lost its security blanket by which it can judge forward movements in wage fundamentals. As the Reserve Bank engages in forward looking monetary policy, it has lost the security by which it can judge forward looking wage outcomes. It has lost the security blanket of an accord of effective wages policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The abandonment of wages policy by this government has placed a new speed limit on growth in Australia, another reason why now is not the time for these draconian cuts to R&amp;D and cooperative companies throughout the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The seventh area of flawed economic strategy is that the government has fundamentally misjudged the nature of the business cycle in Australia. Between 1983 and 1996, Australia was proudly near the top of the OECD growth table. We are now falling off the back of the next upswing in the international business cycle, falling towards the bottom of those OECD growth tables.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is misjudging the turning point in the cycle. There are mixed messages in the stock and spending cycle in Australia: the patchy nature of sectoral growth, the patchy nature by which the economy is trying to move from sluggish arrangements to the next upswing in the business cycle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To add insult to injury, to rub salt into the wound, the government in its budget strategy is knocking half a per cent off GDP. That is the Treasury estimate. Treasury takes such an orthodox view of arguments about the crowding in and the crowding out effect in the economy that it is probably much greater than half a per cent of GDP being lost because of the contractionary economic strategy, of which this bill is part.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has flattened growth. As I mentioned earlier, the only thing that is growing in Australia is the Treasurer's lawn&mdash;the lawn we read so much about in newspaper articles. It is the only thing he can grow. He is not growing the Australian economy. Moreover, on the eighth area of failed economic strategy he has no answers on the crucial question of unemployment. The nation's No. 1 economic problem and its main priority for policy is to reduce unemployment in Australia. Yet this financial year it is very likely that the unemployment rate will cut through the nine per cent mark and keep on rising. The Treasurer has locked himself into the competitive advantage paradigm, but you still have exclusion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would argue that you can have all the competition policy and micro reform under the sun, but in an open economy a number of citizens and workers will still be excluded from playing an active role in the economy. A leading paradox of modern capitalism is that it seemingly solves the problems of production and wealth generation, yet a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6997"> significant number of citizens remain excluded from the production process. The semi&hyphen;permanent high rates of unemployment in most Western nations are a result of market failure&mdash;a mismatch between the mobility of capital on a global scale and relative immobility of labour market skills and participants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Within this framework the government is making two serious mistakes. The first is that, in its national savings strategy, it has engaged in the folly of cutting the stimulus to exogenous growth influences in the economy. There is no easy answer in an open economy. There is no simple tax and spend formula by which you can pump prime the national economy out of an unemployment problem. You get spill&hyphen;over effects on the external account. The key to growth is to stimulate those exogenous growth factors: the R&amp;D, the infrastructure and the universities of this nation&mdash;the clever country agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This really is the wrong time for the government to be running down the capacity for Australian industry, in manufacturing and services, to engage in research and development. If we want to boost economic growth beyond the tax and spend formula we need a boost to those exogenous growth factors. R&amp;D bulks large. R&amp;D is absolutely critical to the attainment of the clever country agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is engaged in the folly of cutting government services. Hence, that lowers employment in the non-traded sector. It is also engaged in the folly of not preserving effective regional employment initiatives. The member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) would know this more than most: the government is engaged in folly by changing the taxation treatment of cooperatives. If there is one part of Australia that has felt the burden of these budget cuts it is regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We even had the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp)&mdash;regional development in name but not deed&mdash;abolishing regional development, saying that the Commonwealth has no constitutional or funding responsibility for regional development. He is just a National Party member dressed in Liberal Party clothes. He is a just a National Party member mouthing all the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> rhetoric and ideas of his Liberal Party colleagues around the cabinet table engaged in the orthodox Treasury line which says that space or distance does not matter in the Australian economy. There is no role for the public sector to fund the cost of distance. It is no surprise then that the National Party has rolled over, has been knocked over, in the stampede to change the taxation treatment on cooperatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I noted with great interest, as I know other members did, all those powerful resolutions out of the recent National Party conference&mdash;resolutions echoed by the member for Kennedy&mdash;saying that they should have a distinctive role, they should be standing up, almost McEwen style, putting the argument for funding the cost of distance in our large country.</PARA>

They are rolling over on major issues like the taxation treatment of marketing cooperatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party has a different approach to this. We do not see competition policy and the principle of competitive neutrality as an end in itself. It must be linked to two tests. The first of those is: does it add to international competitiveness? I would argue in this case no. The second test is: is there a likelihood of jobs and services being replaced to compensate for those lost? One would imagine that it is very hard in regional Australia to replace the jobs that will be lost by running down the Commonwealth's taxation treatment of cooperatives. There is no replacement effect. The Treasury line argues for the replacement effect, but those on the ground who know the spatial and regional dimensions of economic activity know that there is no easy replacement effect. We on this side of the House believe passionately that by both those tests there is no need to abolish the taxation concessions available to marketing cooperatives in Australia.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6998">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why do it when the budgetary returns are so sparse? Why do it when all we are talking about is a $2 million gain in the 1996&hyphen;97 financial year? The financial gains to the Commonwealth to 1999&hyphen;2000 will be no greater than $6 million. Why attack jobs, investment and economic opportunities in regional Australia for such a small return on the budget of the Commonwealth?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the same government that can find $500 million in taxation concessions to fill the already bloated coffers of private health insurance funds in Australia. This is a government that can find $80 million for the big banks and construction companies in tollway infrastructure concessions. This is a government that can find hundreds of thousands of dollars to fix up wardrobes and security at Kirribilli House&mdash;all for the convenience of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and his family. If it is good enough for the Prime Minister at Kirribilli, why is it not good enough for cooperative companies in North Queensland and other parts of the Commonwealth when the financial gain this financial year would be no more than $2 million?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a government with its priorities upside down. This is a government with its economic strategies upside down. It argues that things should go up when we all know that the economy is going down. When it argues for more jobs we know that fewer jobs are being provided and created in regional Australia. Now is not the time to sully the agenda of the clever country by reducing the R&amp;D tax concessions. Now is not the time to aggravate the wound in regional Australia by abolishing these taxation arrangements for marketing cooperatives.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They often say in this place that you are only regarded as being as good as your last speech. I imagine that people listening to the speech of the member for Werriwa (Mr <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Latham) tonight might be very disappointed indeed. If he is one of the leading lights of the Labor Party frontbench, I wonder what the people of Liverpool in his electorate must have wondered&mdash;if indeed they could have understood one word that he said. He was full of big words, sweeping statements and flowery language that would not have meant anything to the average person; in fact, it would have meant hardly anything to anybody in this place if they had been bothered to listen. I could hear J&hyphen;curve economics coming through the whole time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard some of this rubbish before when you people were on this side of the House. It did not make any sense then, and it does not make sense now. We do not support this ridiculous amendment. I will deal with it in detail in a moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Werriwa accuses this government of benefiting from fiscal drag. That would be just another case of the pot calling the kettle black. Time after time we are going to be able to come into this place and remind them of what happened during the 13 years that they were in government. The underlying cause of fiscal drag is inflation. The member for Werriwa did not mention it, but he might well have mentioned that we are now in a very low inflation environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the early years of the previous Labor government, during high inflation, that is when there was fiscal drag. That is when fiscal drag really had an effect and when it did disadvantage people seriously. So there is no sense in which we are benefiting to any great extent from fiscal drag. It was, for the former Labor government, an enormous revenue grab. Like all the revenue it grabbed from the Australian people, most of it was wasted on programs and all sorts of policies that did not work and in fact often had the opposite effect to what was intended. They not only wasted the money that they raised that way but borrowed money and wasted it and, in the end, they wasted opportunities to set Australia in the right direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now, in this amendment, they accuse the government of substantially increasing the tax burden on ordinary PAYE taxpayers. The member for Werriwa could not and did not <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6999"> argue for that proposition. He pointed out some ridiculous, distorted, exaggerated examples of effects of marginal tax in extreme circumstances. He does not talk about the way average tax rates have moved. He just did not argue. In fact, the proposition is quite wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since this government was elected we have done exactly the opposite. We have decreased, not increased, the burden on ordinary PAYE taxpayers. The family tax initiative is one example of that. We are having a broad ranging debate here, because the member took considerable licence with the bill we have got before us. It might well have been an appropriation debate that he was speaking on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have delivered money into the pockets of Australian families at every turn. The latest example of that was spoken about in question time today. Our responsible budget which, after all, was aimed to redress&mdash;or fill in, if you like&mdash;the $8 billion black hole that we were left with has led to lower interest rates. Already the immediate benefits of that for Australian families are perfectly obvious.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the average Australian family with the average mortgage there will be perhaps an additional $100 a month&mdash;perhaps as much as $25 a week&mdash;in after tax income. So the proposition that this government has in some way increased the tax burden on ordinary PAYE taxpayers is plainly ridiculous and wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Werriwa argues that the government's tax and transfer policies disadvantage women. Once again the actual opposite is the case. This government has been, by virtue of the family tax initiative, aiming to reverse the very disadvantage that women had under the previous government. Under the previous government, women were actually conscripted into the work force by virtue of economic necessity. There was no such thing as choice for many Australian families under the previous government. This government's policies have been aimed to allow that choice. So we refute the second plank in this amendment that in some way our policies disadvantage women who choose to have both family and paid work. We actually facilitate that choice, and that is what our policies aim to do. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What choice have families had in the past? The member for Werriwa accuses some of us on this side of being social engineers. We have just come out of 13 years of social engineering extraordinaire. We have never seen social engineering like that which we saw over the past 13 years. If there is anything to be done, it is social unengineering&mdash;exactly the opposite&mdash;to undo some of the disastrous social policies that were enforced on us by the previous government and some of the bureaucrats that essentially ran the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member even has the audacity, in talking about the way this government is spending money, to criticise the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) for some minor alterations that he made to his home at Kirribilli, but at least he did not install a heated dog kennel, like the former Prime Minister did over the road at the Lodge here. We are not into heated dog kennels or some of those other extraneous luxuries that we saw. Two can play that game, if the member wants to stoop to criticising expenditure at that particular level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that the member for Werriwa accused the Treasurer (Mr Costello) of not growing the Australian economy. What he does by suggesting that the Treasurer should be doing that is exhibit for all of us to see where he is really coming from as one of the leading economic lights on the opposition front bench. He simply believes that, like the former Treasurer&mdash;the world's greatest Treasurer, as he was called at one stage&mdash;the current Treasurer should have his hands on those levers every day, that he should have the Governor of the Reserve Bank in his pocket.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, this Treasurer has a vastly different approach to the running of the government's finances, and it is not one of hands on intervention and interference. He is not there to grow the economy. We on this side are not in a sort of stimulate or perish mode. To some extent at times there is a case for fiscal stimulus, but the opportunity was destroyed by the previous government which continued to force this country into debt during times of strong economic growth when <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7000"> it ought to have been practising what it is now preaching&mdash;that is, doing exactly the opposite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am disappointed with the speech by the member for Werriwa, firstly, because I do not think most people would be able to understand most of it and, secondly, because the sort of ideology we hear coming across is what we heard for 13 years. It did not work and this government was elected to fix the problems that were created. In the budget we went about doing that. Sure, there is some pain in that budget&mdash;we have acknowledged that&mdash;but it is pain that is spread evenly, which the Australian people have recognised. In fact, the Australian people elected us to do the job properly, and it is a job for which the Treasurer has received a lot of justified, deserved congratulations as a result of the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have set about getting the government's spending in line. In the particular legislation we are dealing with, there are pluses and minuses, but the underlying effect of these changes&mdash;as with all of our changes in the budget&mdash;is they are fair. The pain is spread as evenly as possible and, by and large, people have accepted that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An example of this is the Lindsay by-election. If there was an opportunity for people to express their dissatisfaction with the direction in which this government was going, they had the ideal opportunity to do so at the Lindsay by&hyphen;election. They not only did not do it at all but also actually came further in the government's direction. They substantially and overwhelmingly endorsed the government's strategy. So I believe it is still the case that people realise we were elected to do a job and we set about doing it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> I wanted to make a few remarks to do with a couple of aspects of this bill. They are particularly to do with the delivery of what I saw as one of our major election commitments&mdash;that is, to recognise the plight of low income, self-funded retirees, or independent retirees as they are often called. They are a group of Australians who were completely ignored by the previous government mainly because, I suspect, the Labor Party saw those people who had saved and managed to pro vide for their own retirement as somehow privileged, but they were not. Very often at the low income level of independent retirees they were actually worse off than people who were social security beneficiaries on the same level of income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The retirees who are proudly, I believe, regarded as self-funded or partially self-funded are so because they were fortunate in some cases, but in many cases they were prudent enough to have provided for their own retirement. They chose not to be a burden on the public purse and did exactly what all people are now being exhorted to do. In my view, and because I have a lot of these particular people in my electorate, there was never any reason why they should have been discriminated against. After all, they were doing what we are now expecting everybody to attempt to do. In my view, it was never acceptable that they should have been discriminated against in the tax system and in a number of other ways.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very pleased to stand here in this House tonight and see the government delivering on that particular pre-election commitment. It is a very important commitment, and I am pleased to have been one of the prime advocates for this group of people and the policy this particular bill implements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By virtue of this bill, low income, self-funded retirees at or above pension age will receive equitable tax treatment with the tax treatment of pensioners who receive a tax rebate, which raises their effective tax free threshold. The maximum rebate is $1,157 for a single pensioner and $805 for each member of a couple. The rebate for 1996-97 is a transitional one that will be equivalent to half of the current pensioner rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many other benefits in this budget for this particular group of people which, as I say, were ignored by the former government. Our health fund initiative of providing assistance for people to pay for their private health insurance will benefit a lot of these people. Many of these people&mdash;and, indeed, a lot of pensioners&mdash;have struggled to maintain their private health fund contributions. So that particular initiative, which is in the process of being implemented, will also <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7001"> benefit people as from 1 July 1997. I need to emphasise that that particular rebate will give couples earning under $70,000 a rebate of up to $250 per annum whether or not the person is liable for income tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that context, the member for Werriwa criticised the health funds. We on this side have made statements. The relevant minister has made statements and, indeed, the Prime Minister has made statements expressing concern. He pointed out, as the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) did in the parliament today, how many increases health funds had been routinely approved during the 13 years of the previous Labor government. Attention has been focused on those requests for increases and they are not necessarily being routinely approved; they are only being approved in the context of making sure that the health funds remain viable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, that is important but, nevertheless, it is disappointing that the timing of some of those increases may impact to some extent on our proposal to give people subsidies to assist with their private health insurance. Quite clearly, the bottom line is that the people who continue to maintain their private health insurance will be better off either way. They would have been substantially worse off as the health funds increased premiums, as they no doubt would have if it were not for this particular initiative. So in that sense it is doubly welcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The measure we are talking about in this bill also builds on assistance to people who pay provisional tax by virtue of the reduction of the uplift factor from eight per cent to six per cent. The government has also delivered to older Australians, including self-funded retirees, its promises to keep Medicare and bulk-billing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I need to say, in deference to my own constituents, that I believe we could go further. And I hope that the government will go further in a number of these ways. I think that what we did in the budget in a very difficult situation, facing as we did that huge black hole, was deliver on our election promises and set a direction. One clear direction <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> we set was to recognise the plight of people who had provided for their own retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that we will go further in the future. There are still inequities in the system for independent retirees. Unless they are part&hyphen;pensioners, for example, they do not receive a health care card. Like pensioners, as older Australians, independent retirees spend a lot on health care. Assuming that a couple will shortly be having to pay $20 to have a prescription filled, you could imagine that for an older couple that could easily cost up to $1,000 a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ought to say in fairness that, ironically, this legislation also raises the existing threshold for the medical expenses rebate from $1,000 to $1,500&mdash;it is actually $1,430 this year&mdash;and the medical expenses over the threshold qualify for a rebate of 20c in the dollar. The net effect of that&mdash;at least by my rough calculations&mdash;is that it will not have a great impact and certainly, by virtue of this measure that is being introduced into legislation tonight and the package of other benefits, there are enormous net gains for independent retirees that have been provided by this government since it was elected in delivering its election promises to that group of people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the moment, independent retirees are having to cope with lower incomes which result from falling interest rates. I often have people in that group complaining about falling interest rates. Of course, the answer, which they understand because they are intelligent people, is that lower interest rates are of substantial benefit to most people but, while interest rates are falling, those on fixed incomes from their investments are likely to receive lower incomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The present system of asset and income testing seems to me to still be inadequate. We have spent a lot of time looking at asset and income testing. The previous government fiddled around with it. We have made some further adjustments to it, but it still remains, in my view, full of anomalies and inequities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Deeming was apparently part of the solution, but I think it is becoming, as I thought it would, part of the problem, as deeming rates are shown to be ad hoc and inflexible. There will always be an argument about what <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7002"> the deeming rates ought to be, and that is why that system is ultimately flawed, in my view. It may be simpler&mdash;and that is the great argument for it&mdash;but in the end it is not necessarily fairer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tonight I have with me a couple of submissions that I read today, including one from the National Seniors Association. Its submission to the Wallis inquiry showed that there are within the current system serious disincentives for older people to change their housing arrangements, for example. Often, people living in an expensive older home cannot afford to maintain it but they are not prepared to take the risk of selling up and moving into much more suitable accommodation because of the possible loss of part&hyphen;pension&mdash;and not only loss of part&hyphen;pension but often, more importantly, the loss of the fringe benefits such as the health care card which go with that part&hyphen;pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ought to also put on the record, while we are on the subject of the treatment of independent retirees, what I think is an important contribution to the debate made by the Institute of Actuaries of Australia. They have recently prepared a paper entitled `A better retirement strategy for Australia'. I think this document has a lot to commend it. I hope that honourable members on both sides will read it and perhaps it will form the basis for some debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Everyone would agree that the primary objective for retirement income policy would be that people should be able to look forward to their retirement with a secure and adequate level of income. That expectation has not been met in recent years and is still not being met in many respects. There is still a degree of uncertainty, insecurity and inadequacy. The Institute of Actuaries of Australia paper addresses the basic conflict which is inherent in the present system, which discourages savings because of the effect it has on the entitlement to the pension and associated benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the debate really needs to go on. I am pleased and proud that, in relation to the treatment of retirement incomes, the government has delivered on its election promises in this legislation to that group of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people that the former government ignored for so long: self&hyphen;funded or independent retirees.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Australia is to reduce its unemployment rate, it must sustain economic growth at over four per cent per annum. The last three years when Labor was in office showed what could be achieved when we had economic growth averaging 4.2 per cent per annum and employment growth averaging three per cent per annum.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Through that combination, we saw unemployment fall from 11 per cent to 8.1 per cent&mdash;with the five per cent target for the turn of the century achievable. In contrast to that, this government forecasts economic growth at 3&half; per cent and employment growth of only two per cent. And already we are seeing the results: unemployment back up to 8.8 per cent and trend unemployment rising.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are to sustain economic growth above the four per cent which is necessary to get unemployment down, we need to develop industries which are committed to expanding the nation's net exports. We must get away from relying just on a commodity based export mentality to doing more to those commodities by value adding them&mdash;by combining our natural resource and our human resource potential far better. And if we are to make this connection, it requires innovation and support for clever applications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we want our future generations to be able to get more interesting and better paid jobs, we also have to encourage innovative adaptation and growth in new goods and services produced here in Australia for a world market. To achieve that, we need a partnership between government and industry. We need a more interventionist industry policy&mdash;not a dead hand of government sort of intervention but a partnership that is driven by industry, not by Canberra. We need a policy that is based not on raising tariffs and propping up poor performers&mdash;that is what the National Party wants&mdash;but on supporting industries and firms that embrace best practice and are internationally competitive. It is not picking winners; it is government giving support and backing to those industries and firms committed to the challenge, which are efficient but <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7003"> which, for various reasons, have difficulty competing or getting into overseas markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> One area that government must give priority to is improving our research and development effort. It is in that context that I want to address my remarks in this debate on Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3). Expanding our support for research and development must be an integral part of our industry policy. We must link our proven track record in strategic research to further developing our resource base and the emerging high value&hyphen;added growth industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has traditionally been a strong commitment to research and development by the public sector in Australia but a very poor commitment by the private sector. That is why Labor produced a suite of policies to encourage growth in private sector research and development. The first policy was the 150 per cent research and development tax concession, a straight tax deduction, providing an up-front incentive to help overcome the risks involved in getting research off the ground and recognising the long lead time associated with commercialisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also had a second string in the bow: syndication for research and development to encourage the clustering of firms by providing the opportunity for projects too big or too risky for any one company to be undertaken by a group of companies, also recognising that many companies just starting out could not have effective claims on the 150 per cent tax concession in any meaningful sense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third string in the bow was the government grants scheme. This approach by Labor achieved significant results:  a doubling of business investment in research and development in just eight years and the second highest growth rate in research and development by the private sector of all OECD countries. A recent <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> article concluded: </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The policies introduced in the 1980s to kick start private research and development have been highly successful.</PARA>
<PARA>Even the Industry Commission reached the same conclusion last year when it recommended that the concession be retained at 150 per cent. It stated that the removal of the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> concession at that rate would reduce the nation's gross domestic product.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Those achievements are now being put in jeopardy by this bill which, amongst other things, reduces the research and development tax concession from 150 to 125 per cent and abolishes research and development syndication&mdash;both massive broken promises because the coalition did not tell Australian industry that these changes would be introduced in the first budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, the government is now cutting $2.2 billion from research and development spending and replacing it with a paltry $340 million program of grants, the as yet undefined START scheme. Apart from this massive reduction in support, the problem with this approach is it is putting all of its eggs in the grants basket. It is too limiting; it will not be enough on its own to continue to promote the growth of research and development by the private sector that we have experienced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) has shown yet again that he simply will not stand up for industry. His pathetic defence was that it could have been worse: that Treasury wanted to cut the 150 per cent tax concession to 100 per cent and that industry should be thankful for retaining it at 125 per cent. We also have the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr McGauran) admitting that the cut to 125 per cent from 150 per cent was the price for retaining the diesel fuel rebate and, with that, bolstering Tim Fischer's leadership of the National Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have the Treasurer (Mr Costello) saying that the cut from 150 per cent to 125 per cent is like paying a parking fine. He does not even attempt to justify the massive cuts to research and development assistance; he simply makes the claim that those companies using the tax concession are `rorters'. However, none of the examples put by the government to justify abolishing the syndication scheme has been shown to have rorted it. You cannot stop applications of dubious quality being made, but you can ensure through the guidelines that they do not get up. Yet the government of today opposed in the Senate <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7004"> when it was in opposition last year our tightening up of the guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have a government without commitment, driven by Treasury in pursuit of the budget bottom line regardless of the consequences. The consequences of this measure are horrendous. The government ignores the fact that research and development can travel. There is already plenty of evidence that it will travel. In a recent Deloitte's survey, 51 per cent of companies indicated that they would consider moving their research and development operations to countries like Malaysia and Singapore, which offer a 200 per cent research and development concession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia does not adopt these policies in isolation. Like the industry bounties, which the government has also abolished, we introduced them to enable our companies to compete with other countries that have those measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) himself in today's newspaper has acknowledged in the lead-up to discussions that are being held with the US President that there is no such thing as a level playing field. But his government decision to slash research and development assistance in this way will tilt it even further against us, putting many companies out of the game. The result will be the exporting of innovative Australian research and the job opportunities that go with it. The only thing that we will be exporting is jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, a joint Price Waterhouse and Australian Industry Research Group survey of 250 companies revealed that more than half the companies expect to reduce their investment in research and development by 20 per cent or more, or will reorganise how their research and development is done, such as by moving it offshore. We are opposing the provisions in this bill which implement these measures&mdash;that is, items 1 to 14 and items 71 to 73 of schedule 4. I will be moving amendments in relation to these measures and another matter that I want to come to at the conclusion of my remarks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Other items in schedule 4 have the effect of tightening up on eligibility for the 150 per cent research and development tax concession. These include the changes to R&amp;D related <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> interest expenditure, feedstock, core technology, pilot plant and the definition of eligible research and development activity. We do not oppose these measures; in fact, we tightened up on eligibility for the 150 per cent concession from time to time when we were in government. However, the opposition does reserve its right to oppose individual changes which the Senate committee process shows have particularly negative impacts on business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> We oppose short-sighted decisions to cut the research and development tax concession from 150 per cent to 125 per cent and we also oppose the scrapping of research and development syndication. We do support measures to overcome so-called rorting where it is shown to exist, but we do not support the abolition of syndication as such&mdash;that is equivalent to throwing the baby out with the bath water&mdash;and we will vigorously oppose the exporting of ideas and jobs overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> We also oppose the retrospective impact of the decision to end research and development syndication. The Senate has recently rejected the retrospective approach in its consideration of the so-called gravedigging provisions of the Industry Research and Development Amendment Bill 1996. At least 46 syndicate proposals were in the pipeline when the Treasurer and the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism announced that they were ending the syndication scheme. But transitional provisions in this bill will prevent those 46 proposals from proceeding to the stage of final consideration for approval by the Industrial Research and Development Board. That is retrospective, and it is another reason why we will oppose the decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> These provisions also ignore the fact that the research and development board has sat on many project applications, giving no approvals for many months&mdash;in other words, there is a question about process in the lead-up to what became the decision of the government&mdash;with the result that some companies, like Orbital Engine Corporation in Perth, have commenced legal action against the board. They say that they have had enough of the uncertainty. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7005">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not only unfair to the companies involved but also inconsistent with the coalition's previous stance on retrospectivity. They opposed other tightening measures that we proposed in the 1995 budget. For all these reasons, we have supported the reference of this bill to the Senate committee. It will enable those in industry, those whom the Treasurer is fond of calling `the recipients of business welfare', to come out and demonstrate the impact that these decisions will have, as they have done in force in relation to the scrapping of the bounties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We want to demonstrate the difference between submitting applications for research and development syndicates and having them approved and to prove that they are not rorters, and we will use the process to achieve that. We also want to show that these cuts will result in valuable research and development activity being driven overseas along with export, investment and employment opportunities for Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The other thing I want to turn to is the provisions in this bill to change the tax treatment for cooperatives&mdash;that is, items 17 and 18 in schedule 1 of the bill which remove the tax deduction cooperatives have long been able to claim for government loans used to purchase assets. We do this because it is yet another kick in the teeth for regional Australia by this government&mdash;a government that has the National Party Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fisher) unable to stand up for his constituency in regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Presently, capital debt incurred by cooperatives is not taxed if it is borrowed from a government entity. However, this provision removes that tax free status. It therefore taxes every future repayment of debt incurred by cooperatives to purchase assets for the expansion of their business. It is a minimal measure in terms of budget savings achieved&mdash;$12 million over three years. But understand the effect of it. We have National Party members frequently coming into this place complaining about the crippling effects of rural debt, yet they have supported this measure which can only worsen that situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Cooperatives, whose members are overwhelmingly farmers, will now have to pay a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> new tax on debt and their future viability is threatened by this measure. Yet, without them, there will be no investment in many regional centres. This measure is not just an attack on efforts to encourage value adding in our primary production industries; it will also hit regional Australia hard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Queensland cooperatives such as the Golden Circle Cannery in Brisbane supporting the north coast pineapple growing industry, the Mackay Sugar Mills and dairy cooperatives operating in the Atherton Tablelands, Caboolture, Toowoomba and Ipswich are just some of those that will be hit. Another example is United Milk in Tasmania&mdash;the largest cooperative in that state with over $170 million in sales last year, employing almost 400 people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Transitional arrangements in the bill will shield some cooperatives from the removal of the tax deduction and a government amendment will assist some others. But what about those cooperatives that do not qualify under the transitional provisions? Many of them will have made plans for expansion on the basis of the deduction continuing, although not in the formal sense required by the government amendment. The amendment and transitional provisions are just tinkering with what amounts to a bad policy decision, ill&hyphen;considered, not thought through and taken without consultation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So Labor opposes the provisions in this bill which amount to a massive attack on our national research effort because of the stifling effect the government's approach will have on innovative research in Australia and the commercialisation of that research and because it is yet further evidence of the government's failure to produce and implement an industry policy for Australia's future. We will also oppose the attack on regional Australia, evident in the removal of the tax deduction for cooperatives. We will be looking with interest to see whether the government members representing rural seats, particularly those in the National Party, will support us on this measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I foreshadow amendments to be moved by Labor in consideration in detail of this bill. These amendments have been circulated to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7006"> the House. The effect of these amendments is to ensure the deletion of the provisions in the bill on those items which I have indicated we oppose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition is taking positions on other aspects of this legislation. But the two items that I particularly want to focus upon are the cuts to research and development and the impact and restraining influence on the ability of cooperatives to grow. Both are bad decisions for the constituencies concerned, but they are bad decisions for the nation and they are bad decisions because they will only see growth restrained rather than improved. We will not get unemployment down in this country unless we get faster economic growth and that is why we oppose the provision. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The previous speaker, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), said a number of things with which I very strongly agree. I gave a commitment, which I cannot get out of, for tomorrow night before I knew the House would be sitting. However, I formally advise the House that if this Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) is voted upon either prior to or after that commitment then I will most certainly vote against it. I do not take that decision lightly. However, it cuts at the very heart of the reason why I passed up opportunities and left the very prominent frontbench position I held in the Queensland parliament to come to the federal arena. Constantly&mdash;daily, weekly and monthly&mdash;I could see the Australian economy collapsing. Virtually not a month went by without some devastating blow to the vital underpinning of the Australian economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tonight we have heard reference to McEwenism&mdash;a word that is strongly abroad these days. Many newspapers and media outlets in Australia are reflecting upon the figures for the McEwen era. For those people in this place who decry the McEwen policies, it is unfortunate that history records things in writing. Going through the performance indicators for the McEwen era and the last 13 but, arguably, 15 or 16 years, the hypocrisy of the Australian Labor Party strikes me as more than passing strange, as they presided over the implementation of the greatest <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> economic rationalism&mdash;ideologically driven policies&mdash;which has continued for over a decade. I will reflect upon how successful the policies of the super&hyphen;dries&mdash;the economic rationalists, the level playing field people in this place&mdash;have been compared with the unapologetically interventionist policies of the McEwenists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come from Queensland where the Bjelke&hyphen;Petersen years saw that state rise to a level of economic dominance that could not have been dreamt of when Bjelke&hyphen;Petersen was appointed Premier. And he followed the same sorts of policies as John McEwen, who was a very similar person. For the benefit of all those wonderful idealogues in this place who think they have all the answers, let us look at the record. Before I read out the record to this place, if you go back and pick up my speeches, you will find that at one time I was an economic rationalist and a super&hyphen;dry. But I assessed how each of those decisions worked out on the ground and I rapidly came to the conclusion that the Australian nation was embarking upon a disastrous road.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at those figures which changed my mind. I find it very difficult to understand how anyone could see these figures and not have their minds changed in exactly the same way. Let me choose the first and most devastating figure of unemployment. In 1972, the last year of the McEwen era, the average rate of unemployment for the 12 months prior to that period was 2.2 per cent. In 1991, it was 10.5 per cent and in 1996 it is arguably 8.8 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Referring to the work of John Langmore, the ALP member in this place, Dr Kemp and John Quiggan, who won the Academy of Science prize, all three people quote 17 per cent as the real comparable unemployment figure. So we are comparing the great economic rationalist policies that delivered unemployment levels of 17 per cent with the unemployment level of 2.2 per cent in 1972.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The balance of payments in 1972 was a surplus. We now say `current account deficit' as one word, but in 1972 it was a current account surplus of $403 million. The current account deficit in 1991 was over $12,000 <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7007"> million, and the current account deficit for 1996 was $20,259 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us turn to interest paid on foreign debt. It would be far more startling if I used the actual debt figure, but the figure for interest on foreign debt is what we have to meet out of our taxes and our incomes every year. The interest on foreign debt in 1972&mdash;these are non-constant figures&mdash;was $202 million. In 1991, it was $14,800 million. In 1996, it was $12,800 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to bankruptcies. I do not think there is any clearer indicator of the state of the economy than the bankruptcies and unemployment figures. Bankruptcies in 1972 totalled 2,648. In 1991, they totalled 13,091. In 1996, we hit the all-time record for Australia of 17,340 bankruptcies&mdash;17,340 versus 2,648.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tax revenue in 1972, with this great interventionist policy decried in part by the previous speaker&mdash;in part he praised it, I must admit in all fairness to him&mdash;needed for these handouts, picking winners and helping and looking after all these people was $8.9 thousand million. In 1991, tax revenue was $97.9 thousand million. In 1996, it was $116,000 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interest rates in 1972 were seven per cent. In actual fact, the average for the four years rising from 1972 was only five per cent. In 1991 they were 15.5 per cent, and in 1996 they were 10.5 per cent. The value of the Australian dollar in 1972 was $1.28 and rising. In 1991, it had collapsed to 76c, and it now stands at around 79c. It took 384 Japanese yen to buy an Australian dollar in 1972. Now it takes only 86 Japanese yen. In 1991, it took 95 Japanese yen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think one of the most relevant figures is the change in real terms&mdash;I emphasise `real terms'&mdash;in average weekly earnings over the 10 years to 1972: a rise of 42.9 per cent. The average working man in Australia was fairing tremendously well under the policies of John McEwen, with a rise of 42.9 per cent. For the 10 years to 1991 it was 2.7 per cent. By 1996 it had fallen to minus 1.2 per cent. If you add to that figure of minus 1.2 per cent the tax bite&mdash;remember that taxes have increased 300 per cent over the last 12 years&mdash;we are <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> looking at a diminution of some 25 per cent in real income for average weekly wage earners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me move on. I think this bill is very much in the mould of the McEwen era. It is very good to have with us this evening the member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) in the mould of his father, who was first lieutenant and then leader and the person who was responsible for carrying on those policies which were so tremendously effective in delivering a rich and great country to us all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I particularly prefer to the greatest earner for the Australian economy, the wool industry. One-tenth of our entire earnings came from that one commodity. Thanks to the efforts of Doug Anthony in this place and the continuation of those policies of interventionism, if you like, we found that the price of wool rose some 400 per cent, arguably 600 per cent, in the two or three years after he introduced the price scheme. In the two or three years after the removal of the price scheme, the removal of interventionism, we saw the price collapse, fall clean in half, from around 900c a kilo down to around 380c to 390c a kilo.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous speaker, the member for Hotham, said the National Party believes in tariffs and putting up protective barriers and not being scared to involve ourselves in the outside economies of the world. John McEwen spoke only ever in terms of nursery tariffs. They were there for a period to allow new businesses to arise, but today there are two very good reasons for their continued existence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of them is that every other country in the world enjoys huge tariff protection. In the sugar industry, which I think is the fifth or sixth biggest export earning industry for this nation, we compete in the world market against Europe. The last time I looked they were the biggest sugar exporters in the world. I think the figures were revised two years ago. At that time they enjoyed a tariff support system from the European Community of 192 per cent. It is extremely hard to compete against a 30 to 40 per cent subsidy or tariff level. To compete against 192 per cent is nigh on impossible.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7008">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the reason why, if you want to play on a level playing field and you want to be fair dinkum, if they have got a 192 per cent subsidy and they are our biggest competitor in the world, you have to provide something equivalent for our producers or they will simply be crushed and crucified by that sort of competition. This is not a figure that I have plucked out of the air. I am quoting from page 1072 of a 1990 report to the President of the United States on tariff and tariff equivalents on a series of primary industry commodity products throughout the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The banana industry is an excellent example. We are competing against people in Central America who work for $2.60 a day. If you want to have a level playing field, then our workers work for $2.60 a day or we have to close down the banana industry, which is worth $300 million a year to the Australian economy. There is no in&hyphen;between; either you go down to those slave wage levels or you close down the industry here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can quote many other examples of what I am talking about. The way in which these people went about delivering the intervention that was so desperately needed for us to stay alive in the international marketplace was through things like the AIDC, the PIBA&mdash;money for water, the building of dams throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will quote one figure in that regard. In Queensland, we have moved to a user&hyphen;pays principle&mdash;some would argue, imposed upon us by the federal government&mdash;which takes us to $30 a megalitre for water. The biggest agricultural state in the world apart from Queensland and New South Wales, I would argue, is the state of California. Water charges in California on the last occasion I looked were $3.90 a megalitre. Clearly, the government there builds the dams and does not charge the dams out to the farmers, which was the way in which we operated in this country until very, very recently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, you can say that these people are being subsidised, but if you do not do it you will not have any agriculture taking place in this country. That is exactly what is happening today. This country has lost 40 per cent of its sheep herd, its biggest export <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> earning item throughout our history. It was the biggest export earning item in 1988, when this House removed the reserve price scheme for wool. To those who say that it was going to happen anyway, I say that it is very funny that when the reserve price scheme was introduced the price went up by 400 or 500 per cent; when the reserve price scheme was removed it dropped clean in half. Coincidence!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to government contracts, I was very surprised to find out the other day that 24 per cent of the cars traded in Australia are now being traded to governmental or semi&hyphen;governmental bodies. So a simple administrative decision to buy all Australian made motor cars will be of absolutely tremendous benefit to the motor vehicle building industry in Australia. There are many other analogies that I can draw to your attention, Mr Deputy Speaker.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer to Chalmers Johnson's famous book on the Japanese economy. The computer company IBM has never won a major contract in Japan, yet outside Japan not a single Japanese operator has ever won a contract in competition against IBM. So these are all devices that are used. I have seen them used and I have used them myself in the Queensland government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I applaud some of the other outstanding examples, such as Doug Anthony's saving of the wool industry in Australia, which delivered an extra $2,000 million or $3,000 million a year into the Australian economy because of his aggressive marketing approach. The other great example was former Senator Button's rescue and re&hyphen;creation, if you like, of the Australian steel industry&mdash;the most inefficient industry that you would probably have found in the world. One worker in the car industry in Australia produced 80 tonnes of steel, one worker in South Korea produced 260 tonnes of steel and one worker in the Kaohsiung plant in Taiwan produced 600 tonnes of steel a year. You could not get anything much more ineffective, competition wise, than that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A very large grant of money was given by the federal government to BHP&mdash;some will argue that it was $300 million; some will <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7009"> argue that it was $1,000 million&mdash;on condition that they invest $4,000 million. The industry was restructured and, even though it is now in struggling times again, for 12 or 13 years it was internationally competitive. That was a terrific achievement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn back to the specific proposal before the House tonight with regard to section 121C. The Mossman mill is in a very difficult position. You have to be big if you want to be a successful and efficiently operating sugar mill. They are going to have to expand because they are in a burgeoning tourism area and the cane areas are closing down and being subdivided. That is similarly the case with a number of other mills. But if they want to expand, as they do, they have a very suitable area in which to expand but it will cost them a lot of money&mdash;tens of millions of dollars. That is similarly the case with the South Johnston mill, the Tully mill and the Ravenshoe proposal&mdash;and I hope that the Queensland government is intending to build a big dam at Ravenshoe&mdash;that will produce 2&half; million tonnes of cane a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a classic example at Ingham. CSR point blank refuses to expand its milling capacity at Ingham. So, if we want to grow any more sugarcane at Ingham, we simply have to build a farmer owned mill because there is nobody else out there who will build a mill for us. There are farmers who want to expand and produce an extra million tonnes of cane a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you add all of that together, that is 5.4 million tonnes of cane which we want to grow. That will be a great addition to the Australian economy. It seems to me that we have general principles here but we never climb to the coalface to look at reality. If you are a cooperative, it is very difficult to raise money. You cannot float a share fund because legislatively you are not allowed to. You are a cooperative; you are a farmer owned operation. It is very difficult to borrow money from the banks because the banks, for obvious reasons, find it difficult to foreclose on a cooperative. So it is very difficult for them to raise money. That is the reason why the clause was put there in the first place and that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is why successive governments since 1930 have left it there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why a number of us, particularly in the National Party, feel so very strongly that the clause must be left there. If the clause is removed, those people will not be able to raise finance, and if they cannot raise that finance then that expansion will not take place. If that expansion does not take place, then Australia will lose $270 million a year in extra export earnings. The stupidity of these decisions is happening continually in this place. Existing industries will collapse as well because they will be inefficient. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a research driven government, but unfortunately it is the research which comes from the public opinion poll. It is the research which comes from the focus group. It is the research which gives the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) his famous one-liners in this House. It is not the kind of research which provides for a sound industrial and technological base for this country into the future. It is not the kind of research on which good science is based. It is not the kind of research which will deliver for Australia the innovation and growth in our marketplaces that we so desperately need.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I am happy to report that it is a research driven government, I very much regret that it is the wrong kind of research. It is the kind of research we do not need in this country which will provide for the good science and innovation which we have always had in the past. Australia has a very famous track record throughout the world in its mining industries, its agricultural industries, its manufacturing and its defence science for producing sound innovation and sound research and development work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have many historical precedents on which we can rely in terms of producing Australia's high standards of innovation and science. But we are always going to need that spark of discovery, that spark of innovation. We are always going to need the initial one-off discovery that breaks new ground if we are to keep on moving in the high&hyphen;tech era of the 1990s and the 21st century. In the past, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7010"> breakthroughs were slower. The pace of change was much slower. World trade was minimal. We could base our innovation on individual effort.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look back in history in Australia you will see that our agricultural innovations&mdash;for example, the stump-jump plough&mdash;were based on the inspirational spark of an individual who had a clear problem which needed to be solved in the context of their own farm, industry or whatever. They were able to produce that innovation and it spread slowly throughout society. Years, in fact, were allowed for these things to develop. But we do not have that kind of time scale now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Modern society requires a much greater effort on our part, a coordinated and sustained effort in research and development to produce the kind of innovation and pace of change which modern society demands. Research also carries with it substantial costs. It is not always possible for people to make this level of commitment privately and individually in the way in which they could in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Industry also has conflicting demands for immediate results and for research driven by commercial goals. That is perfectly understandable in the context of industry. They have shareholders to account to, they have an annual general meeting coming up within a few months and they have the share market judging their performance on a daily, even a minute&hyphen;by&hyphen;minute, basis. Industry needs to respond to those imperatives of the short-term profit motive. But that may not always be in the long-term national interests of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Government commitment through the taxpayers is necessary, indeed essential, to drive that initial spark of innovation and to ensure that resources are available for the long term for those forward&hyphen;looking, basic research projects which have no immediate commercial return. That is what we have always used organisations like CSIRO for. That is what our universities have always done in the past. Industry has contributed to that process, but perhaps not on the level that is essential if they are to reap the full returns of this and if Australia is to get the full industrial research and development benefit.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two good examples of that which are very relevant and which I would like to share with the House. For example, 1996 is the 50th anniversary of the birth of ENIAC, which was the world's first programmable computer, built for very limited strategic purposes during the Second World War. It was initially used to calculate naval artillery ranges, the distance the shell would travel from a given gun. Subsequently, it was used for many thousands of calculations in developing atomic weapons during World War II.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This particular device had substantially less computing power than my current wristwatch, which I bought for some $30, and which is probably disposable. The computer chip in that wristwatch is substantially more powerful than that first programmable computer developed 50 years ago. ENIAC weighed some 30 tons. I can assure you that my wristwatch does not weigh 30 tons, so you can get some idea of the speed and innovation in the computer industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ideas about the future of computing were very limited in those days. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Popular Mechanics</EMPHASIS> magazine of the day speculated that one day we may have computers that weighed even less than 1.5 tons. When confronted with this idea, the CEO of IBM, which was then a business machine corporation which had never heard of computers, foresaw that the world might have a global market of perhaps five computers one day. It just shows how dangerous it is to make predictions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This all came from a modest US government grant for university research. ENIAC came about as a result of a very modest grant from the US government to Penn State University. They had no prospect of future commercial return from this investment and no industry would have supported that level of commitment to the development of a computer back in 1946.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other very important example which is shaping our society even as we speak is the development of the internet. The internet was developed back in 1969, again based on a US government grant to establish a computer network that would be redundant and fail&hyphen;safe in the event of nuclear war and which would <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7011"> allow the research communities to talk to the military community to ensure that the research effort of the time was sustained even in the face of attack. No-one at the time ever imagined that that network would evolve into the internet that we know today. The very small grant which helped to establish that in the first place and to sustain it through its development at times when it had no commercial return and when it had no relevance to society day by day again came from government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is that spark of innovation which those government grants fostered at the time in the development of the first programmable computer and the development of the internet and finally in the development the world wide web browser that now makes the internet user friendly in a way that even members of parliament and school students can use them with great effect these days. That all came from initial government grants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Internet and the whole computing environment change the very way in which we perceive society. Communication on a distributed intelligence basis has to be the new metaphor for our society. As Vice&hyphen;President Al Gore has recently pointed out, we are no longer faced with a hierarchical top&hyphen;down imposition of ideas but rather a distributed intelligence network which ensures that everyone can make a contribution through their own individual effort to society as a whole. Even our very democracy is underpinned by this kind of concept but we would not have got there without the commitment of governments and taxpayers in funding research with a very narrow base and with no immediate prospect of any substantial pay back&mdash;and certainly with no immediate commercial relevance which industry would have supported at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Industry is constrained in the way they do things. They are required to do more with less. They adopt a design&mdash;they either produce it themselves or they buy it from outside&mdash;they provide incremental improvements to that design in response to customer demands and they continually find ways of making more of that design for less and less cost. That is the way they drive their bottom line and maximise their profit. Industry, of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> course, is reasonably constrained to act in that way. That is quite reasonable in the context of our current industrial age understanding but the information age into which this country is rapidly moving demands a whole new way of thinking and it provides the tools to do it with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the concept of distributed intelligence and information age technology is fundamentally underlined by sustained research, development and innovation. That research and development sustains the very innovation itself and ensures that we will constantly be in a position of moving forward and regenerating our ideas base, providing a new way of ensuring wealth and jobs in this country. But it also demands a number of other things if you examine this model of distributed intelligence which ensures that our policies must be radically different from those this government is promulgating in its budget and this bill tonight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to support our universities. We need to support access to those universities and the HECS changes in the recent budget send all the wrong messages to students. They send all the wrong messages particularly to science and engineering students whom we desperately need in this country to take on board the kind of research and development and innovation effort we will need in the future. This government's attack on the university sector to the extent of some $800 million in the recent budget will ensure that only the wealthy can gain access to our universities and it will fundamentally undermine the research and development efforts of our universities, which have always been so critical in the past&mdash;the research of CSIRO, AIMS and ANSTO, the other public sector organisations which have served this country so well in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, one of the greatest frauds of the 1996 budget was the statement by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) on budget night that he had provided an extra $115 million to CSIRO. That, indeed, was one of the greatest frauds because the reality over the next four years&mdash;when you examine the pluses and minuses in the CSIRO's budgets and the commitments to repay funding to this government which the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7012"> government has forced on the CSIRO&mdash;is that that famous organisation will be some $4 million to $10 million worse off at the end of the four&hyphen;year funding period than it was before the budget. That is some contrast to the $115 million which the Treasurer promised them in additional funding. In fact it is a $4 million to $10 million decrease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about the Australian Research Council and the NHMRC, which also provided substantial funding over many years to our universities and our independent researchers in this country? The ratio of grants approved in that area is declining. We can expect under this government that it will decline even further. What kind of message are school students in science and technology getting from this government when they see cutbacks in funding to universities and when they see cutbacks in research and development? Any students contemplating science, engineering or technological careers must surely learn something from this government and this budget; and that is that they are not interested in science and technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen cutbacks in industry training through the gutting of the Working Nation program. Worst of all&mdash;and tonight's legislation confronts this directly&mdash;we have seen the dramatic reduction in R&amp;D tax concessions from 150 per cent to 125 per cent, and an end to syndication. Studies have clearly shown the direct link between research and development and innovation. It is that kind of direct link which will ensure the dramatic cut in research and development, which this legislation will bring about, and will ensure a significant and equally dramatic reduction in innovation and subsequent job creation in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> We had a very poor record of business sector investment in R&amp;D prior to the innovative changes which the former Labor government introduced in the 1980s but, during the 1980s, following the introduction of those incentives to stimulate research and development in business we saw significant changes and improvements in business commitment to research and development. Those studies that have been conducted by the Industry Commission, the Bureau of Industry Economics and others all show that those taxation incen tives and syndication were very good at improving business research and development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Innovation is directly linked to that research and development. We have seen the benefit of that in the rapid growth of elaborately transformed manufactures over the last decade. That has been our best growing sector, something of the order of 18 per cent per year. That, of course, has driven job growth, exports and wealth creation in this country in a way nothing else could. Conversely, the cutting of those incentives and tax concessions will have an equally dramatic reverse effect on all the good that has gone before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When confronted by the benefits of this cycle of research, investment, innovation, job creation, wealth creation, allowing more funds to be invested back in research, development and innovation&mdash;what does this government do? It attacks the very basis of that cycle and undermines the very basis of the sustained innovation we have had and, therefore, cuts all the potential for job creation in this country, going against the very tests which this government has set itself for new policy: that it must create jobs; it must create exports. The test enunciated by the Prime Minister is destroyed by the very policy we are expected to vote on in this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recent surveys by accounting firms Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu and Price Waterhouse and the bureau have shown only too clearly that industry in this country will withdraw investment from R&amp;D. In some cases, they will simply withdraw the investment; in other cases, they will take that investment offshore because, contrary to the expectations of the Treasurer and the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr McGauran) and the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore), countries like Malaysia and Singapore offer very substantial research and development tax concessions, and companies are gradually becoming aware of that. The surveys show that, as they do so, they will take their investments offshore and Australia will lose out on that kind of investment which is so essential to our future economic growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many companies are not yet even aware of those overseas concessions. The surveys reveal that, as they become aware of them, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7013"> they will shift that investment offshore and we will be denied access to that cycle of investment, innovation, research and development, and job growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The research and development concessions which are in place up until this legislation comes into effect also have the effect of speeding up research and development in companies, allowing them to get to market faster. One of the most critical things you can do to assist a company in the modern technological era in which we live is to provide them with a mechanism for getting their product to market faster. Product life cycles these days are dramatically foreshortened. There is no question that, if you can get your product to market earlier, you will have much greater success, much greater return. One of the best ways of doing that is to enhance your R&amp;D effort.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What have this government done? They have undermined the research and development effort of companies, thereby increasing the time it will take them to get their product to market and thereby undercutting the very basis of the investment, job growth and export led recovery of the 1980s and 1990s. They have also attacked the export facilitation processes through the abolition of the DIFF scheme and by their capping of EMDG. All of those things go a long way towards further undermining the ability of companies to export.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the other sectors of this industry which is important to touch on prior to concluding is the information technology industry. This industry is vitally important to the information age. It is the very fundamental on which the information age is based. It is part of the new infrastructure which Australian society and industry will need to compete in the 21st century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is undermining the information technology industry in a number of very important ways. It firstly promised as a pre&hyphen;election commitment, as if this was something to be proud of, that it would cut $1 billion out of government expenditure on IT. That severely threatens the domestic infrastructure base of the IT industry. In the recent budget, the government imposed a freeze on <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> IT expenditure until a cabinet decision early in the new year which will set a new standard for government information technology but which, I suspect, will turn a lot of that over to overseas multinational companies, again freezing out the domestic industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The end of the computer bounty, which is also in legislation before this House, will have a significant impact on our domestic information technology base. The reduction in research and development concessions, which is before the House, will also undermine the information technology industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, this government have specially targeted the IT industry, the very basis of the information age, the very basis of moving into the 21st century, and the basis for investment in job growth and in innovation, research and development. They are undermining that industry in so many ways that it is surprising that people are not moving out of it in droves. Unfortunately, their multi&hyphen;pronged attack on that industry will have the effect of destroying our domestic base just when we are importing more and still exporting more at the moment&mdash;at least until this government has its way&mdash;but the deficit between what we import and export on IT and telecommunications is growing at a frightening rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, Australia has a substantial deficit in the information technology and telecommunications areas. I am afraid that all of the steps which this government are taking will contribute towards widening that deficit, when the government should be working towards improving the domestic base and when they should be working towards strengthening information technology industries, not only as a basis for an important domestic and export industry in itself but as the very basis on which society, industry and education will move into the 21st century. They are undermining that vital infrastructure day after day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is disastrous for our industry. It is disastrous for our science. It is disastrous for Australia's future. It fails the government's own policy tests on job creation and innovation. The $2 billion cut which we see in R&amp;D as a result of this bill is to be replaced by only a very modest scheme which will have <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7014"> nothing like the impact. It is Canberra attempting to pick winners instead of allowing the community to pick winners. It is depriving Australia of a vital infrastructure of research and development and of innovation and job creation on which we will depend in the 21st century, but which this government shows no signs of understanding.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This omnibus legislation seeks to further amend the income tax act to make it fairer to sectors of the Australian community, such as the self&hyphen;funded retiree, but generally seeks to close off tax concessions which the government believes are now either overgenerous or being abused.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As usual, such measures create areas of inequity and unfairness for people who have used these tax concessions appropriately and in Australia's national interest. In this regard, I wish to mention the changes to the research and development measures and the removal of the tax exemption for the bona fide prospector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of prospectors, I welcome the government's more recent decision to extend the start&hyphen;up date for the removal of the tax concession available to prospectors until 30 November or 1 December. However, my preferred position, which I argued in party forums, was that this measure should have been applied on the same principles as the capital gains tax when it was introduced, which exempted properties acquired prior to the introduction date, or certainly some pro rata arrangement that took account of the period of ownership. That situation is the best that could be achieved. If people are making substantial amounts of money in this day and age, there are probably grounds, considering the prosperity that has applied in the mining sector in more recent times, for taxation to be paid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Overall, I regret that tax agents chose to use the R&amp;D measures for tax minimisation instead of its stated purpose as a research and development incentive, because that is a very essential need for a country like Australia with its highly educated work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is in the technology area where Australia must focus a large percentage of its effort. As <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the previous speakers have pointed out, we find it difficult to compete with very low wage nations in terms of basic manufacturing activities. Nevertheless, even those activities are becoming subject to extremely high technology and Australia is well positioned, with its highly educated work force, to deal in these areas. Tax minimisation has too frequently become the reason people get involved in certain areas. The government sets out to give incentives to other sectors that are in genuine need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that this bill now adds a further 68 pages to our income tax law. The income tax law has probably quadrupled in recent years as the tax department has tried to keep up with the various schemes that have developed when certain sectors have been given encouragement through the tax system. The government sets out to assist by giving concessions, be they research and development concessions or others, and within days the industry says, `We can do a deal for you on this.' The pity is that people are prepared to participate in schemes like that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why are people in Australia so determined to minimise their taxation, particularly their income taxation. The answer is that the incidence of income tax in Australia is far too high. The incentive to cheat is therefore of equal measure. This is a problem for our nation. Businesses that should employ cost accountants in fact employ tax accountants. Businesses that should invest in research and development to grow their businesses in fact invest in research and development because it is a tax dodge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Businesses invest in the movie industry not because Australia produces some of the great technicians of the movie industry but because it is a tax dodge. People have to have a tax dodge before they are prepared to invest. This is a problem for our nation. It comes down to one simple issue&mdash;that is, Australia's tax system is a mess and Australia as a nation resides in a tax time warp.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7015"> I will quickly review the Australian tax system as we know it. I want to look at the disincentives that our tax system, as it exists today, produces for the Australian national interest. I will start with an article that ap peared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on Monday, 23 September. It outlines that markets are losing business to Asia. It was only two or three years ago that the previous government, and it certainly had my support for this, announced that it had the intention of making Australia the financial centre for Asia. There were good reasons for trying to do that&mdash;a highly educated work force, people who knew how to run the computer systems, relatively cheap real estate and relatively cheap salaries and wages in the high technology area. They are the reasons people should invest in Australia. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The slide documented in a report commissioned by the Australian Financial Markets Association has seen the combined annual turnover of the over the counter market, the Sydney Futures Exchange and the Australian Stock Exchange fall by $1 trillion in 1995-96.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to tell us why. It is the Australian tax system that is the problem. We said to the Asian region, `Come and set up your financial service operation in our secure environment.' Then we told them that we are going to tax them on everything they do. We do not have one tax on financial services, we have three or four. We have the bank account debit tax, which is best described as the BAD tax. That was a Liberal invention. It did not take us long after that for the states to establish the FID, financial institutions duty. They have relied heavily for years on stamp duty on share transactions. It was only when the Stock Exchange did a deal with Queensland recently that they collectively managed to get some reduction in that impost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We say to the world, `Conduct your financial services in Australia, but we will tax you if you do.' They turn around and say no. Where have they gone? They have gone to Hong Kong and Singapore where those taxes do not apply. It is pretty silly to tax people into leaving. It is pretty silly to rely so heavily on income tax that we now have a situation where people spend more time trying to cheat the system than developing their businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we have the fuel tax. Fancy taxing transport in a nation as big as Australia. Do not think we stop at that. We have another tax. We have sales tax which applies to trucks, tyres, batteries and everything else that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> has to be replaced on a vehicle. I worked out once that a transport operator pays $2,000 a week in indirect taxation for a standard semitrailer rig. We pass that on to the customers and too frequently the customers are private enterprise. Then we have such things as payroll tax. We tax people for employing people, which seems dopey.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have mentioned, we have stamp duty and all these other taxes on business. There is the company tax itself. We get terribly carried away with the problem that some big company seems not to be paying enough tax. I have always perceived a company as a piece of paper. I think it is much better that the shareholders pay the tax, but in fact we give them franked dividend rebates. We also tax land. All of this adds up to an intrusion into the efficiency of, for instance, our primary industry sector, where we see those types of taxes intruding as a cost to production of about 4 per cent net. That is more money than most people would dream of making as a profit on their turnover. So the taxation that we apply to the primary industry sector or the agricultural sector is in fact more than they would be quite happy to make as a profit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those opposite have said plenty about motor cars and their manufacture in Australia. There is no doubt that today we manufacture a good quality vehicle, and it is probable that our work force is approaching the international best standard of efficiency. But we have no chance of competing on our own soil or, more particularly, overseas. Why? Because we impose a tax burden of $800 on the manufactured cost of every Holden Commodore or Ford Falcon. What a silly thing to do. We are one of the few countries that still operate in that fashion. Taxing our productive sector is silly; there are, of course, alternatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of those alternatives is to follow the lead of just about all other OECD countries&mdash;I think I can say all OECD countries&mdash;that have a form of indirect taxation, originally known as a VAT, that does not impose that intrusive tax burden. It taxes consumption. It does not tax productivity. It rebates through so that we do not get these sorts of taxes building up on the cost of competing with the rest of the world.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7016">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thought to myself when it was first raised, when we had the Fightback proposals, that this was a measure that would help Australia, although I doubted sincerely that politically an opposition could succeed, and I told my party room accordingly. However, I have watched things develop. I have watched Australia's competitive position get worse, and I have stood up now in party forums and said that the Australian tax system has got to be reformed. You can do it however you like, but you cannot do it just in this place. It has got to be done around Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of those taxes that are impacting on industry are not federal taxes, they are state taxes, such as payroll tax. The states are hooked on it. It is such a large percentage of their revenue there is no way they can cut it back. But it is a very bad tax and today, of course, they are the owners of most of the financial institutions duties taxes, which I think Premier Kennett recently pointed out raises about $1.7 billion a year&mdash;and they cannot do without that either. They are the heroin of the states' organisations. They have no wider revenue base.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only people who can fix it, nevertheless, who can consider the entirety of the Australian tax system, are the people in this parliament. And this parliament is doing nothing about it. There is a good reason for that. We find it in all of the papers today, with the Leader of the Opposition playing stupid politics with the national interest, putting the kybosh on anybody even trying to achieve decent tax reform. They cry crocodile tears about jobs, but they do not want a tax system that makes it possible for people to compete within Australia and create those jobs. The rest of the world has got it, but Australia cannot have it. I have got to say that it will never happen unless both sides of politics stand up, recognise the fundamental problem and set out to do something about it in the national interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can have a bipartisan argument on race and a conscience vote on euthanasia. But at this point in time we have the intransigence of the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley&mdash;he is quoted here today&mdash;because there is a state election in Western Australia <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and he wants to score a silly political point and accuse Premier Court of having a secret agenda to bring in a GST; and we know that, constitutionally, he cannot do that anyway. He sees gaining this tiny political point as being more important than standing up in this parliament and saying to the government, `The Australian tax system is a mess.' It is very negative to business development and the competitive position we need to compete with these other countries. We have got to take that $800 off the cost of an Australian manufactured motor car. We have got to reduce the cost to our primary industry sector. We probably have to reduce the cost to our mining sector as things go by.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many Third World countries are now opening up. The Minister for Minerals and Energy from Mauritania visited my office the other day. They are hawking their country to Australian mining technology. They came all the way over to say, `Come join us, we'll look after you. We have not got any of these silly taxes that you put on yourself. Why waste your time in Australia?' Of course, the evidence is that a lot of those mining companies are moving out, and they are taking those opportunities. So life is going to get tougher, not easier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I heard the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) speak tonight. He and I get along all right in the corridors, but he is living in yesterday's world when he makes all those propositions about how we can turn the clock back. Let me warn the Labor Party: if they think that interventionism is what their blue collar workers want, they are barking up the wrong tree. The blue collar workers frequently do not know what that word means. What they want from you is a few other old&hyphen;fashioned values that you walked away from as you chased that so&hyphen;called middle class vote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most outrageous part of this comment is that suddenly the Leader of the Opposition says he is only opposing changes to the tax system because:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we do regard it&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>he means a GST&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">as a mechanism for hitting middle Australia. We will continue to oppose it. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7017"> </PARA>
<PARA>The last time I heard them, he and Bill Kelty were saying it was a mechanism to hit the poor in Australia, but now apparently it is a worry for the middle class. The reality is that, unless we are to have a broad based tax on consumption, which then has an effect on how many imported goods Australians might buy because in fact we would be imposing a tax there, unless we are prepared to reduce income tax to the point where it does not pay to cheat, we then will not be bringing 68 pages of tax amendments to this parliament almost fortnightly. It has become so complex nobody understands it and it has become ridiculous. The solutions are there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand why the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Treasurer (Mr Costello) do not want to be involved in this issue. They are not going to be the political chopping block for this man Beazley, who in opposition has not got the sense, has not got the commitment to the national interest to stand up and say, `Taxation in the fundamentals should be off the political agenda.' Taxation should be addressed in the national interest and the national interest demands substantial reform. It demands reform at the local government level, it demands reform at the state level and it demands reform at the federal level. All those reforms are plain to see.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite practical for Australia to basically have two or three major sources of taxation, throw all the others out and put it in a way where people can see it. We have heard for years that the three main requirements of taxation are simplicity, certainty and equity&mdash;and I always add the fourth, visibility. I do not think we should have the sorts of hidden taxes we have like sales tax and fuel tax where people do not know how much tax they are paying. The greatest discipline you can put on politicians is to ask them to write down how much tax is paid. That is why people hate income tax. That is why we have to pass all these laws to stop them abusing the process. It is too high, it is too much and they know it because that is the tax they do see.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do implore the opposition and the shadow minister, the honourable member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans), who is sitting at the table, to go back to their caucus room <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and say, `What about doing something in the national interest?' You have gone feral since you have been in opposition. You are now irrelevant consequently. Give yourself a chance.

Nevertheless, because they are the circumstances under which we legislate&mdash;it might laughingly be called that&mdash;in this chamber, I have opted to discuss just a couple of the amendments in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) and maybe take the opportunity in the detail stage to go into two or three other areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of those I want to talk about in this second reading debate is the amendment to encourage equity investments in small business. At the outset, I want to express my wholehearted support and the view that it is extremely welcome. For too long the needs of Australian small businesses have been ignored. That has been despite the fact that small and medium sized enterprises&mdash;SMEs for short&mdash;have been recognised as the potent force behind employment growth in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, the July 1996 Productivity Commission's publication entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Industry brief</EMPHASIS> found that small businesses now employ just under 50 per cent of all Australian workers. Small business has regularly articulated the difficulty it has in obtaining long-term debt finance and equity capital. However, the former government&mdash;the Labor regime&mdash;demonstrated a total lack of understanding of what small to medium sized business needed and wanted. Worse still, the previous government compounded the cashflow problems experienced by small business with the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7018"> introduction of new taxes, including the all&hyphen;permeating fringe benefits tax, along with the earlier collection of existing taxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fringe benefits tax has played its part in the erosion of the working capital base of SMEs since its introduction in 1986. It is little wonder that small business ranked the FBT regime as the factor which most affected finance in the May 1996 report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Open for business</EMPHASIS>. I would sincerely hope that the current government, having had 13 years in opposition, during which time it has had ample opportunity to determine its attitude towards small business, proves to be more responsive to that sector. I have yet to be convinced that it is, and certainly it has not reacted or acted with undue haste to the problems of the sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A report commissioned by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in 1993 found that small business is particularly vulnerable to inadequate funding at start&hyphen;up when it experiences a strong expansion phase. That report confirmed that the ability of small business to export and grow is restricted by a lack of sufficient debt and equity finance within our financial system in toto. I emphasise this point: if the provisions in this bill encourage lending institutions to make long-term investments in small businesses, it will signal a small step forward in the business sector in general and the smaller end of the market in particular.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say `if' because a similar attempt by the former Labor government proved to be an unqualified failure. I am referring to the then feted pooled development fund scheme introduced by them in 1992. I made it clear to the House in at least one speech a couple of years later that the operation of the fund was then an abject failure. It failed because it did not provide increased amounts of capital for SMEs. The incentives offered to investors did not compensate for the additional risk and lack of liquidity associated with investments in the small business sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In May of 1996, the Institute of Chartered Accountants suggested that `much could be done to promote venture and development capital through pooled development fund investment'. It proceeded to recommend that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a tax deduction be allowed for investments in PDFs. However, given the government's recent decision to reduce the tax benefit for research and development projects, it is extremely unlikely that the institute's proposal was given much consideration&mdash;and of course the proposal is not reflected in this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I simply want to reiterate this evening that SMEs' access to equity is important but the general or broad policy environment in which small business operates is the most important factor affecting the performance of small businesses. This amendment and the increase in the fringe benefits tax minor benefits exemption and the reduction in the provisional uplift factor are steps in the right direction, but they go nowhere near as far as is needed to go, despite what the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and others might suggest at question time and on other occasions. I want to restate my position that the two reforms which I just mentioned do not go anywhere near far enough in reducing unnecessary government burdens on small business and basic inequities in those two areas remain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It appears that the current proposal is likely to be more attractive to investors than the pooled development fund scheme. However, one of the criticisms levelled against the PDF program was that it was not promoted widely enough amongst investors. The coalition would do well to take note of that criticism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments will allow equity investments in small and medium&hyphen;sized enterprises to be taxed under the capital gains tax provision rather than by way of income tax. The effect of this amendment will be to bring the tax treatment of equity investment by banks and other financial intermediaries into line with those individual taxpayers who choose to make equity investments. At present, banks and the like either pay tax on the profit realised from the income of the sale of the equity investment or qualify for a deduction if a loss is incurred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In short, these investors cannot claim a deduction for expenditure at the time of making the investment. That happens to be in contrast with individual taxpayers who are now taxed under the capital gains tax provisions where only real capital gains are taxed <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7019"> on the realisation of income. The government seems to be anticipating that these lending institutions will be encouraged to invest in SMEs as a result of benefiting from the capital gains treatment&mdash;and I am inclined to agree with that, at least on the face of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Institute of Chartered Accountants goes further than this, suggesting that banks, which are the major source of external finance and debt for small businesses, should be encouraged to lend against cash flows rather than only against the asset bases of SMEs. In its report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The road to recovery for small business</EMPHASIS>, the Institute of Chartered Accountants recommended that, in order to facilitate increased bank lending on the basis of future cash flows, improved consultation between the government, lending institutions and small businesses was essential. I have to say that at the moment there is no sign that that interaction is taking place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would hope though that meaningful tripartite consultation between the government, the small business sector and potential and actual investors is a feature of the coalition's three&hyphen;year plan for small business. Much fanfare was made about this three&hyphen;year plan in the lead&hyphen;up to the election, but I note with more than passing interest that the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser) has spoken very little, if at all, about it in recent months and since the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government should recognise that the proprietors' capital and money earned by their businesses are the best and cheapest source of revenue. The Institute of Chartered Accountants suggested that all initiatives taken to support the financing of small businesses should adopt this as an overriding principle. And it is something that I subscribe to also.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The small business sector could be excused for its `Let's wait and see' attitude towards the proposed equity investment scheme. The large increase in support for the coalition following its return to the government benches soon gave way to feelings of discomfort and disillusionment. The message that business is sending and that continues to prevail is that endless committees and task forces are no substitute for action and real reform.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has taken steps to implement only minor changes to encourage the small business sector. At the same time, the government has made it very clear that its principal motivation for axing the research and development syndication tax relief scheme and for reducing the general concession to 125 per cent is to stop what it claims is perceived to be a rorting of this scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having spoken on 18 September about the government's announced intentions towards tax incentive programs intended to encourage research and development projects by Australian businesses, it gives me no satisfaction to have to note that nothing the government has said and done since then has mollified my concerns and nor will this proposed legislation. While the government persists in maintaining otherwise, the only valid reason for pruning or axing the R&amp;D tax incentive programs is to improve its revenue in the short term; that is, in the life of this parliament. Being short term, it is also short-sighted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has become obsessed it seems&mdash;at least outwardly&mdash;with the notion of abuse. Yet, as I indicated in my earlier speech, the coalition has not been able to substantiate its claims. The government has, in my opinion, shamelessly harped on this notion of tax avoidance by big business to gain support from the average Australian taxpayer in its decision to axe R&amp;D syndication and related legislation. That public perception was, quite rightly, the level of community anger towards individuals who benefited by ignoring their tax obligations. But we are not talking about the Christopher Skases of business in this context; we are talking about reputable Australian industry engaging in legitimate research and development. We are talking about the savaging of an incentive that was the only effective program likely to induce research and development in our country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The 1994 Bureau of Industry Economics report identified that syndication helped embed a commercial focus in R&amp;D programs and that it was responsible for inducing significant new research and development activity in the companies that took advantage <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7020"> of it. This report found that between 1989 and 1983 syndication was responsible for 23.8 per cent of induced research and development. Yet the government has decided to ignore those findings and persist with what I regard as myopic amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the government's claim that the tax concession remains generous, there is a very real danger that Australia will lose much of its research and development activity to foreign shores should this bill be passed without amendment. This was noted, I might add, in the editorial of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 26 September which stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To pretend that Australia can establish itself as an important finance centre without bidding for business is both naive and complacent. By failing to confront this reality Australia has let an important opportunity slip past largely by default.</PARA>
<PARA>I am not just speaking about a hypothetical situation; I am talking about real business decisions. The reality is that many researchers are abandoning their research here in favour of other countries, including Singapore and Malaysia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A recent article in the<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Business Review Weekly </EMPHASIS>highlighted this very point. That particular article quoted figures from a recent survey of 125 companies by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu. It found that 57 per cent of those companies claiming the concessions said the proposed reduction would have a negative effect on their R&amp;D decisions. It also found that almost a quarter of the respondents and 34 per cent of those who have claimed the concession in the past five years say they are considering moving their research and development efforts overseas as a result of the amendments we are addressing tonight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In the case of the team at the Sydney Children's Hospital Cancer Institute, cutting edge experimentation into the treatment of cancer and AIDS is tipped to relocate to Canada because of the unfavourable R&amp;D environment in Australia. It is imperative that the government tap into the wider scientific pool by encouraging foreign companies to locate their research and development headquarters in Australia. It would be one element of their claim&mdash;so far a forlorn hope&mdash;of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> creating Australia as a financial centre for the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that we will be less competitive in the global marketplace as a result of these amendments. Mr David Forman, the author of the article in BRW to which I earlier referred, states that the changes to the R&amp;D concession must be viewed in an international context. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will not take much of a change in the view of Australia's relative merits and commitment to attracting R&amp;D in a rapidly globalising marketplace for the dream of a clever country to evaporate.</PARA>
<PARA>I could not have said it better myself. Does the government really think that Australian research and development&mdash;like Taubman's paint used to be&mdash;will `keep on keeping on', despite such an unstable if not hostile environment? The truth is that syndication and the general research and development tax concession have emerged as the real driving force behind innovation in Australia. Ms Vivian McCarron, the R&amp;D tax specialist at Coopers and Lybrand, observed in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  earlier this year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . history has shown that without some form of tangible government assistance, Australian investors and corporations tend to be unwilling to put money into research and development.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>R&amp;D is at a crossroads in Australia. With strong endorsement for the R&amp;D concession by several independent industry bodies, it is difficult to reconcile the government's decision as reflected in this bill. It is obvious that the government is kowtowing to a Treasury that is hell&hyphen;bent on revenue protection, and that is the only explanation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is being railroaded, in my opinion, by a Treasury more concerned with the smaller, short-term picture than with the larger, long-term issue of Australia's international competitiveness. I acknowledge the need for economic restraint, given the magnitude of the former government's fiscal mismanagement, but not at all costs.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak in support of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1996. The bill contains a number of measures which will enable this government to deliver election <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7021"> commitments in several important areas and also ensure a fairer taxation system for all Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will enable tax rebates to be provided to people of age pension age who do not receive the age pension. It will provide an incentive for banks and other lending institutions to make long&hyphen;term investments in small business by becoming equity partners. It will also enable the threshold for the medical expenses rebate to increase from $1,000 to $1,500, with medical expenses in excess of the threshold to qualify for a rebate at a rate of 20c in the dollar on the excess. Also included in the bill are measures to withdraw the exemption from tax on income from the sale, transfer or assignment of mining rights for gold or other prescribed metals or minerals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will also implement the repeal of paragraph 120(1)(c) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to remove the unfair commercial and taxation advantages cooperative companies and government lending institutions have over other companies by being able to claim an effective 200 per cent tax deduction for the cost of certain assets. As well, the integrity of the infrastructure borrowings program will be strengthened by enabling amendments to the Development Allowance Authority Act 1992 to prevent schemes from operating which break the symmetry in the special tax treatments of the payer and receiver of interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As was stated in statement 4 of Budget Paper No. 1, if allowed to proceed such schemes would substantially increase the value of tax benefits to those involved and also increase the cost to revenue without a commensurate increase in the funding for the private sector infrastructure projects. This bill will enable measures to be taken to reduce the cost inefficiencies of the research and development tax concession and encourage Australian companies to undertake innovative R&amp;D, which is what we need to increase our international competitiveness. We are very good at R&amp;D in Australia, and this bill will not harm this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will amend the income tax law to deal with transition issues which arise when previously exempt entities become taxable, as <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> well as close a loophole which allowed the conversion of non-rebatable annuities to rebatable annuities and pensions. It is certainly clear all of these seem fair and responsible measures, which will re-establish equity of treatment for both individuals and business under the current taxation system. They are welcome improvements in this sense. I am sure most people will agree with the logic and good sense of these particular measures before us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Another good thing about this bill is it is also heading in the right direction in terms of being user-friendly legislation. Most of it has been written in clear and plain language so it has a clear and commonsense order and feel to it. This is certainly what everyday people in Australia, especially small business, want. People need legislation which is easy to understand instead of making it so complex so they have no other option other than to hire accountants and consultants and accept Australian Taxation Office interpretations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Small business people in my electorate of Moreton, through their two chambers of commerce&mdash;the South-West Chamber and the Southside Chamber&mdash;believe the Australian tax act needs to be shredded and we should start all over again. In fact, a few months ago they shredded a copy of the tax act kindly donated by one local businessman who wanted to see the thing go for a cathartic reason. Over 5,000 pages went through a huge industrial shredder, and they gave me a bag of the shreddings to bring to Canberra as their symbolic protest against the length and complexity of the act which they have to cope with. This bill, however, shows major tax reform is possible without resorting to such a wholesale demolition of the document.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill before us is partly a product of the Tax Law Improvement Project&mdash;T&hyphen;LIP&mdash;which started in 1994 with the aim of rewriting the tax act. The project has had bipartisan support, and I hope this continues because the benefits will be enormous. The challenge for those opposite will be to look at  elements within the tax act which can be changed, which can be simplified, so ordinary, everyday Australians are empowered by the process. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7022">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from reducing complexity, it is important to lower the compliance costs involved with the tax act. Taxpayers and accountants would then become a lot more certain about the law, and less time will be required to interpret the legislation and the laws which come from it. As a result of a simpler taxation system, we can promote fairness by spelling out the rules more clearly. People will adhere to the rules if they can understand them. If we could reduce the 5,000&hyphen;plus pages&mdash;which currently the tax act is&mdash;to, say, 2,500 pages, it would be a good thing. If we could reduce the average sentence length from 140 words to 40 words, it would be a very good thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How can anybody actually follow what the tax act currently is? The people of Australia are without the power they need to cope with the system. We need to empower the people at the expense of the Australian Taxation Office. Sure, the ATO are doing their job interpreting the acts which we pass here. We pass the bills, but they tend to be so complex. We give the ATO a very broad brief&mdash;perhaps a little too much rope&mdash;and the ATO tend to try to please themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You only have to look at the example of the Mutual Pools sales tax case, which started after the rush of tax reform in the mid&hyphen;1980s, where the ATO decided in&hyphen;ground, built&hyphen;on&hyphen;site pools could be afforded exactly the same sales tax treatment as prefabricated fibreglass pools which came from a factory and were delivered into a hole in somebody's backyard. As a result of the ATO's interpretation of sales tax in this particular case, many people paid sales tax on their swimming pools. Some of them, including Mutual Pools, took them to court and the High Court determined the ATO had overstepped the mark. As a result, there was a certain amount of refund which had to be paid back.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ATO have a slogan about taxes building a better Australia. I am sure no-one in this place would dispute the fact taxes certainly do grease the wheel. We all know this. Changes to the tax act over the years have created an industry which helps people to cope with the complexity of the act, but we also have a situation where professionals are not able to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cope on a daily basis. My own accountant has to send out regularly for more updated information on a year&hyphen;by&hyphen;year basis, which costs me money as a client of his. Small businesses in my community are paying much more money each year as they engage consultants through their tax accountants to try to cope with the complexity of the current tax laws. We need to make things simpler.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last Monday, as members would recall, was 11 November which was Remembrance Day, the 78th anniversary of the end of World War I. On the Sunday prior to that, 10 November, I attended a service in Anzac Mall at Campsie which is in my electorate. It was conducted by the Campsie RSL sub&hyphen;branch and many people were present&mdash;local sub&hyphen;branch members, the Salvation Army, the Red Cross, local state members, myself, the mayor, the patron of the Campsie RSL club, Kevin Stewart, a former state member for the area, and the sub&hyphen;branch officers.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can recall attending the first Campsie sub&hyphen;branch service in my electorate on Anzac Day in 1979, a few weeks before I was first elected. I do not think I have missed either an Anzac Day service or a Remembrance Day service that that club has held since then. In my electorate there are many RSL clubs and memorial clubs and they all hold very moving services on days such as this, but the Campsie service always stands out and continues to stand out in my memory. I do not know whether that is due to the simplicity of the services, the attitude of the sub&hyphen;branch members and the officers of the sub&hyphen;branch or the particular hard work that John Campbell, the president of the sub&hyphen;branch, puts in to ensure that the service at Campsie goes properly. But it is always one of those services that continue to stand out in my mind.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I was there two Sundays ago on a sunny Sydney morning listening to the prayers offered by the Salvation Army chaplain, and in particular listening to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Last Post</EMPHASIS>, I was reminded of the two occasions that I have visited the Australian war graves in the Villers&hyphen;Bretonneux area in France. Unlike some members here who were fortunate to go on the Gallipoli pilgrimage a year or so ago, my experience of travelling to parts where young Australians have died has been to that Villers&hyphen;Bretonneux area. I do not think it is possible to visit any of the Australian war graves in that area without being overcome by an incredible sense of sadness caused by looking at all those long lines of white crosses that denote the resting place of young Australians who died so far away from their own homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As there are very few First World War veterans left alive to remind us, often people now forget what happened 70 or 80 years ago. It is amazing thinking of the effect on Australia of the contribution this country made to the effort in that war. During the First World War, Australia had a population of about five million people, but this country sent 330,000 young men to fight in that war and 226,073 became casualties&mdash;68&half; per cent&mdash;and 59,258 died. Australia's contribution to the British Empire, as it was in those days, was the greatest of any country in the Empire.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effect of that sacrifice in the First World War was felt by every family in this country at that time. Every family in this country knew the sadness of a family member who had either died or had been wounded in that war. Many would say that the families of those who were wounded and came back had a worse life than those who might have been luckily saved from that walking death by death itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a member of parliament standing there in Sydney on a sunny Sunday, it brought back to me the great sacrifice that people made. For members of parliament it should also cause them to consider, if ever thinking of whether to commit this country to war, that the people who die in those wars are always our young people and that the people who <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> make the decisions to send them often are people who are quite senior to them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are all aware of the burgeoning costs of health care today&mdash;the cost of new drugs, the cost of keeping patients in hospitals and certainly the cost of new equipment and the technology needed to provide all of those services. However, it is that very technology that, while costly in the developmental stages, can help reduce the overall cost of health care.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to bring to the attention of the House tonight new technology that is at the cutting edge of international development in pre&hyphen;clinical drug trials and diagnostic research to assist in the treatment of cancer, cardiology and psychiatry. I refer to the PET centre at the Austin Hospital in Melbourne. PET stands for positron emission tomography. I visited the PET centre at the Austin Hospital recently and I must say that I was excited by what I saw and heard from the talented and dedicated people who run the PET centre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The PET machine looks to me, as someone with no medical training, much like any other large scanning machine. But that is the only similarity. For while, for example, a CAT scan machine produces an image of structure and anatomy of organs, the PET machine, also using a non&hyphen;invasive technique, produces an image of the physiology of organs. And this together with the use of radioisotopes which, I might add, are produced at the Austin PET centre, provide a unique diagnostic tool because specific biochemical processes occurring within a particular patient are produced. In other words, while conventional scanning machines will produce an image of, for example, a cross&hyphen;section of the brain, the PET machine will produce an image which provides information about the functional and metabolic state of the brain. This is the unique quality of the PET machine because the actual chemical function of the particular organ being investigated is able to be analysed and evaluated.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7024">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To give an actual example of the extraordinary value that this PET machine provides as a diagnostic tool and the clinical application available as a result of this machine, let me tell the House a remarkable story of a young boy who suffered from a severe form of epilepsy. The severity of his disease meant that the only way his condition could be managed was for him to be placed on an extensive regime of medication, with the result that he was rendered incapable of leading anything like a normal life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A PET scan revealed the level of chemical imbalance in a particular area of his brain. This was the first time specialists had been able to identify exactly the area and extent of the problem. This meant that that young boy was able to be operated on and today he leads a normal life. He owes the opportunity he was presented with to lead this normal life to the function of the PET centre at the Austin Hospital and to the talented people who were able to analyse and evaluate the information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The quality of life that that young boy now enjoys cannot be quantified in dollar terms, but just take a moment to consider the cost of his medication, the cost of hospitalisation, the fact that he would never have been able to complete his education or be employed and would have had to exist on a disability pension, and the fact that his family would have had to forgo both social and economic opportunities in order to provide the level of care he would need. Just consider the cost of that in both dollar and human terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another area that the PET centre at the Austin Hospital is pioneering is in the identification of heart disease. For example, the PET scan will identify patients who can be treated successfully using methods other than the costly methods of heart transplant or bypass. Research currently being undertaken using the PET scan was helping to understand heart disease and leading to further investigations to improve treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Specialists at the Austin PET centre are also exploring mechanisms of cancer cell growth and developing methods for more effective treatment of cancer. As well as the PET scanner being used for this level of research into cancer, cardiovascular disease and psy chiatric disease, it is being used to evaluate new drugs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The PET centre at the Austin Hospital has achieved an international reputation in both research and clinical applications and has effectively demonstrated the cost-effectiveness of PET in managing patients. The long-term benefits for patients and cost containment are both real and attainable. I believe that with continued support the PET centre at the Austin Hospital will provide hope for countless people in the future.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I use my time in the adjournment debate tonight to talk about the racism debate that is going on in the community today and to put a little bit of a positive spin on it. Before I do, I just want to revisit a couple of points. I find it particularly sad that in a country like ours, where we have gained so much and come so far in accepting people from other nations into our community, we have to have this debate in the first place. I deplore the role of the people who have contributed in some sense to triggering this debate, and I hope they take the time to ponder what they are doing rather than finding some excuse in trying to evade the depth of their comments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We really do need to see some good leadership in this country today. I could aim that at the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), and I do. But I also aim it at anybody in a position in public office anywhere where they have the ability to take on a position of leadership and actually offer to the community some guidance through this very difficult time that I believe our community is facing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that in our community in Australian society we have always had and always will have people with a minority view of some kind&mdash;people who have a view on a marginalised group. Whether it be that a single parent should not get a pension, whether it be about migrants and the immigration issue or whether it be whether or not we should have foreign aid funding, we will always have those marginalised or small minority views.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7025">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Suddenly some people in the community with some extreme views of these kinds believe it is now acceptable to air those views in a very aggressive way. When I talk about that, I think particularly of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson); the Mayor of Port Lincoln, who I think has been credited, unfortunately, with some of the most damning comments I thought I could ever hear anywhere in the world, let alone in my own country; and the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell). It is not one person. There are a number of people, all of whom should wear responsibility for the sort of scaremongering that is going on in relation to the immigration debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point is, though, that the majority of Australians do not tolerate the sort of behaviour being demonstrated by those sorts of people. It is just not acceptable in our society to physically abuse people because they come from a different country. It is just not acceptable to verbally assault these people. It is not acceptable for children from ethnic backgrounds to feel suddenly threatened in their school ground. Unfortunately, that is happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have to acknowledge, whether the Prime Minister likes it or not, that newspapers in foreign languages, newspapers in countries in South-East Asia, are carrying this story from Australia. Tonight I also heard from some people very well versed on this issue that the internet is now carrying a huge number of reports on the debate in this region of the world, particularly in our own country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are economic reasons why we could argue against these particular views, and they are valid arguments. But, more importantly, there are moral reasons why we should argue against those views. It is more important because these people have come here to make their home. They have done it successfully. We now have second and third generation children of families born of an ethnic background but who have come here. They still look and appear different to the rest of us but, by golly, they are as Australian as the rest of us. They have been long-term investors in their family, in our society and in their contribution to it.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tonight I had the pleasure with my Labor colleagues in the ACT to meet in Parliament House a very large number of representatives of the Asian community in the ACT. The positive reaction we got from those people in hearing their views, in understanding their concerns and in hearing their contributions to the sorts of things they believe we can jointly do to try to overcome some of the bias in the community really made me believe that we will survive this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we will survive it only if people like those we spoke to are given the opportunity to take that role. We will survive it only if all of those people in public office, including the Prime Minister, stop running away from it, draw a line in the sand and say, `No more will we tolerate this outrageous type of behaviour.' It is anathema to this country and to our society. I encourage all members to take that role very seriously within their own electorates as well as within this place.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During today's grievance debate I raised some concerns in regard to the speech last week by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Senator Herron, at the ninth annual Joe and Dame Enid Lyons Lecture at the ANU. I did not have enough time to conclude my remarks so I thought I would use this opportunity during the adjournment debate to pick up the remainder of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister in his address at that lecture made some very extensive and welcome remarks. I think it will become his blueprint for having things done in terms of Aboriginal affairs. I commend the statement to members. I am quite sure that the minister will circulate it to all honourable members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his speech the minister spoke about the high cost of food in Aboriginal communities. He said that in some instances food costs were as much as 50 per cent more than those in capital cities. That is a fact. In fact, in some communities in the Northern Territory, food costs are almost 100 per cent more than <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7026"> capital city prices. I will give some examples. A 100 gram jar of Vegemite would probably cost about $1.45 in Coles here in Canberra. The same jar of Vegemite would probably cost $2.90 in some communities in the Northern Territory. A 350 gram jar of IXL jam would cost about $1.45 to $1.60 in Canberra, depending on the store, but in some of these remote communities in the territory it would cost as much as $3.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The main reason for the high food costs are the transportation costs to the territory, especially to remote areas. Unless the government works out some kind of formula whereby it can subsidise transport operators&mdash;those people who are providing remote communities with freight services&mdash;for moving freight around regional parts of Australia, I do not think the costs will ever go down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister also spoke about real jobs in Aboriginal communities. In his statement he implied that in some communities up to 50 per cent of the community were unemployed. That is quite right, too. Of course, the CDEP program, which has been in place for a number of years, is working, and that will obviously alleviate some of the high unemployment figures which could be reflected if that program were not in place. I will give an example. In October 1995 the Northern Territory's unemployment rate was seven per cent. In October 1996 it was only 4.8 per cent. But if some of the CDEP programs that have been carried on in the Northern Territory are not maintained, obviously, in October 1997 we could see a far different picture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) was asked a question today about water and how the army might help to provide some kind of infrastructure for essential services. In some communities there is no water. No matter what the army or the government does, the water is not there, and the only way people will get water is to cart it in by water tanker. In some communities the cost of water can be as high as $1 per litre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I welcome the minister's initiative in trying to encourage some of the essential services to be provided by the army, but earlier today I cautioned the minister that this program can <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> work only if communities in remote areas are consulted. If you had talked to a community in 1995 and asked them to list their priorities, they would have listed them from 1 to 5. You could go back a year later and the priorities would have changed. That is the important thing&mdash;consultation. Unless we consult, as I said earlier today, we could find the army chasing its tail trying to provide services, especially essential services, to these communities. I will be writing to the minister to outline some of my concerns in terms of the consultation process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I finish, I would like to quote from the remarks of a former minister for Aboriginal affairs, Peter Howson, who said, in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Adelaide Review</EMPHASIS> of September 1996:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The States, local government, community groups and private business all have to be involved in the changes to aboriginal policy which now have to occur. These changes can best be implemented by people who are close to the problems and who have to live with the outcome of what is done. The problems have been exacerbated by Canberra and will now have to be solved by local knowledge and experience. Those people who are concerned about, and have experience in, Aboriginal affairs should now be thinking very strenuously about where we go from here. Aboriginal affairs and the current parlous condition of Aborigines, can no longer be entrusted to the Canberra&hyphen;based Aboriginal industry.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this adjournment debate to address an issue which is of concern to a substantial number of my constituents and a number of Australians of the Orthodox faith&mdash;that is, the lack of proper protection for the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople to carry out its mission. As all of us are aware, His All Holiness, Patriarch Bartholomew I, the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, is currently visiting Australia. However, many Australians would not be aware of the difficulty and danger that the Ecumenical Patriarchate and His All Holiness must continually struggle with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7027"> His All Holiness is the spiritual leader of 300 million Orthodox Christians worldwide. As the Vatican is the heart of Roman Catholi cism, the Ecumenical Patriarchate is the heart of Orthodox Christianity. Today, the great city that was once Constantinople is called Istanbul by the present day Republic of Turkey and is no longer the capital of any empire.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1923, the Turkish government agreed that the Greek Orthodox patriarchate could remain in Istanbul provided that the patriarch confined himself to religious affairs. Since that time, the situation of the patriarchate has fluctuated along with Greek-Turkish relations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of unfortunate incidents have occurred involving the patriarchate. In July and August of 1993 the Christian Orthodox cemetery in Yenikoy, near Istanbul, was desecrated by vandals on two occasions. Many such cemeteries and other religious monuments are continually targeted by vandals. On the night of 30 March 1994 a Molotov cocktail bomb was thrown inside the courtyard of the ecumenical patriarchate itself. On 24 May 1994 three bombs were placed in the attic of the building where His All Holiness resides and were found shortly before they were set to explode.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More recently, the Cathedral Church of St George in Istanbul was bombed, reportedly by the extreme right-wing organisation Great Eastern Islamic Raiders. Another extremely serious problem for the patriarchate is the closing of the Halki Patriarchal School of Theology, the academy that between 1844 and 1971 trained clergy for the ecumenical patriarchate. The closing of the Halki school by the Turkish authorities is in direct violation of international human rights agreements, specifically the Lausanne Treaty signed in 1923. Article 40 of that treaty expressly guarantees the Greek minority in Turkey the right to establish and control religious institutions. That is also a right recognised by the Geneva 1991 conference on security and cooperation in Europe meeting of experts on national minorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further attack on the religious freedoms of the Greek Orthodox minority is a campaign by various government figures and elements of the Turkish press to convert the most famous and most sacred monument of Greek <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Orthodox Christianity, the Church of St Sophia, into a mosque.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, the ecumenical patriarch and those associated with the patriarchate, as Turkish citizens, must be protected under Turkish law against blatant attacks on ethnic minority. It is the Turkish government's obligation to protect the patriarchate, a major international religious institution that is located on Turkish soil, and to guarantee the rights of the Greek minority under international treaties and conventions. Turkey can be proud to have this historical religious institution on its soil and to allow it to flourish.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ecumenical patriarch Bartholomew I is a Turkish citizen who proudly served in the Turkish uniform. The  Turkish nation can be proud of him as an individual and indeed can be proud of his work in providing a bridge in his capacity as head of the Orthodox Church between Eastern and Western Europe. He deserves the encouragement, the support and the protection of the international community.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to pick up from where I left off from my remarks this morning in relation to the bycatch of albatross identified in the third report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. There is also some doubt as to the effectiveness of mitigation devices presently available. The best options appear to be tori poles, bait throwers, night setting and bait thawing. Early results with tori poles suggest a 30 to 75 per cent reduction in seabird bykill. Setting the lines at night avoids catching albatrosses but will catch other seabird species, such as shearwaters and the white-chinned petrel. Initial results of night setting indicate a 70 to 96 per cent reduction in seabird bykill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over 100 Japanese boats have installed bait throwers and it is being used increasingly on Taiwanese vessels. Depending on the design, a 60 to 80 per cent reduction in bykill may be achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A mechanism that shoots the line from the hull so that the hooks do not appear on the surface is working in some long-liners in the Northern Hemisphere. Early indications are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7028"> that a 50 to 70 per cent reduction in seabird bykill can be achieved by thawing baits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other mitigation methods include not discharging offal during line setting, changes in boat design, education of fishing vessel operators and area or seasonal closures of fishing zones. Mitigation measures being developed include colouring the bait, hook design such as smart hooks, artificial bait and identification of best setting techniques.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1995, the previous Minister for the Environment announced a $1.13 million program over four years towards a threat abatement plan. That plan is looking at a suite of measures to reduce albatross bykill. The effectiveness of the threat abatement plan may depend on a number of legal issues. The threat abatement plan must have regard for social and economic impacts under the ESP Act, which may limit the effectiveness in protecting albatross species.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am concerned at the lack of progress on the threat abatement plan as the first meeting was not scheduled until October 1996. The committee was told that not a lot of research is being done into mitigation measures to prevent seabird bycatch pending the development of the threat abatement plan, which still has two years to go. The committee is concerned that this may slow the progress of this research and urges the government to ensure that this does not occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mitigation measures developed as soon as possible will enable their use to be incorporated in the threat abatement plan. It was suggested to the committee that the general impression from research facilities and fishery agencies is that the albatross bycatch could be greatly reduced `without a lot of pain and investment in the technology to reform the fishing methods'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The workshops and meetings for developing the threat abatement plan have now commenced. The committee supports the consultation process being conducted with a range of interested parties. The committee would like to see this broadened, however, to include representatives from New Zealand and Japan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Convention on Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals 1979, the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Bonn convention, provides a framework for enhancing the conservation status of rare and threatened migratory species. Under this convention, Australia is obliged to enter into regional, bilateral and multilateral agreements to ensure effective conservation of migratory species.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was very impressed with the work of the Southern Oceans Seabird Study Association. SOSSA is a wildlife research and conservation group which consists of dedicated people, both professional and trained. Though primarily concerned with the conservation and greater understanding of the seabird fauna of this region, SOSSA is dedicated to greater knowledge of the biodiversity of the southern oceans. I was particularly impressed with the people who are behind SOSSA, amongst many others, but I mention in particular Janice Jenkin-Smith, Lindsay Smith and Harry Battams. The Australian community owes a great debt to these people for their bringing to the attention of both the committee and the people of Australia the terrible plight involving the albatross.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I refer to page 99 of the report, which shows a wonderful photo of an albatross nicknamed Annie. I seek leave to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> the story of Annie from page 3 of the Southern Oceans Seabird Study Association's issue No. 12.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr Costello</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Contingent debt, in a generic sense, is a contract with the form of debt but under which the payment of principal or interest, or both, are contingent on a variable, often a commodity or equity price. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The tax law does not prevent participation by Australian investors in contingent debt markets. Rather, it regulates the tax treatment: contingent debt attracts the tax treatment of debt rather than the tax treatment of equity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has recently been suggested that some debt (if not all debt), including contingent debt, should receive `equity tax benefits'; in particular, such debt should be able to be franked. Proponents of such a move argue that this would provide a substantial overall boost to national savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Upon investigation, however, the proposal would have, at best, an uncertain impact on national saving and is inconsistent with the general purpose of the imputation system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">To achieve an increase in net national savings, the increase in private savings from the proposal must exceed the revenue cost to the Government. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> In light of the potentially significant revenue cost associated with increased franking credit usage (particularly with continued interest deductibility), and an uncertain net private savings response, it is not clear that net national savings would be increased.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's dividend imputation system generally seeks to relieve double taxation of corporate profits distributed as dividends while maintaining one layer of taxation at company level. Maintaining a corporate layer of taxation requires ensuring that the benefits of franking credits pass to those otherwise bearing this burden of double taxation and are not transferred to those who do not. In the presence of interest deductibility, the franking of contingent debt necessarily involves franking credits passing to persons not bearing the burden of double taxation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the franking of contingent debt may be inappropriate, proposals of the above type touch on the more general issue of whether it is desirable for economically similar instruments to receive different tax treatments because of their legal form. This is one of the issues being addressed in the current ATO and Treasury review of the taxation of financial arrangements. In the presence of financial innovation and a continued distinction for tax purposes between debt and equity, there is stronger case for taxing financial arrangements according to their economic substance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the issues are complex, one of the objectives of the review of the taxation of financial arrangements is to identify proposals that will improve the fit between the evolving financial system and the taxation system. This involves removing anomalies and uncertainties, and ensuring that taxation policy does not unduly inhibit the efficient allocation and management of risk throughout the economy. A more certain and neutral system for taxing financial arrangements would facilitate financial innovation while reducing the scope for tax arbitrage that is opened up by certain types of financial innovation. It should also improve the consistency of the application of taxation arrangements at the borderline between debt and equity across a range of financial arrangements, including contingent debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The officials working on this project have consulted widely in an attempt to develop proposals that appropriately reflect industry concerns as well as taxation policy objectives. A Consultative Document on the taxation of financial arrangements was released in December 1993. Submissions received from industry following the release of the Consultative Document have been comprehensively reviewed and an Issues Paper, being prepared by the ATO and the Treasury, addressing the issues raised by those submissions, is at an advanced stage of drafting. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7032"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Issues Paper will set out, and invite comment on, the ATO and Treasury's preferred approach to addressing the major issues raised by industry submissions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The Government's foreign investment guidelines provide for scrutiny of many proposed foreign purchases of Australian businesses and properties. For most industry sectors, including the services sector, which incorporates the sports/entertainment industry, proposals for the establishment of new businesses involving total investment of $10 million or more and proposals for the acquisition of existing businesses with total assets valued at more than $5 million are notifiable. Proposals where the assets or planned investment outlays are valued above these thresholds but below $50 million will normally be approved without detailed examination. Proposals where the valuation is $50 million or more will be approved unless judged by the Government to be contrary to the national interest. The Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 (the Act) provides legislative backing for ensuring compliance with the guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">While most foreign investment brings direct economic benefits to Australia, the Government has the power under the Act to block proposals that are determined to be contrary to the national interest. There are also powers to impose conditions when approving foreign investment proposals. Specific restrictions on foreign investment are in force in more sensitive sectors such as the media and developed residential real estate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) and (3) The competitive conduct rules of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Part IV) includes a prohibition on `exclusive dealing' (s.47). <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">These rules prohibit exclusive supply arrangements which substantially lessen competition in an Australian market. For instance, an arrangement for the exclusive supply of transmission services by infrastructure owners to carriers would be illegal if it substantially lessens competition in an Australian market. This prohibition is, however, subject to the qualification that the parties can obtain immunity for such an arrangement by giving notice to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. If the Commission believes that the arrangement will not generate an overall benefit to the public, it can terminate that immunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The national competition policy reforms have led to the establishment of a legislated regime for access to the services of certain key infrastructure facilities. The regime came into operation on 6 November 1995. This regime sets out a process whereby the Commission can, following Ministerial declaration, require a facility operator to provide access in certain situations. In doing so, the Commission can override exclusive rights between facility operators and users where those rights are not being used.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The access regime provides for access to infrastructure services. In the case of communications infrastructure this may include broadcasting services or communications services, ie the service of transmitting information. However, it does not provide for access to the information itself. Generally the regime cannot be used to obtain access to intellectual property.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) In June this year the ABS assigned a very experienced senior officer to be the ABS Year 2000 project coordinator on a full-time basis. The coordinator will shortly be producing a strategy document for consideration by senior ABS management. It will describe the issues and opportunities and propose various actions requiring the participation of many ABS staff at some time over the next few years. In the meantime, extensive information is being gathered (eg through attendance at "Year 2000" seminars, discussions with a number of vendors of Year 2000 services, and discussions with key IT Suppliers). Information is also being gathered through literature searches on the Internet and from other sources and lodged on a widely used in-house discussion database. The ABS is also represented on the Year 2000 Sub&hyphen;Committee of the Government Information Services Policy Board.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Any action that is justifiable will be taken at an appropriate time. The ABS strategy involves performing a "Year 2000" risk assessment for all ABS computer systems as well as for connections with other organisations. It is anticipated some systems will need to be suitably modified, some will be replaced or withdrawn, some will not require any modification, and some very low-risk systems will be presumed correct (with appropriate contingency plans). Wherever practicable, modifications will be made concurrently with changes required for other business reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian Competition and Consumer Commission</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has completed a preliminary examination into the "Year 2000 Problems" regarding computer systems.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian Taxation Office</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) has established a project to fully address the Year 2000 date issue for its computer systems. An inventory of all in&hyphen;house and third party systems is being compiled and impacts assessed. Planning is underway for system modification and testing. Conversion and testing of some systems has already commenced and it is anticipated that testing of all systems will be substantially complete by the end of calendar year 1998.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Detailed costing has yet to be performed. The initial estimate for costs to modify and test systems is of the order of $4.2 million. In addition, the ATO may need to upgrade its mainframe system software in an earlier time frame than originally planned, resulting in an increased expenditure of approximately $2.8 million. Whilst the ATO will attempt to accommodate testing associated with Year 2000 changes on its current computing equipment, there is a real possibility that equipment will need to be acquired for this purpose, at an estimated cost of $1.8 million.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) It is intended that all current systems which are required to be in use after 1 January 2000 will be modified and fully tested well before that date. All new systems being developed will be designed to accommodate the Year 2000.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) As at December 1995, it is estimated that there were approximately 2800 recipients of Disability Support Pension residing in the electoral division of Bruce (source: <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Recipients of Social Security Benefits in Commonwealth Electoral Divisions December 1995 Background Paper No 8 of 1995/96</EMPHASIS> ).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) There are two measures from the 1996/97 Budget concerning medical eligibility for Disability Support Pension. These are the medical reviews of former recipients of Invalid Pension, and the introduction of the revised Impairment Tables. The estimates of the number of people affected by these measures are based on national, point&hyphen;in&hyphen;time data. When applied to small areas, the figures are potentially subject to a margin of error, and should be regarded as indicative only. The estimates provided for the electoral division of Bruce are based on DSS data and Background Paper No 8 [referred to at (1)].</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) It is estimated that slightly more than 100 former recipients of Invalid Pension living in the electoral division of Bruce, will apply for another form of income support (usually Newstart Allowance) after their medical eligibility for Disability Support Pension is reviewed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">With regard to the introduction of the revised Impairment Tables, it is estimated that less than 10 people claiming Disability Support Pension will be affected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) It is estimated that, following medical review, less than 20 Disability Support Pension recipients in the electorate of Bruce who formerly received Invalid Pension will be ineligible for any form of Social Security income support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">With regard to the introduction of the revised Impairment Tables, it is expected that the number of Disability Support Pension claimants affected will be in single figures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) In accordance with long&hyphen;standing criteria Disability Support Pension (DSP) recipients are required to transfer to Newstart Allowance only if they are found to have:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Customers who lose entitlement because of these decisions will have a range of physical, intellectual and psychological disabilities which have only a minor impact on their ability to work.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) to (6) There has been no change to the provisions that govern these contingencies. Payment is not stopped unless the circumstances of the case have been fully investigated and all mitigating factors taken into account.

If an intellectual or other disability is the cause of the breach, it is unlikely that a penalty would be imposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) Newstart customers with disabilities have the same appeal rights as other customers. They can ask for the decision to be reviewed by a Departmental Authorised Review Officer.

If still dissatisfied, they can go to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and finally, in some circumstances to the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(8) Customers are not charged for appeals to an Authorised Review Officer, the Social Security Appeals Tribunal or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.

Of these, most will be eligible for income support in the form of Newstart Allowance. A small minority will not be eligible for any Social Security payment on the grounds that the level of their income and/or assets precludes payment. In such cases, people are expected to use their private resources for self&hyphen;support.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The Government will continue to facilitate the appointment of consumer representatives to relevant consultative and dispute resolution bodies. The Consumer's Federation of Australia (CFA), like all other consumer organisations, will continue to have the opportunity to nominate qualified people to fill these positions; in fact CFA has already submitted nominations for a vacant position. The Government's approach, using advertising as well as direct approaches to relevant organisations, will actually widen the pool of potential representatives. It should be noted that many consumer representatives on government bodies have been and are selected independently of advice from the CFA and these arrangements will not be affected by the Budget decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Consumers in rural and regional areas, and the smaller States, will continue to have access to government, regulators and industry representatives. This access was not conditional on the good offices of CFA and occurs, in virtually all cases, independently of CFA. CFA's main role in this respect was to provide nominations for consumer representative positions; as explained earlier in this answer, the access of people outside the major cities will, in fact, be enhanced by the Government's use of direct advertising for nominations. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs has been directed to facilitate contact between Commonwealth agencies and consumer groups. The Bureau will consult widely with consumers on developing consumer issues and policies to ensure that the Government stays informed of consumer views. When needed, the Bureau will convene suitable fora on emerging consumer issues to bring together industry and consumer representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Funding to the CFA ceased from 21 August 1996. The CFA has received Commonwealth funding for over 20 years and the grant has represented the major portion of the CFA's annual revenue. The CFA has been funded by previous governments on an annual basis, subject to review in the Budget. Future funding was not assured, either by this or previous governments. The CFA was responsible for its own staffing arrangements&mdash;the Commonwealth's funding was for particular purposes, not specific positions.

The 2,000 places allocated onshore will provide for the estimated number of people granted permanent residence as a result of meeting the United Nations' refugee criteria in Australia. Should onshore grants exceed 2,000, the excess will be absorbed into the offshore program, so that humanitarian resettlement services can properly meet needs.

Between 1991/92 and 1995/96 some 14,300 people were resettled under this Special Assistance Category.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Given the diverse range of memorials across the country, it is not possible to state the position in relation to each memorial without knowing the particular circumstances of that memorial's establishment and its nature. However, speaking generally, if the memorial is located on land held under freehold or if it comprises a building or other permanent structure that is a public work, it will have extinguished native title. If it is on leasehold land, it will have extinguished native title, if not wholly, then to the extent of any inconsistency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) All Australian citizens have a right to bring their claims, of whatever nature, before a court. This does not mean, however, that claims will be successful in establishing that native title exists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">While there is no legislative bar to a native title claim being made over a war memorial, such a claim is unlikely to be successful, for the reasons given in (1) above. There are also likely to be significant obstacles to any such claims being registered under the new registration test in the proposed amendments and therefore attracting the right to negotiate and other statutory benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Access to Australian war memorials will not be restricted or prohibited under proposed legislation. Assuming that the question is referring to the restriction of access by the public, confirmation of public access and enjoyment of public places is provided by paragraph 212(2)(e) of the NTA which states that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"A law of the Commonwealth, a State or Territory may confirm any existing public access to and enjoyment of areas that were public places at the end of 31 December 1993."</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">All States and Territories have passed legislation to ensure such public access.</PARA>
