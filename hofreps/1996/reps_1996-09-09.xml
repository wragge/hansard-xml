<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OJ4">Mr TAYLOR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The tabling of this report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties is a significant event for both the committee and the parliament. While it is a relatively short cameo report, it contains a number of intentions and recommendations which the committee feels will improve the parliamentary processes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This committee came into existence as a result of widespread community concerns about the treaty making process. In the short time since it was formed, I and my colleagues would like to think that it has begun to change not only practices but, more importantly, attitudes to the process of making treaties in this country. Public perceptions of past processes generally have been critical of inadequate consultation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The establishment of this committee was foreshadowed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) in his first ministerial statement on 2 May this year and gave substance to assurances given by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) when in opposition last year. I would like to thank the foreign minister, the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) and their departmental staff for getting the committee off to a good start. I would like to make some general comments about the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> revised procedures which have been set in place by the government, together with a few words on the way the new arrangements are working.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to the present arrangements, while lists of the treaties into which Australia had entered were tabled in the parliament each six months, the Australian people had no way of knowing what their government had done in their name. Increasingly, this closed process caused concern at all levels of society. Significantly, it resulted in a lack of knowledge within the bureaucracy of the implications of these treaties. This, to take one notable example, lead to the High Court's judgment in the Teoh case, with continuing legislative question marks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In November 1995, the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee tabled a report titled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Trick or treaty? Commonwealth power to make and implement treaties</EMPHASIS>. This report reflected concerns about the impact of international treaties on Australia's federal system and the degree of consultation undertaken by government prior to ratification.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Included in its recommendations were the establishment by legislation of a joint treaties committee, the preparation of treaty impact statements for each treaty tabled in parliament, and increased efforts by government to identify and consult groups which may be affected by a treaty into which Australia proposes to enter. It is pleasing that a number of senators from that committee are now continuing their work as members of the joint committee. National interest analyses are now required for each treaty, and there is also a much greater emphasis on consulting those who might be concerned. A treaties council of COAG has been established also.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Treaties now will be tabled for 15 sitting days, at the end of which time the committee is expected to report to the parliament. Provision has been made also for the tabling of urgent treaties which cannot be tabled for 15 sitting days before action must be taken. I will say more on that later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In its turn, the committee has advised the Minister for Foreign Affairs that, as soon as practicable after each tabling, it will inform <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> him of those treaties on which it will report at the end of the 15&hyphen;day period and those for which it will require additional time to report. In the latter cases, it is the committee's expectation that binding treaty action will not be taken until it has tabled a report. This report completes the process for consideration of the 25 treaties tabled on 21 May and 18 June. It does not comment in detail on each of those treaties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Highlighting briefly a number of issues, the committee found that the multilateral regional convention on hazardous wastes, the Waigani convention, is an appropriate way for the small countries of the South Pacific to deal with their hazardous waste, given their limited bureaucratic and other resources. Additionally, it has sought information on successful Australian tenders for work being carried out under the agreement with the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organisation&mdash;KEDO. With regard to the agreement establishing the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, the committee has called for a progress report on the institute after it has been in operation for 12 months and to validate its need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee, after lengthy discussion, decided not to undertake an inquiry into the treaty with Indonesia on maintaining security at this time, but will consider an inquiry when it has been in operation for a year or so. It agreed also to undertake a relatively short inquiry into the subsidiary agreement between the governments of Australia and Japan concerning tuna long&hyphen;line fishing. This has resulted in a large number of submissions. The response demonstrates that there is genuine interest in treaty making at the community level in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee also decided to investigate and report on the implications for Australia of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification, which was tabled in parliament on 5 December 1994. Although this falls outside the 15 sitting day rule, nothing in the committee's resolution of appointment prevents it from examining treaties which have already been tabled. We intend to table a report on that as early as practicable in 1997.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3668">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is still too early to assess with any precision the effectiveness of our approach and the new processes. In this context, we understand that another small group of treaties will be tabled tomorrow, for report by 28 October. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB2></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take this opportunity to make a statement in support of what the chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, the member for Groom (Mr Taylor), said in presenting the committee's first report. I should add at the outset that the chairman of the committee has done a commendable job, as have the staff, in getting the committee up and running. It is a very inclusive committee and one of great enthusiasm.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a fact of life that treaties affect virtually all Australians. For instance, much of our food and clothing or their ingredients and raw materials have come to our shores through a transportation system heavily regulated by treaties affecting sea and air transport. When we get on a plane we are somewhat safer as <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a result of international treaties relating to the carriage of passengers. Although there is still a long way to go, our streets are at least somewhat safer as a result of international treaties and conventions relating to restrictions on drug trafficking. Our prospects of survival and those of our children are considerably enhanced as a result of treaties restricting the proliferation of nuclear weapons together with treaties aimed at preserving our environment, including the depletion of the ozone layer and the associated effects of global warming.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It must be conceded that there have been controversies in recent times as to the extent to which our laws should be based upon international treaty obligations relating to human rights, such as the rights of children, the rights of migrants and the rights of workers. There is also no doubt that the existence of treaties has significantly influenced our courts as has been noted by the High Court of Australia not only in terms of construing legislation but also, more recently, in terms of the more controversial decision in Teoh's case of assessing the appropriateness of administrative conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In short, treaties are a reality. The world is becoming increasingly international. Unless Australia, with its relatively small population, participates in that international community there is no doubt we will regress dramatically. Essentially, we have two choices. On the one hand, we can live in a world where the superpowers predominate. It comes to a situation where the superpowers say to the smaller states `jump' and those smaller states without treaties are left with no option but to say `how high'. On the other hand, we can participate in the international community to develop and enhance the international rule of law through the international treaty making process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When it is seen in that context, Australia really has no choice at all. It is regrettable that in recent years an increasingly isolationist mood has developed. That isolationist mood has developed to some extent as a result of the lack of input in the broader treaty making process by the population as a whole and not simply state governments. I trust that the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3669"> treaties committee will significantly alter those perceptions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you analyse the situation you find that it is not the treaties that have caused the apprehension; it is more a concern that Federal laws predominate state legislation. In that context, the role of this federal parliament in scrutinising treaties cannot be underestimated. There is no doubt that if all Australians feel they have an input in the treaty making process treaties themselves will have greater efficacy. I think Australia's role as a good international citizen will be enhanced. I commend this report to the parliament.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to speak in support of this historic first report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. This report is important because it outlines the way in which the committee will work as it deals with the important task of scrutinising treaties which Australia is about to ratify. On only the second working day of the new parliament the coalition government moved to reform the federal government's international treaty making procedures. While everyone accepts that it is necessary from time to time for a federal government to make arrangements with other countries and to sign international treaties, there has been widespread concern about the way in which the previous government used its treaty making powers without consulting with the Australian people or the parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The population was alarmed to find out that our nation had obligations under an international treaty that they did not even know existed or did not know had been signed by our government. Frequently, parliament was only told days after our government had ratified a treaty that action had been taken and our country had assumed new obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the assistance of the High Court, international treaties have been used to radically change the balance of powers between the Commonwealth and the states and to justify social and other legislation which may not necessarily have had the support of the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been a range of measures taken by the new government to restore community <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> confidence in the important treaty making processes. The government has undertaken to restore the procedure used by the Menzies government to table all treaties in parliament at least 15 sitting days before the government ratifies the treaty. Treaties tabled in parliament are to be accompanied by a national interest analysis to enable parliamentary and community scrutiny of their contents. This analysis will also explain why the government wants to ratify the treaty. The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties is also an important element of the new treaty making process. The committee will examine international instruments referred to it and treaties under consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth has also acted to ask the states to join in creating a treaties council as an adjunct to the Council of Australian Governments so that the states also will have a role in the treaty making process. Australia over the years has signed hundreds of international agreements. The government is also working to establish a database so that interested persons and groups can know, free of charge, what treaties have been signed and what their contents are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report demonstrates something of the huge task that the new joint committee will have to face. When the committee had its first meeting it was advised that it already had 25 treaties on its agenda. As the chairman advised today, it is understood that another group of treaties are to be tabled in the parliament today or tomorrow. This means that the committee has a lot of work to do in assessing the merits of each of these treaties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a sense, the committee has indicated to the parliament in its first report that it is not going to be able to examine every single treaty completely and thoroughly. There is a lot of work to be done. Some of the treaties are very complex and cover many pages. So we are going to have to look at those which create the greatest public interest and make an assessment as to which ones require detailed scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope the public will help the committee by indicating early that it has concerns about a particular agreement so we are able to institute an inquiry at the earliest possible <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3670"> time, preferably within the 15 days which we are allowed. It is not going to be possible to review all treaties in detail but, hopefully, we will be able to examine those with the greatest impact. I think the new treaty making arrangements fulfil an important coalition election promise and will go a long way towards restoring public confidence in the way in which Australia makes international agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The chairman has asked me to mention as well and to comment on the fact that Minister Downer indicated when tabling his May statement that sometimes it would be necessary for the 15&hyphen;day rule to not be applied when there are urgent considerations. The committee hopes, and is keen to impress the point, that urgent cases should remain just that and that most treaties should be dealt with according to the specified time scale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee is going about its task with a degree of enthusiasm. We are conscious of the important work that has to be done. For the first time in many years there will be a formal process in place for the scrutiny of treaties before they are ratified. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(12.48 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join in commending the government's decision to establish this committee. I would see two fundamental reasons why that was necessary. One of them is perhaps explained by Erik Jurgens in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Journal of Legislative Studies</EMPHASIS>  in the summer of 1995. He stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As treaties are made by governments, parliaments can only accept or reject them. This fact delimits parliamentary sovereignty in an important way, especially in an era in which public affairs by sheer necessity are more and more regulated by international law.</PARA>
<PARA>He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Traditional and practical reasons have until now blocked innovations in the structure of most democracies in this field even though treaties are having a growing influence on the daily life of citizens. Parliamentarians, constitutional lawyers and political scientists should sit up and take notice.</PARA>
<PARA>So, essentially, one of the main reasons for this committee is parliamentary sovereignty, the struggle between the executive and the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> elected representatives. Secondly, there has been a fear growing that the parliament&mdash;it has had very little role&mdash;and the executive are essentially making international treaties without consideration of the views of the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that whilst there are legitimate concerns and whilst this committee was very necessary&mdash;and in its role so far it has displayed a bipartisan belief in the need for reasserting parliamentary control in this sphere&mdash;some of the concerns have been inflated. There have been claims that Australia is party to 2,000 treaties. The reality is 720, which pales into insignificance compared with the United States which, despite far more constitutional restrictions than we have, is a party to 7,000 treaties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are views that declarations by the United Nations are, per se, immediately treaties, which is totally incorrect. There is a view that when we sign agreements in cases where the governments do not intend them to be binding they are again, per se, treaties. I think that one of the roles of this committee, as has been instanced earlier, is to make sure the public does feel it has an input in the process; to widen consultation; and to seek interest groups&mdash;whether environmentalists, the mining industry or foreign affairs analysts&mdash;to ensure there is not a belief in the electorate that agreements are reached behind their backs and that they have no say.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two things in my view are of increasing concern in this country. The first is that Australia has not been active enough in attempting to ensure the effective operation of these treaties in other countries in our region. There is a view, perhaps, that we go for the most hard line and wide interpretation possible of what these treaties mean. At the same time, we are not working hard enough to ensure that other countries in this region become signatories and, once they do, that they have even the remotest connection with those treaties. Restrictions are being enforced in this country which are far greater than in some others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, I am concerned about the danger of some interventionist court extending, beyond the original intentions of even the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3671"> government of the day, the meanings of these treaties. It might not be a very popular view but the Teoh case gives an indication of some of the extensions that are very questionable. The situation is that treaties have had great eminence in this country. They include the comprehensive test ban treaty, the questions of GATT and the Uruguay Round and the law of the sea convention. We have been out there. On some of these matters there has not been too much dispute between the parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to recognise that, wherever we come from in the broad political perspective, we have to convince the public that there is something to gain by our adherence to these treaties, whether in regard to the movement of hazardous waste, the fishing industry of the region, international disarmament, ILO conventions and so on. There are gains to be made and we have to make sure that this committee operates to reassure the electorate. I commend the initiatives of the committee in making it clear to the foreign minister that exceptions, because of the seriousness and urgency of those treaties, are to be very limited and that, essentially, the committee is determined to make sure it does assert itself.</PARA>

<TIME.STAMP>(12.54 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Speaker, I present the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996. Last year, the Northern Territory became the only place in the world to legalise what proponents describe as voluntary euthanasia&mdash;in reality, intentional killing and assisted suicide. Whether intended or not the act, passed by a legislature representing less than one per cent of the national population, has a direct impact on other Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Far from its operation being limited to Northern Territory residents, people have travelled from elsewhere seeking to use the act. This then is a national issue.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let there be no doubt about what the Northern Territory has done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Northern Territory act is not about the discontinuance of futile or heroic treatment. It is not about the refusal of burdensome or unwanted medical attention. It is not about the appointment of an agent to make decisions about treatment for an incompetent person. And it is not about the provision of modern, pain&hyphen;relieving palliative care. The Northern Territory act is about one thing&mdash;the use of a lethal injection to bring about the immediate death of another. This, Mr Acting Speaker, is a Commonwealth bill to stop lethal injections.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Four reservations expressed about the draft bill have been met. The new bill does not single out the Northern Territory; it enacts a law to the extent of the Commonwealth's power. The bill does not invalidate the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3672"> Territory's Natural Death Act. This bill is solely about euthanasia and no other matter. And this new bill has no retrospective effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill restates two clear principles about the treatment of the dying and the disabled in our society. First, the bill states that the legislative assemblies have no power to make laws which permit or have the effect of permitting the form of intentional killing of another called euthanasia&mdash;which includes mercy killing&mdash;or the assisting of a person to terminate his or her life. Secondly, the bill confirms that the legislative assemblies do have power to make laws with respect to the withdrawal or withholding of medical or surgical measures for prolonging the life of a patient, and of medical treatment in the provision of palliative care to a dying patient&mdash;but not so as to permit intentional killing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These principles reflect the state of the law throughout Australia, with the notable exception of the Northern Territory. Every other state and territory has laws which proscribe intentional killing and assisted suicide. Where these issues have been addressed in recent years&mdash;in Victoria, South Australia and the ACT&mdash;euthanasia has been rejected. Plans to legalise it in New South Wales were dropped in the face of overwhelming parliamentary opposition. The national approach to rejecting the intentional killing of the terminally ill and assisted suicide is therefore reflected in this Commonwealth bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By enacting its legislation, not only has the Northern Territory rejected this national approach; it has ignored the findings of every major committee of inquiry in the world, it has cast aside the ethical principles of the world medical profession, it has rejected the tenets of every major religious group, it has ignored the concerns of its own Aboriginal people, and it has turned a blind eye to the evidence of widespread abuse of euthanasia in the Netherlands. The Northern Territory has also failed to do two things which could reasonably be expected of a legislature concerned about caring for the dying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First, there has been no attempt to introduce modern refusal of treatment legislation as in Victoria and South Australia. Instead, the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Northern Territory clings to its Natural Death Act, antiquated legislation which originated in America two decades ago. Hence there are no provisions for the appointment of agents to make medical decisions on behalf of a person who becomes incapable of doing so. Secondly, the standard of palliative care in the Northern Territory is totally inadequate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead, the Northern Territory chose to bypass a caring response for all dying people and to legalise assisted suicide for a few. The Commonwealth parliament clearly has the constitutional power&mdash;and, I believe, the duty&mdash;to enact this bill. I commend it to all honourable members. I present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That this House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> notes that Australian citizens in Croatia have no easy access to an Australian embassy and the nearest Australian embassies are in Belgrade and Vienna, of which the former may be inappropriate for the use of some Australian visitors and the latter is an inconvenient distance away;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> therefore calls on the Australian Government to establish an Australian embassy in Zagreb, Croatia.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Acting Speaker, with the recognition of the independence of Croatia by Australia in 1992, with the settling down of some aspects of the war that occurred in the region, most particularly in Croatia itself, and with the continuing work towards final resolution of the question of the eastern Slovenia region of Croatia&mdash;which will come back into Croatian government control in the not too distant future&mdash;there is now an important need for the establishment of an Australian embassy in Croatia.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3673">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would now like to refer to some arguments moved in favour of this by Mato Tkalcevic, a coordinator with the Australian Croatian Congress, in an excellent letter to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer). In that letter he gave a number of arguments in favour of the establishment of an Australian embassy in Croatia. The first is that there is quite clearly a very large Australian Croatian community and they, in contrast with other community groups within the country, view the absence of an Australian embassy in Croatia as a disadvantage. They are very much in favour of the establishment as soon as possible of an embassy in Zagreb.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the establishment of an embassy is also supported very strongly by Australian citizens who originated from the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as members of the Slovenian community. Also, the Australian Croatian community is one of the largest communities in the country and they view the continuing maintenance of embassies in countries from which other large communities have emigrated to Australia as being unfair and they would like to see that unfairness redressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also a wide range of other reasons for the establishment of an embassy as soon as possible. I suppose the most compelling and important in view of the development of relations between our country and Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina is that currently the embassies providing services for Australian citizens are in Vienna in the case of Croatia and, in the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Belgrade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australian citizens, including those of Croatian and Bosnia and Herzegovina descent, being required to travel to either Vienna or Belgrade in order to avail themselves of Australian embassy services is obviously a very difficult situation indeed. It obviously means that people who are perhaps impoverished by war, who may have lost their possessions, are being required to travel such long distances and incur travel and accommodation expenses. Also, if they have to travel to Vienna they may have difficulties in understanding the principal language.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thanks to advice to me from the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper), I note that ironically in the case of the Vienna embassy, people in Bratislava, the capital of the Slovac republic, which is on the Danube River only 60 kilometres from Vienna, are required to go to Poland in order to avail themselves of Australian embassy services. So in eastern Europe apparently some illogical judgments are being made in the provision of embassy services. In particular, Vienna is some 400-odd kilometres from Zagreb, from Croatia, and that means a substantial journey for people who wish to avail themselves of the services that are normally provided in an embassy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have become aware from a number of complaints, not only from constituents but from others in the Australian Croatian community, that the consular service in Zagreb is inadequate. In fact, it provides a service that is not up to scratch. There is a view that the service provided&mdash;I make no reflection on the honorary consul, who is doing a good job under the circumstances&mdash;is not commensurate with the present interests in relations between Australia and Croatia. Also, if some estimated 10,000 Croatian Australians&mdash;that is, people with Australian citizenship who are residing in Croatia&mdash;need the facilities of an embassy from their own country, they are also required to travel to Vienna.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an increase in people travelling from Australia to Croatia and also to Bosnia and Herzegovina. It also seems unfair that Australian citizens travelling to these countries from Australia are unable to avail themselves of a full range of embassy services. It is something they find and I consider to be unfair. The unfairness is compounded by the fact that they can see the continuance of a full-scale embassy presence in Belgrade, in what is now known as the Republic of Yugoslavia&mdash;or the rump Yugoslavia, as it is colloquially known. They would say that, if no embassy is to be provided in Zagreb, perhaps the presence of the embassy in Belgrade ought to be reconsidered as a matter of course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3674"> We know from announcements in the budget and prior to the budget that there are to be cutbacks to our missions abroad. Be cause of some of the funding problems caused by the previous government and the response by the incoming government to those, there is obviously some justification for cutbacks. However, in relation to the proposed embassy in Zagreb, I think there is a very good case that the establishment of such an embassy would be far more important to Australia's interests than, say, retaining our embassy in Nepal or our High Commission in Trinidad and Tobago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are judgments, obviously, the Minister for Foreign Affairs will have to make. Nonetheless, many Australian citizens, not only of Croatian descent but also of other descents, would view this situation&mdash;that at present we run only a very small consular service in Zagreb, which is in a country with which we would want to increase our economic, sporting and cultural ties&mdash;as somewhat strange under the circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are other obvious issues at stake. One is the relative standing of Australia's interests in Zagreb with relation to other nations. For instance, there are no fewer than 16 embassies and 54 consuls general and consulates located in Zagreb. It seems that, if one were to view Australia as having an important relationship with the Republic of Croatia, the absence of an embassy in Zagreb belies that interest. In other words, we are making a symbolic gesture by not having an embassy; we are saying that we do not consider the relationship to be as important as perhaps our relationship with Kazakhstan, where Australia has an embassy in Alma&hyphen;Ata.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have, as we know, substantial opportunities in eastern Europe for an increase in trade, particularly for us to be able to sell the products that we manufacture, grow or produce. Yet it seems that our eastern European policy, or our foreign representation there, is thwarted to a certain degree by the absence of an embassy in Croatia, which has most of the coastline that is of critical importance in the northern Adriatic region. The absence of an embassy in Zagreb also thwarts the opportunities for Australia to be able to increase its trade not only to Croatia but also to Germany and other countries within the immediate <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> region who would use the port facilities as an opportunity for greater trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by saying that I believe the absence of a full embassy service in Zagreb is a matter of great concern to many Australian citizens. It is high time that the Australian government established an embassy in Zagreb as a matter of urgency.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(1.09 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the motion, happily put forward by the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing). In speaking to this motion, I would like to acknowledge the work that the honourable member for Moore has put in to representing many of his constituents of Croatian origin. The member has been to Croatia twice in seeking to assist the families and friends of many of his constituents during the tragic warfare that has gone on there. His interest in and work on the issue have been admirable. I know that his visits to the area involved some considerable personal risk. I congratulate the member for his work in Croatia and on the issue which he has worked on since his election in 1990.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As in all members' offices, I deal with numerous immigration inquiries and many of these are associated with all areas of the former Yugoslav republic and in particular Croatia. Within Stirling there is a large population of ethnic make-up and of course a significant portion, including a recently acquired son-in-law of mine, is of Croatian background.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The end of the war in the former Yugoslavia saw the eventual recognition of Croatia as an independent nation and on 15 January 1992 Croatia was recognised by the European Community member states. The following day the then Prime Minister, Mr Keating, announced that Australia had decided to recognise Croatia and Slovenia as independent nations. On that same day, 16 January 1992, the then Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, former Senator Gareth Evans, issued a news release announcing the establishment by Australia of diplomatic relations with Croatia and Slovenia. In his news release, former Senator Evans stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recognition by the international community is the culmination of the process of self determination on <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3675"> which the people of Croatia and Slovenia have embarked.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The governments of Croatia and Slovenia have given the necessary undertakings&mdash;identified by the European Community&mdash;about respect for the rule of law, observation of human rights, acceptance of democratic principles and willingness to abide by international obligations and Australia accordingly wishes to enter into diplomatic relations with both countries.</PARA>
<PARA>Former Senator Evans's release continued that Australia intended to establish a consulate in Zagreb to be headed, in the first instance, by an honorary consul. An Australian consulate, headed by an honorary consul, was opened in Zagreb in March 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I was saying before, my office handles numerous immigration inquiries dealing with residents of Croatia whose families reside in Stirling. When assisting these families, I am required to deal with the nearest Australian embassies&mdash;which, as the motion indicates, are in Belgrade and Vienna. Furthermore, I accept the latter part of the first point of the motion that Belgrade may be, for many residents, an inappropriate embassy to use, while Vienna is an inconvenient distance away, as has already been mentioned by the member for Moore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Notwithstanding those points, staff from Australia's embassy in Vienna visit Zagreb regularly to provide a full range of consular services, including passport application interviews, which the honorary consul cannot provide; undertaking notarial acts, again which the honorary consul cannot provide; general consular matters; and briefing and on-the-job training for the honorary consul. Presently, Australia is represented in Croatia through the accreditation of the Australian ambassador resident in Vienna. He visits Croatia several times a year. In addition, a political counsellor from the Australian embassy in Vienna is in Zagreb every few weeks maintaining close contact with the Croatian authorities on a range of bilateral, commercial and international issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I realise, through experience and anecdotal evidence, that these embassies&mdash;that is, in Vienna and Belgrade&mdash;also deal with local inquiries and the added workload from people from Croatia delays the assistance that can be <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> provided. Additionally, the problem is compounded when those from Croatia seeking assistance from these embassies must battle the tyranny of time and distance in seeking expeditious resolutions to their inquiries and applications. For example, they jump one hurdle in providing their employment and education history; then they may need a health report provided. That adds to the time it takes to provide it, as they often need to visit the embassy, following which it goes through the decision-making process. And so on it goes, all the while taking some considerable amount of time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I often receive correspondence back from the Belgrade embassy advising that certain inquiries I have forwarded to them will take a number of months before I get a response, as they need various pieces of information about the person being assisted and that takes time to both acquire and to deliver. With an embassy in Zagreb these inconveniences and delays could be minimised or avoided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I accept the thrust of the motion, I remain wary of the cost involved in such an establishment. While not putting the kybosh on the initiative, one must bear in mind that the establishment of an embassy would be a costly exercise, particularly in view of the legacy left by the previous government. What is more, the nature of Australian representation in any country depends on our overall political and economic interests in that country. While it would be well and good to establish embassies in various countries, these decisions must be made in the context of Australia's financial position. As such, it is difficult to agree to such spending when we are staring at the financial mess bequeathed by the former Keating government&mdash;although the point made by the member for Moore about our high commission in Trinidad and Tobago is well made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point of the motion `recognises that the establishment of an embassy in Croatia would greatly enhance economic, cultural and business ties between Australia and Croatia'. This, of course, goes without saying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Croatia experienced some economic problems following the 1991 war, there was <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3676"> uncertainty caused by the problems in Bosnia-Herzegovina between 1992 and 1995, and trade between Croatia and the former Yugoslavia has been difficult, given the historical problems. The war meant repair damages of $20 billion. A large number of refugees also caused significant economic problems. Inflation for 1993 was over 1,500 per cent; however, that was wiped out the following year with better economic management. Croatia has, of course, experienced economic problems, but this should not discourage Australian businesses from pursuing Croatia as another source of trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously, there are markets to be tapped from which Australia can benefit. Croatia is able to compete in a number of areas, including, I understand, electrical engineering, pharmaceuticals and shipbuilding. Within Western Australia, we have a significant shipbuilding industry and I am sure a  business relationship could develop in this field with Croatia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honorary consul in Croatia also assists in promoting Australian commercial interests. The consul has been appointed by Austrade as Australian trade correspondent for Croatia and Slovenia. The consul pursues Australian cultural, educational, scientific and technological interests and promotes general public awareness of Australia through, for example, the dissemination of information material about Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition foreign affairs policy, prior to the last election, stated that the rapid economic growth of eastern Europe offers the potential for significant Australian investment, especially within infrastructure and trade. I note that Croatia is embarking on a privatisation program&mdash;lucky Senator Kernot is not there to stop that&mdash;and Australia should be looking to these markets for investment opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia, over the past number of years, has pursued, in a trade sense, Asia with some vigour&mdash;and there is, of course, the traditional trading partners of the United States and Britain. However, with the end of communism in eastern Europe, there are, of course, greater opportunities for Australia to explore. Our policy stated that we would, in government, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> give high priority to promoting Australia in Europe as a major hub from which to conduct and headquarter business operations in the east Asian nations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that Croatia&mdash;indeed, all of the former Yugoslavia and eastern Europe&mdash;will become increasingly successful economically as they divest from socialist policies. Australia cannot forgo the opportunity to capitalise on these economies as they evolve. While Croatia may not become an economic powerhouse, it has a great association with our nation. While on the face of it an embassy would appear to be a preferred scenario, the government believes the current arrangements for Croatia, while falling short of the convenience of full resident representation, are working reasonably well and serve Australia's interests fairly satisfactorily. The government keeps Australia's overseas representation under review very regularly, and it is possible that at some time in the future a post in Zagreb might be considered&mdash;and I certainly hope that will be the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, just as a note of sarcasm, can I ask the member for Moore whether this motion is an underhanded way of perhaps getting an ambassadorial post&mdash;I believe that Croatia is very  lovely at any time of the year&mdash;so as to return the seat of Moore back to the Liberal Party, which would be a preferred option. I seriously commend the member for Moore on his work for his Croatian constituents and on his commitment to this issue. </PARA>

<PARA>Last month all Australians were shocked and appalled by the violence which flared in the United Nations' buffer zone in Cyprus. As honourable members will recall, two Greek Cypriot youths were killed by Turkish Cypriot forces and more than 50 people were injured in what were among the most violent incidents in Cyprus since the Turkish invasion of northern Cyprus back in 1974.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rights and wrongs of these most recent incidents in Cyprus will no doubt be debated <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for some time to come. Time today prevents me from going into the detail, but these incidents were, of course, only the latest in a long line of tragic events in Cyprus. That is the sad reality of the situation in Cyprus. Now, more than 22 years after the Turkish invasion of the northern half of the island, Cyprus remains artificially and tragically divided&mdash;a continuing division which imposes a terrible humanitarian cost on the communities of the island.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the past 22 years, I have taken a keen interest in the cause of justice for Cyprus. Cyprus is not just a small island in the eastern Mediterranean; it is also the ancestral home of some 50,000 to 60,000 Cypriot Australians. As honourable members will be aware, the Cypriot Australian community is the second largest Cypriot community outside of Cyprus itself. Australia has benefited enormously from the contributions to our national life from Cypriot Australians, both Greek and Turkish. They have profoundly enriched the multicultural fabric of our society. Australia owes an enormous debt to the Cypriot Australian community, and it is incumbent upon us to do all that is possible to work for a just and lasting settlement in Cyprus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The world, it can be said, has ignored the calamity of Cyprus for too long. Old conflicts such as the Cold War and more recent conflicts such as the Gulf War, Bosnia and Somalia have distracted the attention of the United States and Europe from the problem of Cyprus. Some might say it was convenient for the United States and its allies to be so distracted because of the strategic value of Turkey on the southern flank of NATO during the Cold War and, in 1991, as a partner in operations against Iraq. It is one of the hard lessons of international politics that nations are often guided by considerations of strategic and economic interests. That said, however, we must never lose sight of fundamentally important questions of justice, of right and wrong; and, in the case of Cyprus, a just settlement is very long overdue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not the first time a motion concerning Cyprus has been submitted to this House. The honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) moved a similar motion on 25 November 1995. What I want to do today is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3678"> to reaffirm the place of Cyprus on the agenda of the Australian parliament, to call on the Australian government to continue to fight for the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus as the only legitimate authority on the island, and to take a lead in efforts to promote a just and lasting resolution of Cyprus's problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After more than 22 years, it is time for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Cyprus. A divided Cyprus can never be condoned. The issue of Cyprus is the longest running sore in European politics. Nicosia, with its barbed wire and brick walls bisecting its streets, is the only divided capital remaining in Europe. It is an absolute disgrace that the international community has allowed Turkey to occupy over a third of Cyprus for more than 22 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Honourable members will recall that in 1974, after the coup against the Makarios government, Turkey invaded and occupied northern Cyprus. A puppet government was established declaring itself to be the Turkish Federated State of Cyprus&mdash;the TFSC&mdash;which was recognised only by Turkey. In 1983 the TFSC unilaterally declared independence as the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus&mdash;the TRNC&mdash;again recognised only by Turkey. The so&hyphen;called declaration of independence was condemned by the United Nations. Nearly 13 years on, the self&hyphen;declared TRNC remains unrecognised by anyone except Turkey, with an unsavoury reputation as a haven for international fugitives, an economy that is at best limping along, and a garrison of some 35,000 heavily armed Turkish troops.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More than 150,000 Greek Cypriots in northern Cyprus were expelled from their ancestral homes by the Turkish invaders. In more recent years we have heard the term `ethnic cleansing' applied in relation to Bosnia and other countries. Greek Cypriots were `ethnically cleansed' from northern Cyprus and Turkey then set about repopulating the north with people from Anatolia. More than 70,000 settlers have been imported from Turkey to colonise the north, while it seems that some 45,000 Turkish Cypriots have left the island. Over 1,600 Cypriots are considered to be `missing persons', their <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> unresolved fate the cause of continuing deep distress to their next of kin and relatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since 1968 successive UN secretarys&hyphen;general have attempted to facilitate dialogue between the two communities on Cyprus. The so&hyphen;called `Set of Ideas' was developed in 1992 as an outline for settlement. That framework was endorsed by the United Nations through Security Council resolution 939 of 29 July 1994, which affirmed that a Cyprus settlement must be based `on a State of Cyprus with a single international personality and a single citizenship, with its independence and territorial integrity safeguarded'. Such a state would compromise `two politically equal communities in a bi&hyphen;communal and bi&hyphen;zonal federation', such a settlement excluding union in whole or part with any other country or any form of partition or secession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Originally both communities on the island, Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot, signed off on this approach, but it is fair to say that Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot community have since moved increasingly towards a position of seeking to perpetuate the division of the island through the establishment of two sovereign states. UN Secretary&hyphen;General, Boutros Boutros&hyphen;Ghali, has on a number of occasions expressed his exasperation at the lack of cooperation and goodwill demonstrated by the Turkish Cypriot leadership in resolving the island's problems. In his most recent report to the Security Council, the Secretary&hyphen;General noted that while the Turkish Cypriot leader professed a commitment to a federal solution, on a number of issues, `notably sovereignty and political equality, his position remained at variance with Security Council resolutions'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A viable settlement in Cyprus must involve compromise. The Secretary&hyphen;General has commended the President of the Republic of Cyprus, President Clerides, for his willingness to explore possible trade&hyphen;offs in the search for a just settlement. The Secretary&hyphen;General has urged the Turkish Cypriot leadership to respond in a commensurate manner. For its part, the Security Council continues to express its concern at the continuing impasse on Cyprus and the absence of any progress towards a political solution. The council has <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3679"> also repeatedly expressed concerns about the modernisation and upgrading of military forces on the island and `the lack of progress towards a significant reduction in the number of foreign troops in the Republic of Cyprus'. The withdrawal of all foreign forces from Cyprus and the demilitarisation of the island is unquestionably an essential element of any viable settlement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has long been actively involved in efforts to negotiate a peaceful and just settlement on the island. The question we must now consider is: what can our country do to further assist international efforts to promote a just and lasting resolution of Cyprus's problems? In his statements on the recent tragic events in the UN buffer zone, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) expressed an essentially passive attitude. Such an approach fell well short of what was required in the circumstances. I do not wish to score a partisan point on what is, I believe, a bipartisan issue. But I must say that supporters of the cause of justice for Cyprus were surprised by the absence in the minister's statements of any explicit reference to the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Cyprus. That was, I think, a most unfortunate omission by the minister. Australia must not stand idly by while the present deadlock continues the suffering of the people of Cyprus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is presently seeking a non&hyphen;permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. This is a bipartisan objective and I am sure all members share the hope that the Australian campaign will come to a successful conclusion at the forthcoming meeting of the UN General Assembly in New York. If we do secure the honour of a seat on the Security Council, our nation will incur the corresponding obligation to do all that we can to assist in the resolution of issues before the council. In the case of Cyprus, Australia will be both obligated and ideally placed to contribute positively towards a settlement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Cyprus is expected to start negotiations on joining the European Union in 1998, with accession possible as early as 2002. This is a process that would be made much easier if a solution were found to the island's problems first. For decades there has been a perception <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of Cyprus as the sort of international problem that just never gets solved. Circumstances are now changing. For the first time perhaps, broader international forces are beginning to push for a resolution of the island's problems. There is now a window of opportunity for the world to bring justice to Cyprus. And Australia must do everything it can to advance this process. We are duty bound to do this. It is not just a matter of justice. The question of Cyprus must not be ignored. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to support the motion before the House today on the Cyprus issue. However, before I address the substantive matters in the motion, I wish to report to the parliament that last week, as part of a group of Australian parliamentarians, I visited the Australian Federal Police at the United Nations protected area at the now disused Nicosia International Airport in Cyprus accompanied by the High Commissioner to Cyprus, His Excellency John Sullivan.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to report that this brave group of 18 men and two women, led by Commander Barry Carpenter, who is on his fourth tour of duty in Cyprus, are in excellent spirits, despite the fact that some of them recently came under fire. We have every reason to be immensely proud of each and every one of them. They go about their duties unarmed at all times&mdash;and do Australia proud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say at the outset, as I said in my speech on the Cyprus issue in this parliament on 21 August last, that any reflection I make on the actions of the Turkish government on this specific issue is distinct from any reflection on the Turkish Cypriots, whom I respect highly and who have demonstrated their peaceful and harmonious co&hyphen;existence with the Greek Cypriots for a very long time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, I make this observation: the invasion of Cyprus by Turkey 22 years ago was ostensibly to protect the interests of the Turkish Cypriots, who numbered at the time some 125,000 people. Yet 22 years later, the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3680"> Turkish Cypriots have dwindled in number to some 60,000 to 80,000. In other words, the Turkish Cypriots who were able to get out&mdash;that is, some 50,000 people or nearly one&hyphen;half of those who were able to leave&mdash;in fact did so. They were systematically replaced by an equivalent number, imported by the Ankara government, of settlers from eastern Turkey who have neither the social nor cultural background of the Turkish Cypriots, much less the Greek Cypriots, with plainly evident consequences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of the military invasion by Turkey of the northern part of Cyprus, some 200,000 Greek Cypriots were uprooted, never again to see their homes or their personal belongings. Many of them fled ahead of the Turkish army, leaving all behind. The Turkish government further incensed the world community by unilaterally renaming the invaded sector of northern Cyprus&mdash;which amounts to nearly 40 per cent of the island&mdash;as the so&hyphen;called Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, or TRNC. To this day, no other country of the world community of nations recognises the so&hyphen;called TRNC, other than the Turkish government itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to reiterate in this the Australian parliament that the Australian government has made its stance on this matter perfectly clear&mdash;that is, Australia recognises the Government of the Republic of Cyprus as the only legitimate government of Cyprus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our delegation to Cyprus met with the President of the Republic, Mr Glafcos Clarides, on 30 August and, during our discussions, I asked the President what he would like to see occur as a short&hyphen;term, first step towards a peaceful resolution of the issue. His response was just one word&mdash;`demilitarisation'. President Clarides then gave me a copy of his letter to the Secretary&hyphen;General of the United Nations dated 17 December 1993 in which he outlined a six&hyphen;point peace plan, the cornerstone of which is demilitarisation of the island. Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave of the House to table that letter.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Regrettably, that offer was rejected by the Ankara government. During <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> my visit to Cyprus, one of the deepest impressions made upon me, apart from my visits to the `green line', was my visit to Deryneia on the outskirts of Famagusta&mdash;the ghost city of Famagusta which is now deserted&mdash;where two young Greek Cypriots were murdered by the Turkish occupying forces, a matter which I referred to in my speech to this parliament on 21 August last. We were welcomed by Mr Andreas Ponyouros, whose calling card read:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mayor of the Occupied&mdash;by the Turkish troops since 1974&mdash;Town of Famagusta</PARA>
<PARA>We were met as well by his deputy, Mrs Sophie Phitidis, and their council colleagues. Mrs Phitidis told me of her personal experience as one of those 200,000 displaced Greek Cypriots who fled before the Turkish troops. She told me that she and her family ran as fast as they could when the Turkish army began shelling and machine&hyphen;gunning the city. They left everything behind&mdash;their house, their business and all their personal belongings&mdash;and all the while thinking that sanity would prevail and they would be able to return the next day. That was not to be. Now, 22 years later, she and her family can only look at their former home through binoculars. They lost everything.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The city of Famagusta, situated on a wide strip of sandy beaches, was prior to the Turkish invasion one of the great tourist resorts with five&hyphen;star luxury hotels and accounted for more than three&hyphen;quarters of the tourists to Cyprus. No&hyphen;one lives there now. The buildings are all clearly visible from the tower on the Greek Cypriot side, but it is a ghost town.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The mayor told us that, following the Turkish invasion, he was sent as the Cypriot Ambassador to the United Nations for some 9&half; years and during that time was coopted as a member of the United Nations committee to define `aggression'. That was specifically for the purposes of international law. The definition, as agreed to by the United Nations and as paraphrased by the mayor&mdash;and I quote his words&mdash;was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any foreign country that invades another country and stays there against the decisions of the United Nations and International Law is an aggressor. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3681"> </PARA>
<PARA>The message and question he posed, which he asked me to convey to this parliament and which I wrote down word for word, was this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the Security Council decided to send Iraq out of Kuwait they sent armies there and threw Iraq out of Kuwait, because Iraq was the aggressor by invading Kuwait. What about Turkey's invasion? Why these double standards?</PARA>
<PARA>Why indeed, Mr Deputy Speaker?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That situation in that part of the world is highly volatile. In fact, I went with the delegation to Greece and we were briefed by the Greek Military High Command and the Minister for Defence. The Chief of Staff of the Greek Military High Command told me himself that Greece was only three hours away from war with Turkey over the Imia island incident which was only just averted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A peaceful and just solution must be arrived at sooner rather than later. Many highly placed people I met, especially during my visit to Greece, spoke about deadlines for a peaceful resolution. Mr Deputy Speaker, the alternative is too horrible to even contemplate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not with any great joy that I stand before the House today to second the motion that has been put forward with respect to the situation in Cyprus by the honourable member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith (Mr Brereton). I am very pleased to be able to second the motion but it is of course in tragic circumstances that we are debating this issue once again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I spoke in the debate at some length on the Cyprus question in this House on 23 November last year on the motion that was moved by the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay). The broad issues that were canvassed in that debate still remain. In addition to the broad historical picture, the unresolved injustice with respect to Cyprus, we are now contemplating recent outrages which have saddened the international community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> We are now contemplating the fact that two young men, cousins I understand, are now dead as a result of perhaps over&hyphen;exuberant but relatively innocent acts of incursion into the buffer zone. One of them was beaten to death by Turkish troops and the other was shot. They were in the act of, in one case, attempt ing to take down the Turkish flag and, in the other case, simply entering the zone. These men were Anastasios Isaak and Solomos Solomou.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the case in such situations that both sides of the conflict will have their stories. But I think we need to acknowledge in this House that the response of the Turkish troops and the Turkish government to these incursions was out of all proportion to the nature of the incursions. The fact that these two young men have been killed in this situation should be deplored by all members in this House. It was a gross overreaction which has been compounded by the very unfortunate subsequent statements by the former Turkish Prime Minister and now Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller, who stated that the Turkish community&mdash;or the Turkish government indeed&mdash;would `break the arms' of anybody who sought to touch or lay hands on the Turkish flag.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the past, at the outset of this conflict, the apparent threat of Greek Cypriot attempts to unify Cyprus with Greece was the justification for Turkish invasion and occupation of over one&hyphen;third of Cyprus. If that justification ever had any merit at all, it certainly no longer has any substance whatsoever and there can be no excuse for the Turkish government to continue to avoid allowing international resolution of this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is unfortunate that the many diplomatic efforts that have been going on under the auspices of the United Nations, with people such as Joe Clark and Richard Holbrooke, appear to have ground to a halt, and one can only hope that the recent incident will actually revive these attempts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important in the broader context to remember that there are still over 1,600 Greek Cypriots officially listed as missing; that there are still thousands of families who are unable to return to the houses they owned in the villages where they lived and grew up. What was 18 per cent of the former population of Cyprus&mdash;or people on their behalf&mdash;have control of about 37 per cent of the land, and the Turkish republic of northern Cyprus is of course not recognised by any other nation in the world other than Turkey.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3682">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen ethnic cleansing in the area to a degree which can only be measured by the fact that there are now fewer than 500 Greek Cypriots left in the Turkish zone. The United States, the United Nations, the Commonwealth, the Australian government and both sides of this House have continued to call for, as this motion does, a fully independent Cyprus, a unified Cyprus with a federal state and a bizonal and bicommunal accommodation such as that which preceded the invasion, was drawn up in the 1950s and 1960s and, in my view, gave appropriate and very generous minority rights to the Turkish Cypriot minority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The motion has called for the withdrawal of Turkish troops, full demilitarisation, the return of refugees and the withdrawal of Anatolian settlers. I support the right of Cyprus to enter the European Union and I think that it is appropriate for this House to endeavour to put further pressure on Turkey through this motion to allow for international resolution of the issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is sadly ironic that this issue is before people in the media at the moment through the excellent ABC series <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Final Cut</EMPHASIS> and that at this time we should see these tragedies occurring. I can only hope that Tassos Isaak and Solomos Solomov have not died in vain and that their deaths, outrageous as they are, will remind the world that, while we are agonising over issues like Northern Ireland, the Middle East and many others, there is still one major outstanding injustice that remains unresolved in the world. It is something that Australians and the rest of the world should pay more attention to: the injustice in Cyprus, which continues to this day. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The small island of Cyprus, just over one&hyphen;tenth the size of Tasmania, has a history of being caught in the crossfire between larger powers. Cyprus testifies to the truth of the old adage that `when elephants play, the grass gets trampled'. The island was occupied by the Greeks, Phoenicians, Assyrians, Egyptians, Persians and Romans&mdash;all before the birth of Christ. In the past two millenia the trend has continued, with England, Venice and Turkey all assuming control at one time or another.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I regard the United Kingdom as a most benign imperial power, it must share some responsibility for the present strife. Indeed, Richard the Lionheart invaded Cyprus during the Crusades in 1191 and auctioned the island to Guy of Lusignan, then dispossessed the King of Jerusalem, after the crusading orders of the Knights Templar were unable to meet his price.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the conclusion of the Russo&hyphen;Turkish war in 1878, Turkey traded Cyprus to British administration in order to gain a buffer zone against the perceived threat of Russian aggression. On Disraeli's return to London, he boasted: `I bring peace with honour and Cyprus'&mdash;indicating that Cyprus was still a chattel to be bought and sold among the great powers and a pleasing addition to the empire upon which the sun never set.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also arguable that the United States could have done more&mdash;that President Nixon and Henry Kissinger could have resisted the Turkish invasion in 1974. But the US appeared to support the Athenian backed junta against Archbishop Makarios in 1974 which precipitated the Turkish invasion. America's need for Turkey's support in the wider cold war context meant that little international will existed to defend the interests of Cyprus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More recently, we have seen some encouraging moves towards peace over the past three years, but the past three months have seen a terrible regression into hostility and violence.

The state government of New South Wales is carrying out the process of the RACAC review and is absolutely determined to shut down timber towns&mdash;an issue which should concern our only rural member, as he calls himself, on the opposite side of the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The increase in the amount of timber to be set aside from the allocated amount will not only lead to the loss of sawmills in the area but lead to the loss of essential services in the area.

I urge all members to support a timber towns in crisis rally on Sunday, 13 October if they genuinely care about the rural constituents in Australia. Thank you.</PARA>

I am pleased to advise this parliament that a young resident of my electorate of Greenway, Mr Gunjan Aggarwal, has qualified for the Australian Student Prize for his achievement in the 1995 higher school certificate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth government has been awarding the Australian Student Prize since 1990 to recognise outstanding academic achievements in this final and most demanding year of secondary education. The certificate goes to the top 500 students in Australia and the top 150 in New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Gunjan's achievement is particularly significant as he came with his family to Australia from India only 4&half; years ago. Initially, he attended school at De La Salle, Ashfield. When his family moved into my electorate at Seven Hills, Gunjan attended James Ruse Agricultural High School at Carlingford.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With an outstanding mark of 99.8 per cent in the 1995 higher school certificate, Gunjan is a worthy recipient of the award. Gunjan is currently studying medicine at the University of New South Wales, where I am confident he will distinguish himself and bring great credit to himself and his family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was pleased to be advised by the minister of Gunjan's success and to have the opportunity of organising a community presentation. On Tuesday, 16 July I was delighted to use my new electoral office for the first official function to make this community presentation to Gunjan.

It includes the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Business Council of Australia, the Minerals Council of Australia, the Metal Trades Industry Association, the National Farmers Federation, the Australian Chamber of Manufactures, the Australian Hotels Association, the Confederation of ACT Industry, the Housing Industry Association, the Motor Traders Association, and so the list goes on.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason that I emphasise this is that for the 13 years that the Labor Party was in power it was very fond of quoting large and small business organisations, when they thought they could, in support of their industrial relations strategy.

The truth is that, when you add up what they will be opposing, in addition to those measures, it amounts to $19 billion over four years. Your list did not include ATSIC, the ABC and the labour market programs. You will be opposing $19 billion of measures over four years. If we added in the Telstra sale, which we have a mandate for, as you did in relation to headlines, it amounts to $27 billion over four years.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is absolutely no doubt&mdash;and it does bear constant repetition&mdash;that one of the areas where there would be an adverse consequence if the opposition were to be successful in hacking away at the savings achieved in the budget is the area of interest rates. It is important that we isolate the completely fraudulent position of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the shadow Treasurer, because the area of difference, even in the shadow Treasurer's own words, is not a matter of principle but really a matter of the speed with which one achieves fiscal consolidation. The shadow Treasurer, be it remembered, is not suggesting there is no link between interest rates and the size of the budget deficit. In his determination and his anxiety yesterday to say that I was engaging in blackmail in saying that he was playing with interest rate fire in trying to hack so much out of the budget deficit reduction strategy, the shadow Treasurer then went on very quickly to say, `Oh, but of course there is no link in the short term.'</PARA></TALK.START>

I know they had no mandate from the Australian people about anything in the 1993 election in contradistinction to the mandate we have from the Australian people to sell a third of Telstra and to reform industrial relations.

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8E4">Dr WOOLDRIDGE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I am on top of absolutely everything to the exact detail. The fact is there have been 23 premium increases by health funds since this government came to office. That compares with 48 registered health funds. Health funds can be expected to increase their premium about once a year. That is the average. The 15 major health funds around Australia&mdash;that is, two for every state, except three for Victoria and four for New South Wales&mdash;over the past 12 years, have had 174 increases approved by you, which works out at exactly one a year. So what we are seeing here is the normal increase in health fund premiums that flow through.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other side of this is that there have been claims by the opposition that premiums were going through the roof, or that there were massive increases in premiums. There have been massive increases in premiums on only one occasion in recent years, and that was in the financial year 1991-92, when health fund premiums went up 17 per cent on average right across the board when you were the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that the average premium increase under you for the four financial years 1991 to 1994-95 was 8.75 per cent. The average premium increase of those 23 funds that have so far put up their premiums on the basic table is 6.1 per cent. So not only are they absolutely on track; they are running at a lower rate of increase than you were able to average over the last four years. So there is absolutely no basis to any of the beat&hyphen;up that has been going on over the last two weeks.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Wide Bay for his question. The last five years of Labor government were characterised by a dependency on debt and deficit. General government debt increased from $17 billion in 1990 to $96 billion. If there had not been any adjustment in this budget, general government debt would have increased to $120 billion by the year 2000, an increase of over 600 per cent in just on 10 years.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Lindsay for her question. I am aware of the very serious unemployment situation which exists in western Sydney and, of course, this situation reflects the consequence of the failure of the previous government to create additional employment opportunities. It is an extraordinary fact that over the last six years fewer than 100,000 additional full-time jobs have come into existence in this economy. With over 800,000 unemployed, over the last six years under the policies of the previous government fewer than 100,000 additional full-time jobs have come into existence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This failure of job creation lies at the heart of the problems facing unemployed people, particularly long-term unemployed people. But another element in this, of course, was the failure of Working Nation. The evaluation of Working Nation commissioned by the member for Hotham found that two-thirds of the long-term unemployed people participating in the programs failed to find employment at the end of their participation, and many of these returned to the short-term unemployment list. This is a shocking indictment of the policies of the previous government.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the program on new work opportunities&mdash;the member for Hotham, the $2 billion man, should listen to this&mdash;$500 million of that $2 billion was spent on a program which left eight out of 10 participants unemployed, and every dollar of that came out of the pockets of Australia's families. What we are seeing is a replacement of that sort of irresponsibility with a responsible approach to creating more jobs and to helping the long-term unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps the single greatest failure of Working Nation, however, was that job referrals for long-term unemployed people actually fell by eight per cent during the period of Working Nation&mdash;and this is according to your own evaluation study. This was supposed to be a program that was actually in place to help long-term unemployed people. Your unbalanced approach to these labour market programs actually increased the aversion amongst employers to hiring long-term unemployed people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we have the most appalling failure there. The government has put forward a program for helping long-term unemployed people which will ensure that community groups and the private sector will be able to make much more effective links between the needs of unemployed people and the actual jobs which exist in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key element of the government's programs is that we have put forward a budget and we have put forward legislation, particularly the workplace relations bill, which are absolutely essential to creating more job opportunities. You are setting out to try to sabotage that legislation in the Senate. The fact is that unless the workplace relations bill is passed, unless the budget is passed, the opportunities for long-term unemployed people in this country will continue to be undermined by the sort of irresponsible policies which you have supported in the past and which apparently you are going to try to continue from opposition.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism. Why has the government announced it will be ending access to research and development taxation concessions to R&amp;D partnerships or syndicates? Is the minister concerned about the impact on genuine R&amp;D projects?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EI4">Mr MOORE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government is very concerned about research and development. It is one of the most important aspects that industry looks to for future development. As a consequence of that, when we came to government, we instituted a review of the R&amp;D programs which were then in place. Besides the overall mismanagement and misdirection of those programs, we did find that the syndicated R&amp;D in particular resulted in massive financial outcomes without necessarily good research and development outcomes. Ninety per cent of the syndicated programs had a guaranteed financial return with no ongoing commitment to research and development. It was therefore not cost effective and certainly did not meet policy objectives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One example of syndication gave $12.6 million worth of tax benefit for a total investment of $5.6 million in research and development. Quite clearly, this is not good enough. A BIE review of research and development indicated that the program should be closed and that a grants scheme should be put together. As a consequence of that, on 23 July the Treasurer and I put an end to the syndicated R&amp;D system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of a new program announced in the budget, the Start program, some $340 million over four years was introduced. This is a program of grants, loans and interest rate subsidies which are of great benefit to genuine research and development. When you add this to the existing program, it means that over the four-year period some $520 million will be made available for research and development within the area.</PARA>

So to suggest that there is some sort of failure of a system because no application has been made over that eight&hyphen;day period is plainly ridiculous.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have established an inquiry into the operation of the private health insurance industry. We responded to a number of suggestions from a number of groups that such an inquiry be conducted. The fact that we are conducting that inquiry does not of itself connote that anything said by the Minister for Health and Family Services is thereby countermanded. The decision that was taken by me to alter the arrangements for approving future increases in private health insurance premiums was taken in consultation with both the Treasurer and the Minister for Health and Family Services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would remind the member for Dobell that in the 13 years that the Australian Labor Party was in power, not one increase in private health insurance premiums was knocked back by the Labor government&mdash;not one increase in private health insurance premiums! In fact, I have been told that the last time an increase was knocked back was in 1974, which is some 22 years ago. Bear in mind that the percentage rate of increase in private health insurance premiums since we have been in office is so far running at a lower rate than the increase that occurred while you were in power for 13 years. Taking those things into account, for you to suggest for a moment that there have been outrageous increases and to argue the proposition, which you appear to be arguing, that just because a government <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3698"> introduces a tax insurance rebate it automatically flows from that decision that there will never again in the future ever be an increase in private health insurance premiums, is an absolutely nonsensical proposition, and you know it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that there are going to be in the future some increases, and they will obviously be unavoidable, in no way destroys the commitment that we made to the Australian public on budget night that the Australian people will get the benefit of the tax rebate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, and I ask: what has been the response to the announcement of the government's Bass Strait passenger vehicle equalisation scheme? What benefits will flow to Tasmania and indeed all of Australia as a result?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="3698" SPEAKER="Sharp, John, MP" NAMEID="AJ4" ELECTORATE="Hume" PARTY="NP" MINISTERIAL="Transport and Regional Development" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AJ4">Mr SHARP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable gentleman for his question. I had on 23 August the great pleasure of launching the government's policy called the Bass Strait passenger vehicle equalisation scheme&mdash;a policy which was designed when we were in opposition and which, of course, now we are implementing in government. I launched this scheme in the presence of the Tasmanian Premier, Mr Tony Rundle, and a number of other community and industry leaders.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of the scheme is to provide a rebate of up to $150 for each passenger with vehicle travelling across Bass Strait. In other words, a $300 rebate for anybody with passenger and vehicle travelling across Bass Strait on the ferry. This is a very significant rebate, bringing down the cost of travel for those people going across Bass Strait to the equivalent of what it would cost to drive the same distance by motor vehicle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scheme, of course, is the fulfilment of an election commitment made by the coalition when in opposition. This policy that we had in opposition has now been delivered within a matter of months in government. Within a matter of months we have delivered this, and we hope that Labor Party members on the other side of the House will support this as it goes through both chambers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">May I say that, despite the catcalls and the criticism of this scheme from those on the Labor side, the scheme has been extremely well received. Not only has it been well <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3699"> received by those in the Tasmanian government and by industry leaders but, within a couple of days of launching the scheme, the TT&hyphen;Line received some 15,000 inquiries on their reservations system from people interested in taking up the benefits that this scheme has to offer. Some 26 operators were required in order to handle all of the inquiries from those members of the public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, the scheme has led to an enormous bonanza. I note that the Hobart <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS> refers to a bookings bonanza that the people of Tasmania recognise has come as a consequence of the federal coalition delivering on its election promises. This bonanza for Tasmania will deliver a boost to the Tasmanian tourism industry and ultimately will lead to a boost in job growth for Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an historic occasion for Tasmanians, as indeed it is for all those people who were on the line, some 15,000 of them, who rang in the first two days of the operation of the scheme. It is a bonanza for Tasmania because of the commitment by the federal coalition now in government to deliver on its election promises&mdash;a commitment from this side of the House to give a real and meaningful boost to the economy of Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All I can say to those people on the Labor side of the House is that this is not going to be the last of the benefits that this coalition government will deliver to the people of Tasmania with the able assistance of the members for Bass and Braddon and our senators. You can see much more benefit being delivered in a meaningful sense by a coalition government. You had 13 years to deliver on these sorts of benefits and you did not deliver anything. Within a matter of months a new coalition government has delivered and given real and meaningful benefit to Tasmania.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. The broad thrust of the government's reforms and the drafting of those reforms have essentially been vindicated <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> by the High Court's decision. Accordingly, whilst there are some minor or technical transitional issues that will need to be addressed from a legal point of view, by and large the thrust of the reforms has been given the constitutional tick by the High Court. We are very pleased about that, and it allows us to proceed with confidence with the balance of the legislation. It is also something of a slap in the face for those on the other side who were questioning the constitutionality of that which we were proposing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is of interest is the reaction from the opposition to the High Court's case. I think it demonstrates some of the building divisions within their side about industrial relations more generally, because the opposition spokesman on industrial relations took from the High Court's decision the prospect that we could thereby change our provisions to use the external affairs power as provided for as a result of this decision and impose or make available the federal scheme to all employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What he encourages us to do is to rely again on the external affairs power. What the honourable member seems to fail to understand is that the reliance on the external affairs power was the No. 1 problem leading to some of the bizarre outcomes that we have under the Brereton reform proposal. What is interesting is not the result of the High Court's decision in respect of what we are doing but the impact that it has in terms of the policy approach of the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had Labor members say to me that what we are doing in respect of unfair dismissal laws is entirely sensible, but we have the opposition spokesman advocating a return to the Brereton scheme. This is evidence of a divided opposition on a key and important policy change which we are introducing. It is, however, not the only evidence of division on the other side in respect of industrial relations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was revealed yesterday that it was none other than the honourable member for Batman who has been running a campaign against the ACTU. The Leader of the Opposition is backing Jennie George, but the anti-Jennie George faction is led by none other than the member for Batman. We now know the reason. This is the sort of stuff that would <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3701"> make Machiavelli proud to know these guys. The reason for this is that he wants Jennie George in here to block George Campbell getting into the Senate. His smiling tells it all; the knowing and acquiescent smile of the member for Batman tells the story.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only is the member for Batman critical generally of the ACTU, particularly Jennie George, and has been running this spiteful campaign which she has publicly attacked; he has been very critical of the ACTU's handling of the riot and the aftermath, as have other members on the front bench. It is very interesting that the ACTU's resolution last week regarding the riot saw the ACTU holding judgment on itself in respect of its reaction to the riot but then declaring itself innocent. Behind closed doors Bill Mansfield, who was the only one prepared to publicly accept part responsibility, was taking a bucket from those associated with the CFMEU and others in respect of the handling of that riot. So we have divisions regarding how they handle unfair dismissal. We have the `get Jennie George into parliament so I can keep the position of convenor of the left wing when it comes up'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Speaker, the ABC television news report on Saturday, 7 September carried a report of a speech that I had made to the New South Wales Liberal Party State Council in St Marys. I believe that that report significantly misrepresented what I had said to the gathering by reason of the fact that it represented to the viewers words as being a direct expression of my opinion <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> whereas, in reality, the words I used were an explicit paraphrase of the policy of the Labor Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me explain where the misrepresentation has occurred. I was addressing the issue of increases in the higher education charge. This is what I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It never ceases to amaze me, for example, that in the tertiary education area, the Labor Party should continue to defend a system which in its pure form, in other words, when there was no contribution sought at all from the tertiary education students, was really a fraud on the working people of this country, because what it basically did was to say to people . . . we are quite happy to take your taxes to pay for a university education that will enrich another section of the Australian community.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Monday, 2 September 1996, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  ran a front page headline article entitled `Federal Police tackle wall of silence over union vote scandal' in which it claimed that the AFP's decision to investigate allegations of vote manipulation in the 1994 election of the New South Wales branch of the postal and telecommunications section of the Communications, Electrical and Plumbing Union directly contradicted a decision by the former Minister for Justice, Mr Duncan Kerr, not to pursue an investigation into the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The facts are a different matter. There was an AFP investigation. On 11 August 1994, the AFP advised me that the Australian Electoral Commission had referred to the AFP allegations made by two candidates and that the AFP had commenced inquiries into the allegations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was subsequently advised that the AFP completed its investigation on 15 September 1994. The matter was later the subject of some correspondence between myself and the then shadow minister for industrial relations, Mr Reith, in which I conveyed to him the outcome of the AFP's investigation and of its advice to me that to reopen the investigation with a view to seeking evidence of alternative offences would in the circumstances be contrary to the prosecution policy of the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make it unmistakably clear that at no time did I make a decision not to pursue the investigation. I, of course, had neither the power nor the authority to give the AFP directions as to its conduct in particular investigations or inquiries. As with all AFP investigations during my term as minister, I was scrupulous not to directly or indirectly interfere with the AFP's properly independent judgments as to the investigations of criminal behaviour. The content of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>'s story so far as it touches on my conduct is entirely false.</PARA>

<PARA>Response to petition presented to the House of Representatives on 6 May 1996 by Mr G.B. Nehl MP relating to the need for more nursing home beds, hostel places and Community Aged Care Packages in the Cowper electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An Aged Care Advisory Committee (ACAC) has been set up in New South Wales to provide the Minister for Family Services with advice about areas which have a high need for aged care services such as nursing home beds and hostel places. The ACAC meets each year to prepare recommendations using needs&hyphen;based planning to target specific areas in the State. Once approval has been granted, these targeted areas are identified in an advertisement published by the Department of Health and Family Services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coffs Harbour and Bellingen Local Government Areas (LGAs) within the Cowper electorate are seen by the ACAC as areas of continuing need for all aged care services, with a shortfall in the level of aged service provision when measured against the stated national targets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Targets are set to achieve a balance of Commonwealth&hyphen;funded aged care services, with the level of service expressed as the number of hostel places, nursing home places and Community Aged Care Packages (CACPs) for every thousand people in an area aged seventy and older. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3716"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Compared with the targets of 40 nursing home places, 50 hostel places and 10 CACPs for every thousand people in this group, service provision in the Coffs Harbour LGA falls short by 31 hostel places, 20 nursing home beds and 29 CACPs. The Bellingen LGA similarly requires 7 hostel places, 5 nursing home beds and 5 CACPs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other areas within the Cowper electorate have an outstanding need for CACPs. The Kempsey LGA falls short by 23 CACPs, the Nambucca LGA by 12 CACPs, and the Hastings LGA by 54 CACPs compared with the stated targets.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I mention to the House the tragic and very alarming circumstance that another soldier was killed in Cyprus yesterday, and a second seriously injured. The governments of both Greece and Turkey have issued statements today, and an investigation will take place as to the precise circumstances surrounding those incidents. I note that the cycle of violence is continuing; it is one which we in this House must hope and pray can be arrested.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we look to the future, there is some basis for encouragement. On UN Day on 21 October last year, some 5,000 Turkish and Greek Cypriots gathered in the buffer zone for an open day and cultural festivities, and 2,000 remained for a concert that evening. A Greek Cypriot handball team visited Turkey in April 1995 and played against Turkey for the first time for that kind of contact since 1974. The government of the Cyprus Republic still pays pensions to the Turkish Cypriots living in the north, and many thousands of Turks live at peace in the Republic of Cyprus as a demonstration that the two communities are quite capable of living together amicably. I note that the Turkish community draws much of its <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> electricity from the south, and the water drunk in Nicosia is often piped from the north.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that in the long run further progress will require greater cooperation in the commercial sphere. Last year President Clerides suggested that the Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots should set up more joint ventures, and recommended that more Turkish Cypriots be allowed to work in the south.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I join in commending the efforts of the Australian Federal Police, noting that one Australian has given his life for this cause: in 1975 Sergeant Ian Ward was killed by a landmine whilst on patrol. I commend the motion of the shadow minister, the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith (Mr Brereton), as a welcome return to complete bipartisanship in Australia's approach to the problems of Cyprus. I pray that, in this age of international miracles, we might overturn the pattern of past centuries, resist the desire to cloak revenge in the garb of nationalism, and see this small island achieve its destiny as a demilitarised, federated sovereign member of the community of nations.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> deplores the continuing neglect of basic human rights by the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) of Burma, including the use of forced labour, arbitrary arrest, the maltreatment of prisoners and the suppression of free speech and legitimate political activity;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> condemns the large scale, arbitrary arrests of members of the National League for Democracy (NLD) which have occurred in Burma over the last week and calls for their immediate and unconditional release;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> rejects the explanation of the Government of Burma that the proposed meeting of the NLD to mark the anniversary of the 1990 election represented a threat to national stability or security;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> reminds the SLORC of the repeated international calls for dialogue between themselves and the NLD, the party which won a majority of the seats at the 1990 elections, as a prerequisite to full reinstatement of Burma within the international community; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> urges regional governments, in particular the Governments of Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia, to use their influence with the Government of Burma to effect the immediate release of those arrested, bring about dialogue between the SLORC and the NLD and encourage improvements in Burma's human rights record.</PARA>
<PARA>How sad it is that, at a time when the world has seen the end of the Cold War, when there is reasonable optimism that the United Nations might function more effectively as a body that can sit in peaceful deliberation on divisions between countries, we still see a world where divisiveness&mdash;either on ethnic or purely power based grounds&mdash;abounds and where, tragically, military dictatorships, corruption in high places, drug running and the prejudice of the majority against the minority are rampant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In no country in this region is this more so than in the sad country of Burma, which is so close to Australia and the ASEAN countries with which Australia is increasingly adopting not only a fraternal link but very much a partnership politically, commercially and in every other way. It is of great concern to this House that the State Law and Order Restoration Council of Burma&mdash;SLORC, as it is known&mdash;still persists in denying basic human rights to a large percentage of its populace and, above that, ignores totally the very significant&mdash;80 per cent&mdash;majority achieved by the democratically elected government in the election of 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not for Australia to lay down or prescribe the circumstances by which governments should be established in other countries. It is not really for us to pontificate on the circumstances surrounding the election of a government, for all that we might feel strongly about it. It is very much for Australia to express concern about the product of a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government abusing the authority which it exercises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This motion is intended to do three things. The first is to commend Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and her supporters for the way in which they have persisted, in spite of absolutely impossible odds, to assert the rights to freedom and democracy and human rights in that sadly torn land. Secondly, through this motion, we as a parliament seek to say to the ruling junta, the State Law and Order Restoration Council of Burma, that we believe the policies they are pursuing make it difficult for countries like Australia to engage in any sort of reasonable relationship with them. I will to go into some aspects of that in a moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not just saying these things for the sake of Burma's relationship with their neighbouring countries or, indeed, Australia. We are saying them because Burma, in my view, has no chance of recovering from the awful mess it is now in unless there is a fundamental change in attitude&mdash;a recognition of the rights of the minorities; a recognition that the policies they are pursuing are quite contrary to good governance and quite contrary to the basis upon which most of us believe normal relations should be pursued. The third issue is the extent to which Australia should take actions in order to implement that point of view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have mentioned in the motion the neglect of basic human rights and large scale arbitrary arrests. With respect to both those issues, since this motion was first put on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>, sadly there have been many other abuses. I believe something like 260 followers of Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy have been apprehended. Of those, we are told that about 30 have now been gaoled for seven years. I am told that the nature of people who are incarcerated in that country is such that inevitably those people will be tortured. Those people are going to be treated in a way that we would regard as abhorrent, yet here we are in a quandary because we know that the countries that surround Burma, particularly Thailand but also Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia, are engaged in a range of approaches to make Burma part of ASEAN and to bring Burma <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3718"> back into the world. The fundamental issue&mdash;and it is a very difficult one for a country like Australia&mdash;is whether we should try to bring Burma back into the world through trade, tourism and encouraging a greater openness of Burmese society or whether we should say that we should have no contact with them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were very fortunate that the Prime Minister of Burma visited Australia a few weeks ago. In discussions with him and his colleagues&mdash;and I understand he is a cousin of Aung San Suu Kyi; we were all impressed with him&mdash;we found that his difficulty is that he left the country after the 1990 election. For those who do not know, his is a fascinating story. He left his wife and unborn child. He has not seen his daughter since he left the country. He is trying hard to muster support for the National League for Democracy and for his government by travelling the world and talking to other people to try to encourage a better understanding of the ways of Burma.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The National League for Democracy believes that there should be virtually no contact. They believe that we ought to have sanctions against the government of Burma in the same way sanctions were used against the apartheid government of South Africa and therefore, hopefully, produce a result which might lead to the lifting of those policies which are endemic to the rest of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With all due respect to the wonderful lady and noble laureate, Aung San Suu Kyi, I do not think she is in quite the same position as Nelson Mandela. It is not for us to judge. The point is: how do we best achieve that relationship? I think we have to maintain contact; so I do not agree with the National League for Democracy in that regard. I understand that there are many in this parliament and, indeed, many in Australia who feel we should go further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that the Australian Council for Overseas Aid, which is the peak foreign aid body in Australia, called on the government to harden its policy on Burma by actively discouraging trade with the military regime. There are certainly many who feel with respect to the new gas pipeline which is being constructed between Thailand and Burma that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> action needs to be taken to ensure that it does not proceed in the face of the appalling human rights abuses which have already occurred there but also that there might be a recognition that that will provide an economic lifeline for the SLORC government of Burma which would enable that government to feel more entrenched and less likely to recognise democratic pressures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As many will know, a case is being tried at the moment at the headquarters of UNOCAL in Los Angeles to determine whether the joint venture should be allowed to proceed. There is a claim for unspecified damages for Burmese killed, displaced or forced to work on what looks like the 1996 replica of what was known in the war years as the Death Railway. Some would call this pipeline the `Death Pipeline'. Whatever the circumstances, it is a major concern for us all that the government of Burma seems to be moving headlong and is willingly prepared to continue its course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That brings me to what I see as the main substance of the motion, and that is point 6: we have to urge governments, particularly those of the ASEAN countries, perhaps through the ASEAN regional forum but certainly in our bilateral contacts with them, to adopt a far more rigorous attitude towards the government of Burma, particularly the SLORC administration. That military regime is endemic to what we all see as progress economically, progress politically and progress towards the introduction of democratic institutions in our region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend very strongly this motion to the parliament. It is a very important question for us. It is fundamental in our region that people do what they can to advance democracy and concern for the individual. That is what this motion seeks the State Law and Order Restoration Council in Burma to do, at the same time recognising the enormous contribution Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has made not just to democracy but to lifting the plight of her sorely affected people.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me say that Labor welcomes this opportunity to restate its grave concern at the current political situation in Burma. I know that concern is shared by all members of this House representing all political parties and, indeed, the Independents who sit in the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for New England (Mr Sinclair) has spoken this afternoon about the continuing efforts of the Burmese military junta, SLORC, to suppress the democracy movement, the National League for Democracy, led by Aung San Suu Kyi. The continued revelations of appalling abuses of human rights in Burma, which include arbitrary arrest, detention without trial, torture, the use of forced labour including the forced labour of children, and the suppression of free speech and legitimate political activity leave absolutely no doubt that SLORC is a regime far beyond the pale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">SLORC's record of gross abuse of the most basic human rights has been comprehensively documented by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch/Asia. SLORC's shameful record is undeniable and inexcusable. Its leaders are masters of murderousness, brutality and viciousness. Their actions deserve the emphatic condemnation of this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The motion before the House expresses support for the efforts of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi to negotiate democratic change in line with the expressed will of the last free and fair election in Burma, back in 1990. The motion goes on to remind SLORC of the repeated international calls for dialogue between them and the NLD&mdash;the party which, as the member for New England pointed out, won the majority of seats in the 1990 election&mdash;as a prerequisite to the full reinstatement of Burma within the international community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the present lack of dialogue between SLORC and the NLD, and SLORC's continuing actions against members of the democracy movement, including the arbitrary arrests of NLD members, no member of this House would dispute the imperative that there be absolutely no slackening of international efforts to pressure that regime in Burma to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> respect human rights and accept democratic processes of change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former Labor government worked hard to advance the cause of democracy and human rights in Burma and we are determined, from these opposition benches, to continue to do all that we can to support a peaceful movement towards an open and democratic political environment in Burma. In this sense we welcome the actions of the Australian government in conferring an honorary award as a Companion of the Order of Australia on Aung San Suu Kyi in recognition of her outstanding leadership and great personal courage in the struggle to bring democracy to Burma. Her leadership has been of the highest order and, in every sense, is comparable with the outstanding leadership that saw the regime of apartheid broken in South Africa. The nomination of that honorary award was made by the former Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All Australians recognise and applaud Aung San Suu Kyi's resolute commitment to promoting democracy and human rights in Burma and to improving the lives of the people of Burma. She is in every sense an extraordinary woman, an inspiration to millions of people and an international symbol not only of the Burmese people's desire for democracy but of the whole struggle to secure respect for human rights&mdash;a struggle that continues around the world today. The final paragraph of today's motion urges:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . regional governments, in particular the Governments of Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia, to use their influence with the Government of Burma to effect the immediate release of those arrested, bring about dialogue between the SLORC and the NLD and encourage improvements in Burma's human rights record.</PARA>
<PARA>Certainly, as the member for New England has said, the countries of ASEAN unquestionably occupy a critical position in the international efforts to bring about a restoration of democracy in Burma. Together with the countries of South Asia and China, they are Burma's neighbours and Burma's partners, and any international campaign to bring pressure to bear on SLORC is to a large, though by no means total, measure dependent on their support.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3720">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be unfortunate, may I say, if the impression were given that the burden of the international effort to restore civil and political rights in Burma should fall on these nations alone. In this regard, while the opposition supports the broad thrust of the motion before the House today, we would point out that it falls far short of the resolution adopted by the Senate on the occasion of Aung San Suu Kyi's birthday on 19 June this year. The final paragraph of that resolution reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . calls on the Government to put the SLORC on notice that potential trade sanctions must be on the agenda if civil and political rights are not restored.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>The question which this parliament and the Australian government must face sooner or later is: what is the next step in relation to Burma? Where do we go from here? The member for New England spoke about where you draw the line. I think we should be asking: what next?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">International efforts to date to persuade SLORC to engage in constructive dialogue with the NLD and to take some real steps towards the restoration of civil and political rights and freedoms have borne no fruit whatsoever. Sooner or later, the international community will face the question of whether, effectively, to walk away from Burma&mdash;to leave things as they are and do nothing more&mdash;or whether to apply greater pressure to induce SLORC to accept a peaceful movement towards the establishment of democratic institutions and processes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unquestionably, SLORC's hope is that the world community, including countries such as our own, will take the former course of action&mdash;or, rather, inaction&mdash;that we will lose interest and eventually walk away. Doubtless, similar hopes are held by those commercial interests which hope to profit from expanded trade with Burma&mdash;more often than not involving direct dealings with SLORC&mdash;including access to the country's mineral and timber resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a complex situation which calls for careful judgment. It is often argued that without broad international support, and support from regional countries in particular, any attempt to apply pressure to SLORC will have no effect. The question which Australia <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will have to face is whether, in the absence of any real movement towards democracy in Burma, SLORC are the sort of people decent Australians would want as trading partners. Talk, after all, is cheap but it is not enough when it comes to questions of basic human rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) recently commented, in relation to the issue of human rights in Tibet, that `business is business'. The opposition categorically rejects that approach. As I said in the motion on Cyprus earlier today, it is one of the hard lessons of international politics that nations are often guided by considerations of strategic and economic interests. That said, we must never lose sight of fundamentally important questions of justice, of right and wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to Burma too, this parliament and the government must weigh the cause of justice and human rights in the balance. International affairs must never be reduced to simple calculations of strategic advantage or the trade balance. Fundamental questions of respect for human rights, of the promotion of democratic institutions and liberties, must never be left off the ledger.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to future developments in Burma, the opposition calls on the Australian government to maintain the embargo on the export of defence and defence&hyphen;related goods to Burma; and, in concert with like&hyphen;minded governments worldwide, to apply pressure on SLORC to release immediately all political prisoners, to desist from all practices of forced labour, and to respect basic human rights and freedom of expression. We further call on the government, to use the key words of the Senate resolution I referred to earlier, `to put SLORC on notice that potential trade sanctions must be on the agenda if civil and political rights in Burma are not restored'.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support what the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) and the honourable member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith (Mr Brereton) have had to say in the debate on this motion, particularly the need for constructive engagement by ASEAN nations and the wider international community. I also want to say something very briefly about the issue of trade sanctions raised by the honourable member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be fair to say that, to the generals who run Burma, Miss Suu Kyi is a fearsome opponent. They hoped that six years under house arrest would sap her courage, dull her political instincts and blunt her popular appeal. After her release in July last year&mdash;charisma and determination intact&mdash;she at first appeared uncertain about how to carry on her struggle for democracy. Her party, the NLD, as has been indicated, had been weakened. The junta had succeeded in getting the economy moving to a certain extent. Several South&hyphen;East Asian leaders had visited Rangoon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, in late June&hyphen;early July this year, Miss Suu Kyi let the generals know in no uncertain terms that she had found her way, and they were clearly unnerved by the prospect. At the time, she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has become evident that my release does not mean any progress in democratisation. However, the NLD has won the support of even more people.</PARA>
<PARA>She went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is difficult to make predictions about the future of politics. We continue to discuss the realisation of democracy no matter how many days, months, years or decades it takes.</PARA>
<PARA>She finished by saying&mdash;an important point, I think:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Time is not an important factor.</PARA>
<PARA>A couple of her friends from the student movement going back to 1988 made these points in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Far Eastern Economic Review</EMPHASIS>  also in June:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The confrontation between Suu Kyi, with her young followers, and the SLORC, with its state apparatus and powerful war machine, may appear to be politically hopeless. After all, a bunch of dissidents <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> heading towards the prison doors does not make a very promising impression. But the SLORC is not winning the day. For one thing there is an entire generation willing to sacrifice itself by standing up to powerful leaders. For another, the state dominated economy, with its hyperinflation and sluggish low value added foreign investment, is heading towards crisis.</PARA>
<PARA>The article went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Burmese saying goes: SLORC risks acting like a stupid crow that rides a floating dead elephant.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>It is important to point out to the House that, despite eight years of struggle and thousands of lives being lost, the democracy movement has failed to dislodge the military rulers in Burma. That said, however, the generals themselves have failed to silence Miss Suu Kyi. I think it is important to briefly outline for the benefit of the House historically what has happened, going right back to 1962, under General Ne Win, to 1988 where we had the very large measure of civil unrest, to 1989 where SLORC promised political reforms and multi-party elections but at the same time placed Miss Suu Kyi under house arrest for endangering the state; and then to 1990 when, as we heard earlier, the NLD won 392 of the 485 parliamentary seats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very important that we all support this motion&mdash;in particular, the need for constructive engagement. On the point of trade sanctions, I remind the honourable member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith of what the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) said in July, and reaffirmed with the Burmese foreign minister in meetings prior to the ASEAN regional forum, that we would look as though we were about making loud, symbolic noises which the SLORC could comfortably dismiss and we would achieve nothing because the trade between the two countries is minuscule. At the same time, we should work at it. It gives me a lot of pleasure to support all elements of the motion before this House today. We look forward to bipartisan support.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to commend the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) for bringing this motion before the House. Those of us who have maintained a continuing interest in Burma over many years had hoped that the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3722"> situation in that tragic country had improved, but the sad reality is that, far from improving, in many respects the authoritarian regime of SLORC has ensured that things are even worse. I note with interest that this motion has bipartisan support. One welcomes that, but indeed how could it be otherwise when one looks at Burma's regime today?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Glancing through newspapers and glossy magazines, one is made aware that this year there are many articles extolling the charms and beauty of Burma and accompanied by glossy photographs. There was even one recently in the Qantas journal. This is the Year of Tourism in Burma, and people from throughout the world will be enticed to visit this beautiful but tragic country. But beneath the beauty of the gold pagodas lies a frighteningly brutal regime and, as many have indicated, Burma has been gripped with terror and frightening brutality for many years. The land, far from being a paradise, is a country where people's human rights and dignity are trampled under a jackboot, ruthless organisation. I wonder how many of the tourists who make it to Burma will see, from the increasing number of luxurious Western&hyphen;funded hotels, the real situation in that country or whether they will see only what is around these luxurious hotels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year I served as a member of the Human Rights Subcommittee into human rights and progress towards democracy in Burma, but any progress towards democracy has indeed been very slow. SLORC has taken the usual uncompromising, hardline view concerning the opposition in Burma. When we talk about the opposition in Burma, what one should always be aware of is that in the 1990 elections the opposition&mdash;or what is called the opposition&mdash;had a considerable win. The party, led by Aung San Suu Kyi, actually won 392 of the 486 contested seats, but the SLORC blocked the party from taking power and, as we know, put the leader of the party under house arrest, where she remained until recently. Especially during these last couple of weeks, many other members of the party, the National League for Democracy, have been arrested and put in prison and undoubtedly will be tortured.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is always a question for countries throughout the world today, as we all become more and more aware of human rights, that we should be judged by the way we treat our minorities. Rest assured that the way the minorities are treated in Burma is a matter of shame for the Burmese military regime, those entrenched generals and other military people who have been in power there, who have grabbed power and have been illegally holding it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Far from being a paradise, unfortunately Burma is a country where people's humans rights and dignities are trampled under foot. There is a trade in human misery as well. While I was on the subcommittee we were told about the trade in young girls taken from the hill areas and often taken into Thailand. We all know of the AIDS epidemic throughout Asia&mdash;indeed, throughout the world&mdash;today. These young people are infected with this dreadful disease and are then just sent back into the area. There is also a trade in drugs. Quite frankly, the military, the SLORC, in Burma are trafficking in human misery, and we should have no part of that. You do not have to take my word for it or that of people like me. Respected organisations such as Asia Watch and Amnesty International have well documented the trade in human misery that is going on in Burma today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are sometimes told that we should not interfere in other countries and that nothing must be done or said to impede business opportunities. This is the same argument that was used in relation to South Africa. Had we and the rest of the world not said anything, I have no doubt that the apartheid regime would still be in place in South Africa. I particularly commend the right honourable member for New England for paragraph (6) of his motion, which states:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree entirely with what the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) has said, and I certainly support the motion moved by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). There is hardly a more repressive or violent regime in the world than the military government in Burma, and it deserves complete condemnation by this parliament. Burma's government is comparable in many respects to the government in North Korea under Kim Il Sung and now his son Kim Jong Il. It is comparable in a lot of respects to Uganda when under Idi Amin or Iraq today under Saddam Hussein. Those comparisons are hardly flattering, and they are not intended to be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In many respects we sometimes tread a little softly, as the member for Throsby suggested, because there is perhaps some reluctance to interfere in countries. But we are not interfering by doing some of things that he suggested and indeed some of the other things that have been suggested&mdash;discouraging trade and discouraging tourism. I realise that there is a fine line sometimes between having an adverse effect on the people who live in those countries and actually making the point to these sorts of regimes that we, who live in a privileged situation in civilised countries, will not do business with them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are countries such as Australia which should take every possible step to bring these sorts of violent regimes to heel, and we have within our power the tools to do that. Burma is a very poor country, amongst the poorest in the world, and the government of Burma has attempted to open up its economy to some extent and to attract foreign investment. The one thing that many of these poor countries need and want from us and from other wealthy countries is foreign investment.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Burma's attempt to open up its economy to trade is equivalent to the Vietnamese government's approach. But Burma has been somewhat less successful, despite the fact that the communist regime in Vietnam is in many respects very little better than the one that exists in Burma. There are serious abuses of human rights in Vietnam, particularly in relation to the persecution of Christians and Buddhists there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ultimately foreign investors make judgments about risks and returns. Neither they nor governments in many cases are particularly concerned about the morality of doing business with these types of countries. It seems to me that it is often a hypocritical situation that, on one hand, we attempt in some way to condemn abuses of human rights while, on the other hand, we go full&hyphen;on doing business with and even encouraging tourism in these countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Burma there are, as has already been said in this debate, serious restrictions on freedom of speech, freedom of assembly and privacy. I do not have any doubt that we should be using the tools that we have to make these people aware of our concern. The use of economic sanctions is a powerful weapon to be used against countries such as Burma, where human rights abuses are judged to be extreme. The use of this weapon is quite blunt; but history has shown, as a number of people in this debate have already pointed out, that it can be effective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have some concerns about the granting of observer status at ASEAN to Burma. This regime has apparently, as you would expect, been emboldened or encouraged by the respectability which participation in ASEAN deliberations confers. I realise that the motion particularly calls upon other members of ASEAN to actually use their influence to make some impression on the regime in Burma. Japan is not mentioned specifically in the motion, but I do not believe it has been particularly helpful. It obviously is in a position to use its powerful good offices; it has a history of ties with Burma. However, it has been out of line with other Western nations who have taken a much more hardline stance on Burma.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3724">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is hard to say that it is a pleasure to speak to this motion, although I am fully in agreement with it. In fact I wish that the atrocities occurring in Burma were not occurring. So, on that basis alone, it is a necessity for people in our position to stand up and to put our case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had a connection with Burma over some years, having had the privilege of living there for 18 months or so a few years ago. I want to use that experience to put a certain historical aspect to this whole motion and to the whole debate of what we as a country should consider doing when we try to deal with the atrocities and the regime of Burma.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I was living there I saw evidence&mdash;long before any 1990 election, the development of the SLORC and the welcome evolution of the democracy movement in Burma&mdash;of the sort of oppression that an enormously ugly military dictatorship can bring to the people of a country. I saw the ordinary people not being able to get access to medicine. I saw them not getting access to proper education. I saw a health system that was an absolute disgrace to be seen in any part of this world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was 15 or 18 years ago. What we have to keep upmost in our mind is the period of time the people living in Burma have suffered under this regime and how long we, as a free and democratic nation in this region, should be happy to sit back and watch. I do not believe we are happy to sit back and watch. I think the time has come well and truly when we need to start to consider certain things that we are able to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last few months, in fact just after being elected to this place, I had the honour of meeting a representative of the Committee for Restoration of Democracy in Burma who made a point of coming to see me and introducing himself. I was very impressed by the work that such a group and its members do in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> raising awareness throughout the community at that grassroots level of the problems in a country like Burma and the work that they are trying to do to bring to the attention of those outside the country what may be needed to amend the actions of that government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More recently I was able to attend a dinner held by the Australian Foundation for Democracy in this region. I had the honour and the privilege of meeting Prime Minister Dr Sein Win, the Burmese Prime Minister in exile following the elections, referred to by other speakers. Whilst I agree with one of the earlier speakers in relation to the difficulty that a man in his position has had in taking himself out of the country, by the same token I do not believe that he had much of an option. We have seen what has happened to Aung San Suu Kyi and we have seen the actions of the military dictatorship against her followers. I think that Dr Sein Win is a very brave man indeed to remove himself from his own family and his own country with a mission in mind to go around the world and to spread the word of what is really required to amend the actions of the ruling regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has taken the actions of those within Burma who have stood against those years of oppression to bring the world's attention to the atrocities being endured in that country. Should history keep repeating itself&mdash;that is, that that dictatorship, that military regime, continue in its actions that have, as I have said, been perpetuated for many years and have become worse in recent years; there is no doubt about that&mdash;then I believe it is incumbent on us as a nation to have at the top of our agenda a list of what actions we should seriously be considering to try to amend this terrible thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course there is ongoing dialogue&mdash;and I would not for any moment suggest that that is not a worthy cause&mdash;and there are trade sanctions and visitor visa sanctions. There is a range of things we should consider. I do not think the size of our trade need be considered when we think about whether or not we should go down that path. I am not necessarily saying that we should do that tomorrow. What I am saying is that it is about time that the ruling regime in Burma understood the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3725"> view which the rest of the nations around this region and the world in general hold of their actions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Foremost in our minds must be this: as a free and democratic nation, for how long do we continue to witness the actions of this regime before we start to consider further actions of our own? My admiration absolutely goes to Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and her followers in Burma. I do not think we could even start to imagine what they are putting themselves through and the line they have drawn in the sand for themselves in standing up for what they believe should be the open, free, democratic nation of Burma&mdash;a return, in fact, to the days when Burma used to be called `The rice bowl of South-East Asia'. It is not integrally a poor nation but a rich one that has been downridden by a terrible dictatorship.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the motion moved by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). Burma's State Law and Order Restoration Council, SLORC, was born out of the repression of human and political rights. On seizing power in September 1988, SLORC violently suppressed pro-democracy movements. Its unleashing of security forces resulted in the death of up to 1,000 people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since then, SLORC has continued its violations. Its arbitrary arrests, imprisonments and tortures have been well documented by Amnesty International, the UN Human Rights Commission and the US State Department. SLORC continues to disregard democratic processes and ignore the overwhelming 1990 election victory of the NLD, the National League for Democracy. SLORC's behaviour is not a case of neglect of human rights but an entrenched pattern of suppression and violence. Token signs of improvement, such as the freeing of Aung San Suu Kyi, have been rapidly followed by a return to repression.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The large scale arrest and imprisonment of NLD delegates over past months is the most recent manifestation of the cycle of repression. The regime's justification for the arrests that the NLD's May conference represented a threat to Burma's internal security and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> stability has as little credibility as the Burmese foreign minister's remarkable assertion that there were no political prisoners in Burma. The fact is that repressive regimes ultimately generate their own dynamic of political instability by continuously suppressing legitimate political activity and movements towards democratisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A real concern for security and stability makes it imperative that there be meaningful dialogue between the NLD and SLORC on Burma's political and constitutional evolution. As Aung San Suu Kyi has stated, the dialogue should be without preconditions. The opening of such a dialogue between SLORC and the NLD would be the first step towards the reinstatement of Burma within the international community. But it is only a first step. The dialogue needs to go hand in hand with greater measures of political democratisation and steps to end SLORC's repression. In particular, there does need to be a release of political prisoners and an acceptance of the legitimacy of political activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Burma's tradition of foreign policy isolation has mitigated the impact of international condemnation and pressure on SLORC. World opinion will not of itself remedy the situation in Burma, but it is critical that that pressure be maintained. Australia has taken a number of steps to this end, which have been outlined, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer), in a meeting with his Burmese counterpart, expressed Australia's strong concern about the lack of democratic reform, about continued confrontation and lack of dialogue, and about the continued detention of political prisoners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The closer relationship being established between Burma and ASEAN members offers new opportunities for some positive outcomes. The ASEAN policy of constructive engagement with Burma has been prompted by a complex of security and economic interests. It is seen by ASEAN members that establishing a degree of contact and interaction with Burma maximises the possibility of exercising a positive influence on SLORC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The potential is undoubtedly there, but it will be realised only if the pursuit of economic and strategic interests is matched by a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3726"> strong commitment to securing advances in democratisation and human rights. It is important that regional governments highlight the need for reform, both political and civil, to SLORC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recognise that these nations do have important geopolitical and economic interests in Burma. However, the fact is that the continued repression and lack of progress towards democratic reform are antithetical to Burma's long-term political stability and economic advancement. If regional nations' development of stronger links with Burma do not go hand in hand with the promotion of human and political rights, there is a strong likelihood that SLORC will interpret the extension of relations as a vindication of repressive policies that are both unacceptable and short&hyphen;sighted.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There can be no doubt that the problems which have been referred to by a number of speakers&mdash;and, I note, with some passion on both sides&mdash;are still continuing. For instance, in August, U Win Htein, the private secretary of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, was sentenced to seven years gaol. That was after he was released last year from a six-year gaol sentence. There is no doubt that his arrest and sentencing by way of a political trial was for his political rather than criminal activity&mdash;something which all Australians would regard as abhorrent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A short time before that&mdash;in June of this year&mdash;Mr Leo Nichols, a supporter of Ms Suu Kyi, died in Rangoon's Insein prison. I congratulate the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) for making the following statement on Mr Nichols' death:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Nichols' death once again focuses our attention on the brutal practices of SLORC. The political nature of his arrest, the harshness of his sentence and the conditions of his incarceration lead me to renew calls for the Government of Burma to reform its human rights practices.</PARA>
<PARA>Those human rights practices to which the minister referred were considered in some detail in a report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade which investigated practices in Burma, such as secret surveillance; the removal of any <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> form of meaningful freedom of expression or freedom of the press; the removal of any concept of freedom of movement or freedom of assembly; the removal of freedom of religion; the prevalence of detention without trial and, indeed, substantially political detention; the existence of conditions in prisons involving torture, cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment; and extra judicial summary or arbitrary executions&mdash;and we heard various accounts from speakers today of the numbers, as far as we can surmise, who have suffered that ultimate fate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, the existence of forced labour is renowned&mdash;it is, effectively, slave labour. There are no basic labour rights. They are a long way from adherence to any reasonable standards promulgated by the ILO. We heard both here today, and as indicated and examined in the report of the committee, of the existence of the trafficking in women and an increasing prevalence of AIDS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I agree with the motion, which has been given some significance in being moved by the father of the House, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). However, I also note and agree with the suggestions of the shadow foreign minister, the honourable member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith (Mr Brereton), that it does not really go far enough. It is a little like the days of trying to break down Al Capone's hold on Chicago and his illicit trade by sending an auditor around and requesting that he gently disclose his books and release his resources. Because you are dealing with entrenched corruption of the most vicious kind, change will not happen without some force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note, for instance, that Ms Suu Kyi herself believes that further engagement with Burma should be conditional on democratic reform, and I think that must be the case. We have really got to the stage where we must up the ante. Any further trade or any assistance with Burma should be based upon their move towards genuine democratic reform, otherwise we will have more than a bushfire in our region&mdash;we will have a disaster which simply will not be in our international interests, our national interests or the interests of democracy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the motion moved by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). The first part of the motion refers to what has gone on in Burma or Myanmar under the State Law and Order Restoration Council, SLORC, and is typical of many military dictatorships which, having taken over the country, tend to enforce their occupation and their rule in that country by incredibly oppressive means that people can think of.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1995 <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Europa World Year Book</EMPHASIS> states that between 1990 and 1995, 80 elected representatives had either died, been exiled or were in prison. That was of a fairly elected government which, as we know, never came to rule in Burma because of the activities of SLORC which refused to acknowledge the election despite the fact that the NLD achieved 59.9 per cent of the vote and 80 per cent of the seats in the assembly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The military dictatorship did not believe that this would happen and believed that with the detention of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi they would return to power. They underestimated the effect she had in the provinces despite her internment in her house and believed that they would retain government. Having found they would not retain government and that the NLD had taken power fairly and unequivocally, they simply ignored the results of that election and have since set up a constitution in which they endeavour to entrench the role of the military in Burma now and into the future. SLORC had two aims: firstly, to entrench the military as the rulers in Burma; and, secondly, as part of that, to destroy the NLD.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The right honourable member for New England mentioned our dilemma: how do you achieve the goals that you want&mdash;through the `constructive engagement' that has been suggested, certainly by the ASEAN countries, as a more useful means of negotiating with SLORC or through condemnation and refusal to trade and trade embargoes? It is a difficult question because there are signs that SLORC is modifying its behaviour to some extent inasmuch as Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has been released from house detention.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also hope, expressed in the economic press, that as SLORC liberalises its attitude, as it moves away from socialism, it will also liberalise its rule in that country. I fear, though, that this may be a vain hope when we look at what is happening in the countryside. I might point out that farmers already have to give over one&hyphen;third of their crop to the military at two&hyphen;thirds of the going price.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But worse things than that have happened. My colleagues have mentioned the enforced labour that takes place when people are taken from their homes and forced to work for the military, either carrying supplies or labouring on infrastructure projects. There are personal and witness reports of people being forced to carry supplies and being beaten when they fail because of the weights involved. There are witness reports of some of these people actually dying by the roadside. For infrastructure projects even young children are taken from their homes and forced to work for the military.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly this government does not seem to have human rights as its centrepiece. It is hoped that, as it has been admitted to ASEAN, and as it continues economic dialogue with the rest of the world, this government, which has ruled by torture and suppression, will not continue on this path. But as my colleague the member for Kooyong (Mr Georgiou) has said, there is a concern that this will give them a mark of approval without actually changing the way they rule the country.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to enter this debate on Burma at two levels. I thank the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) for raising this matter in the House. One of the problems facing members of this parliament is that we take much of what happens in our democracy for granted. We have had a change of government and there was not a policeman in the street and there was no tank outside the parliament. It is almost impossible for us to comprehend the degree of oppression that runs right through Burmese society under the operation of SLORC.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3728">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For some five years I have had the privilege of serving as the Asia&hyphen;Pacific representative on the Human Rights Committee for Parliamentarians of the Inter&hyphen;Parliamentary Union. We have had evidence brought before us constantly of parliamentarians being imprisoned, tortured, murdered, separated from their families and subjected to all sorts of degradation and solitary confinement. Continual representations have been made to SLORC. We have asked for inspections, but we have never received the compliment of a reply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that, for a parliament with our tradition, apart from the broad question of human rights there is the question of the rights of parliamentarians who are being subjected to this treatment for no other reason than that they were democratically elected to represent the hopes and aspirations of their people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Should anyone believe that things might be improving, I might point out that on 20 May 1996 some 258 NLD activists were arrested, among them 235 elected MPs, of whom 91 have been identified by name by Amnesty International. We are dealing with a regime which has all the techniques, all the cruelty and all the oppression that characterised Hitler's Germany, the one distinction being that it is basically operating in a one nation state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a parliament, how do we react to that? We can pass resolutions, but the IPU has passed resolutions, as has the United Nations, year after year and, frankly, they have been ignored by SLORC. It seems to me that one should have regard to the fact that before the United States Congress at present there is a bill which proposes very severe trade embargoes on dealings by American companies and citizens with Burma. I do not know what the fate of that legislation will be, but it does seem to me that it is not enough for us as parliamentarians to express a general view on this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would commend to the government, given the unanimity which seems to be across parties in this chamber, that as a first step it would not be at all harsh, oppressive or a basic interference with the private enterprise system should the government say that any <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> company registered in Australia&mdash;and I am talking also about international companies&mdash;which deals with SLORC will not be considered as capable of tendering for any government project. It is as simple as that. It is narrow and it is defined. Although our trade with Burma is limited, on what basis should we close our eyes to the daily abuse of human rights and say that we may exculpate ourselves with a debate such as this?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that we would all like to do something practical. We would all like to strike a blow for the Burmese people and their elected representatives. I do not believe it would be harsh or oppressive were this parliament and the government, in a united way, to take the lead and say, `Right, if you want to tender for a government contract and you think you can deal with this democratically elected government on the one hand and get the benefit of government tenders, then you cannot go across and deal with SLORC and close your eyes to their abuses of their own people and of their elected parliamentary representatives.' I believe that is a course which should commend itself to this House, but it should be seen as a first step. Unless something like this occurs, SLORC will go on ignoring us as they have ignored the United Nations, the IPU and other international bodies. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I wish to bring the attention of the parliament to the circumstances surrounding announcements made last week by the Australian Sports Commission in respect of the funding of sports within Australia, the concern that has been expressed by many of those organisations that have had funding <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3729"> totally withdrawn and the concern that many Australians genuinely have about decisions that have been mooted by the ABC board to withdraw major sports throughout Australia from broadcast.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget which was delivered by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) some three weeks ago has seen a cut of $6 million imposed on the Australian Sports Commission&mdash;$5 million in its running costs and an additional $1 million in the two per cent commitment which all government departments and agencies have had to make. There has been, however, a sweetener inasmuch as, with much fanfare, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) announced that the Olympic funding towards the year 2000 Games in Sydney would be maintained, as would the maintain the momentum sports program&mdash;$135 million for the Olympic effort and $35 million for the maintain the momentum program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is absolutely marvellous news. It puts in place and maintains programs which the former Labor government started, certainly in respect of both of them. I admit that the maintain the momentum program was to cease in the course of this year, although there was no guarantee that that would not have been funded again had we been re&hyphen;elected to office. Certainly, the moneys that had been allocated under that program had come to an end this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, what this decision means in respect of the Australian Sports Commission has to be viewed more widely in the philosophy associated with sport, because as a result of this decision the Australian Sports Commission has been placed in a very invidious position. It has been told by the government that it has had funds cut and that, as a consequence, it is going to have to make economies. So the Sports Commission has been placed in the invidious position of having to say, `These sports are going to have funds cut, these are going to have funds totally withdrawn and some others are going to face an uncertain future.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The disturbing thing is that the decision was taken last Thursday by the Australian Sports Commission board and a press conference was held later that day at which the chairman <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the Sports Commission announced that certain economies were going to have to be made. What he had to say, which came out in a subsequent press release, was that the commission would no longer fund minor sports with a low funding base and low levels of participation; that funding to peak sporting bodies and umbrella groups would be phased out during 1996&hyphen;97; that management subsidies would no longer apply to the comparatively wealthy sports such as Australian football, rugby league, cricket, tennis, rugby union and one or two others; that there was a series of other programs in the commission's participation programs area that would be considerably revamped under a new integrated approach which would lead to significant administrative and program savings; that there would be cuts made to the Australian Institute of Sport and to intensive training centre programs&mdash;and so it goes on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact was that a list was subsequently produced which showed that a whole variety of sports were going to have to go cold turkey, that all their funds were going to be withdrawn in one fell swoop. That list included: darts, fencing, fishing, gliding, handball, hang gliding, ice hockey, korfball, modern pentathlon, sporting shooters&mdash;I remind the honourable minister that the first two gold medals we won in the Olympic Games were for shooting&mdash;and a range of other similar sorts of sports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Associated with that was the withdrawal of funding for the Confederation of Australian Sport, the Australian Schools Sports Council, the Australian Society of Sports Administrators, ACHPER and Sports Medicine Australia&mdash;all gone in one fell swoop. As I suggested to you, funding is also going to be reduced particularly in some of the so&hyphen;called wealthier sports like rugby league, motor cycling, motor sports, cricket, Australian football and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Time does not allow me to go into some misconceptions associated with some of that, but I do want to point out right from the word go that my concern is manifold but in particular is about the fact that the Sports Commission has been given that poisoned chalice by the government of having to say to sporting <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3730"> organisations that they are not going to fund them all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me be the first, however, to say that I do not believe that every sport in this country should be funded. There is no doubt that certain criteria have to be established and we have to say that funding for all sports should not be expected and cannot be anticipated. However, the way in which the sport for all programs have been attacked by this government&mdash;and, as I say, making the ASC bear the responsibility for it&mdash;is to be regretted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I give two quick examples of that. The first is in recreation fishing. Recfish Australia, which represents that sport, put out a press release last week, hopping right into the government about this decision. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To have operating funds completely withdrawn from an organisation that represents about 5 million Australians, with an industry worth in excess of $3 billion annually, is absolutely outrageous.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This drastic and unbelievable move is totally unacceptable and is not what the new Federal Government had indicated and promised both pre and post the March election.</PARA>
<PARA>That is one example of false criteria being used, according to Recfish Australia, for saying that funding should be withdrawn.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other example, which is more extraordinary, though, and of which there has not been a resolution, is netball. The Australian women's netball team are the world champions, undisputed, yet there is some uncertainty as to whether the AIS program in netball will continue. Yes, they have received a letter from the Australian Sports Commission saying that they are going to continue to have funding for their programs&mdash;that is, for all the work in administration, of coaches, development squads and so on&mdash;but whether there is going to be a program at the AIS for Australia's arguably premier women's sporting competition is going to be debated at some future date. I think that is an absolute outrage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a question raised as to whether we are trying to pick a few winners in this and that there is no commitment to all sports. As I say, the Confederation of Australian Sport might argue that you must question <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> whether the right mix does exist at the AIS at this stage and whether the right sports continue to be funded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some might argue, for example, at having gymnastics. Yes, we did quite well in terms of our participation at the last Olympic Games where we finished 10th&mdash;the best we have ever done. But in a country like ours where we have not had a background in gymnastics, where we have brought in Chinese coaches and so on&mdash;and they have done extremely well, not for one minute am I saying that they have not&mdash;the question can be raised by some: do we need to continue with a program like that at the AIS or should some other sport that we have some real talent and some ability in take its place in the future?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing is that it is not just for 2000 that sports should be developed. Let us face it, for the Olympic Games in Sydney in the year 2000, because we are the host we have right of entry to every sport that is on the agenda. But as a nation of 18 million people, do we need to be in every sport at the Olympics in 2000 in Sydney? I think not. It is a question then of looking at what we can do for the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, it comes down to the philosophy of sport:  a balance between Olympic and non-Olympic sports; the provision of adequate funding; and the question of whether the private sector can be involved. I know that the minister said something about this in Tasmania recently. Quite honestly, does the minister really expect that private funding is going to come along and support sport in this country where we need to maintain healthy lifestyles, where we need to develop role models, where we have to have elite sports as well as broad participation sports? I do not think that is right. They are not going to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Look what happened after 1988 with the Australian women's hockey team. They won a gold medal in Seoul. They got back and two weeks later their major sponsors said, `Ta&hyphen;ta, see you later, you no longer fit into our corporate program.' What sort of example is that to set for the future?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other comment is about drugs in sport. Much is said about Australia's role in this <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3731"> area, but contained in the budget is in fact a cut for the research laboratories that carry out the testing procedures for drugs in sport. Did anybody tell anyone about that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I guess the most ludicrous thing that we have heard right across the board is the decision apparently being considered by the ABC to stop the broadcast of rugby league throughout country New South Wales and, indeed, throughout the whole of the country in favour of minor AFL competitions&mdash;not the major AFL but some minor AFL competitions. That has to be one of the most short-sighted examples of a decision that is being contemplated ever. I hope they are reconsidering it. I have called on the Prime Minister to intervene in that. He is a great sports lover. I ask him: how would he feel about his beloved St George in games against the Steelers not being broadcast right around Australia? I think he would be as outraged as I am. This is a great travesty of justice and one which I will be speaking much more about in the future. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<TIME.STAMP>(4.47 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My grievance is directed to the unworkable, inequitable child support system. I raised this issue in my maiden speech. The vast majority of people coming to see me in my electorate office have a problem with this system. Not one of the non-custodial parents wanted to avoid paying maintenance, but they wanted to pay a reasonable and fair amount.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not shirk from the proposition that it is every parent's duty to maintain his or her child. Furthermore, I believe that every person has some capacity to pay maintenance. Even people on unemployment benefit can pay something. As a mother said to me recently, even $5 a week would help her children go on that occasional excursion. The non-custodial father on unemployment benefit can surely afford $5 a week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The vast majority of complaints about this system come from non-custodial fathers, couples in second marriages who have children from first marriages and custodial mothers trying to get maintenance from fathers who are running small businesses. In <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> my opinion, this legislation is a shocking piece of social engineering. I cannot, in all conscience, support such an unworkable, divisive and socially depressing scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, the system is not one of maintenance; it is in reality a distribution of income. Under section 4(2) of the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989, one particular object of the act is to ensure:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> that children share in changes in the standard of living of both their parents, whether or not they are living with both or either of them.</PARA>
<PARA>Now what does that mean? For a non-custodial parent on $45,000 per year with two children aged five and six, it means that child support of $12,150 per year is payable. Quite simply, it does not cost $12,150 a year to support two children aged five or six or, indeed, $24,300 for an income of $90,000 per year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thus, how does the child share in this illusory standard of living? There is no accountability as to whether the money is directed to sharing in changes in the standard of living of the children. In other words, who ensures it goes towards the standard of living of the children rather than the standard of living of the recipient?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another `purler' in the act. Another particular object of the act is to ensure:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> that persons who provide ongoing daily care for children should be able to have the level of financial support to be provided for the children readily determined without the need to resort to court proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA>Last week Mr and Mrs Buttenshaw came to see me. Mrs Buttenshaw is seeking support for two children of a former marriage. Her second husband also has children by a former marriage. He is on a salary and his child support payments are deducted from his salary. They basically live from week to week. On the other side, her former husband is in small business. He has consistently avoided paying child support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I took this matter up with the Child Support Agency on their behalf. Mrs Buttenshaw commenced proceedings in the Family Court for maintenance against her former husband. These proceedings were dismissed for want of jurisdiction. To my horror&mdash;since I was not <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3732"> aware of this change&mdash;the Child Support Act had denied her access to the courts. In my discussions with the Child Support Agency about enforcement, I had made inquiries as to what they proposed to do about enforcement in that case. I have not had an answer yet, but Mrs Buttenshaw has. She was told the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Child Support Agency would not take him to court unless they knew they would get money out of him. As they did not know if he had any they didn't want to waste their money if they didn't think that they were going to get any out of him.</PARA>
<PARA>What an extraordinary statement this is! First, the Child Support Act denies Mrs Buttenshaw access to the courts to sue the former husband for maintenance; then the Child Support Agency makes this absurd statement to her denying her access through the agency to the court. So the agency in the administration of the act is effectively denying one of the act's objects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from this incongruity, to me, as a former practising barrister, this indicates absolute naivety on behalf of the agency. Of course nobody has any money until they are brought before the court and an oral examination is commenced about their assets. Suddenly, either at the door of the court or during the course of the proceedings, it emerges that they do have money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a fundamental principle of all litigation in matters of this nature that you will never get anything out of anybody by threatening to take them to court. If the person is in business, the last thing he wants to do is be absent from his workplace for a day in the courts where he has to swear on oath as to the truth of his financial affairs. It is guaranteed the quickest way to get a settlement, and that is what Mrs Buttenshaw wants&mdash;some money out of her former husband to pay for the cost of rearing his two children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Buttenshaw example is a classic example of the inequities of the system both ways&mdash;their family is basically on the edge living from week to week because the system drags an exceptionally high amount of money out of Mr Buttenshaw, but does not get any for Mrs Buttenshaw, and Mr Buttenshaw is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> supporting those two children as well as his wife and himself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further examples are legion. One constituent out of the blue had a demand for $280 to be paid within seven days, including a penalty, because of an incorrect assessment two years previously. Let me say that the notion of penalties in this delicate area is totally unacceptable. Interest is one thing, but a penalty is simply that; it is in the nature of a criminal sanction for doing something wrong when the person who has made an estimate of his income has simply made an incorrect, but honestly incorrect, estimate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The system punishes people if they are thrifty or work harder. The harder they work, the more child support they have to pay. The harder they study and the more they advance themselves, the more child support they have to pay. This principle is inconsistent with the principles of the party to which I have the honour to belong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once again, to say that a child is entitled to share in the standard of living of a parent is classic social engineering. There are many decent and honourable parents who say that a child is not entitled to share in the income of the parent. Many parents I have met have become wealthy through thrift and hard work. They want to impart those laudable traits to their children. Their reaction to their children is, `You go and work and study hard then you will appreciate the rewards of that hard work.' This establishes moral values and norms consistent with a healthy society. We are not establishing a healthy society if we encourage a system that allows children to get something for nothing or that purports to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is tearing families further apart. One of the principal complaints is that the system is so inequitable that it drives wedges between parents, between non-custodial parents and their children, and sometimes between the children themselves as they get older and choose to live with one or other parent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another aspect of the farce in the system is the review process. I have seen documents put up as evidence in these proceedings which are totally false, concocted and, if produced in a court, would result in a charge of swearing a false document and/or perjury. However, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3733"> people in this process are not only getting away with submissions based on false documents but causing review officers to act on the false evidence to the detriment of the other party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To take one example of many, a constituent informed me that his former wife had married an anaesthetist. His former wife's income was $15,000 per year. As the House is aware, anaesthetists are not on the basic wage. In the review process, the wife claimed that half of her income of $15,000 went to the rental on the property that she and her anaesthetist husband were sharing. This was accepted as part of her legitimate expenses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My constituent had his child support level raised. He is now in a situation where he has been forced to give up work because of the system. I have a number of examples of people who have in utter despair given up work and gone on unemployment benefits because the system was so crushing. The system, as I have said, punishes the hard worker and frequently rewards the wrongdoer. As one constituent said to me, `Marriage is the only contract where the wrongdoer on breach can be rewarded by the child support system.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my view, the only fair solution to child support is through court ordered assessment. Each case must depend on its own set of facts and own individual nuances. In my practice as a barrister, I believe this system worked well compared with the current one. Certainly, in matters of enforcement, some wider powers are needed. I believe that a failure to pay court maintenance orders should amount in some circumstances to a contempt of court, bringing with it all of the attendant consequences. In this way I believe the enforcement process would work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Property settlement must be a relevant matter in any maintenance proceedings. At the moment it is irrelevant in the child support system. The parent without a home is never able to get one while crushed by child support payments while the other parent has a home already paid off. I have read a determination by a review officer where she said that the non-custodial parent should have budgeted for his child support better and the fact that he <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> might lose his house because of the assessment was irrelevant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The child support system is not working. The cost of administration is horrendous and its outcomes negligible in the hard cases. That cost could more than assist persons seeking redress in the courts and would effect a less destructive impact on decent Australians already in crisis. My constituents are hurting and I will endeavour to do everything in my power to change this facinorous system.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Companies through their directors are charged with certain formal responsibilities. They are required to submit business returns, to pay their taxes and to conduct themselves in an honest manner. In the vast majority of cases, company directors comply with these requirements and discharge their responsibilities honourably. Sadly, however, some Australian company directors do not behave honourably. For them, company laws are made to be broken; for them, taxes exist to be evaded; and, for them, workers are simply a means to an end&mdash;that end being their own short-term enrichment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Australia today, the dishonourable director is increasingly to be found behind those companies which experience sudden collapse&mdash;the company which one day is performing successfully and the next day has the sign saying `closed' hanging on the front gate. These companies are of all shapes and sizes. While they are frequently small and medium firms, they occasionally include much bigger undertakings. Only a few weeks ago the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) related to the House the collapse of one of Australia's largest telecommunications firms, Exicom, and the difficulties this has created for hundreds of workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most significant impact of these insolvencies is on the employees. With no notice, they find their livelihoods destroyed. They are typically owed for wages and associated entitlements, such as recreation leave, long service leave and superannuation. In too many cases these entitlements are never recovered. In recent months, attention has focused on the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3734"> worst of these insolvencies where rogue directors not only wind up to avoid debtors, including workers, but then set up a supposedly new enterprise the next day&mdash;referred to as a typical phoenix company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Securities Commission conducted a survey in May this year into phoenix companies. It found that they are a $1.3 billion drain on the national economy each year and that they now rate as the biggest problem for small and medium businesses&mdash;not, let it be said, unfair dismissals. The study found that at least 9,000 businesses are affected by phoenix company activities each year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Phoenix companies are particularly common in the clothing trade, which has been a large employer in my electorate. Let me state clearly that the vast majority of clothing manufacturers in the Wills electorate and neighbouring areas are reputable and operate with considerable integrity. But there are also some sharks&mdash;people who, I believe, by their actions, forfeit their right to ever have control of a company again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The case of Mr John and Mrs Joanna Karastamatis demonstrates this point. They were, until the end of July, the husband and wife directors of Danapparrel, a men's shirt manufacturer in Collingwood. This company has just gone into liquidation, with $600,000 in debts owed to employees in the form of wages, long service, annual leave and severance entitlements. This is surprising for a company whose balance sheet last October showed assets exceeding $700,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Karastamatis ruthlessly exploited his employees by stringing them along with talk about how tough the economy was and about how things would be better next month. A large proportion of the company's debts were incurred by workers who even then were accepting lesser pay, with the promise that it would be made up to them later. These workers, unlike the directors of Danapparrel, acted in good faith.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 20 August employees were told not to attend work the next day. When workers returned to their workplace the day after, they found the factory deserted. Since then some workers have not even been able to recover <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> personal belongings that they had left in the factory on 20 August. What makes the directors' actions all the more reprehensible is the notification they received at the end of July, several weeks before this asset stripping stunt, disqualifying them from operating as directors in this company. Despite the ASC order, they carried on their business, continuing to deceive those employees who stayed on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What makes their actions quite unforgivable is that this is not the first time John Karastamatis has been involved in a phoenix company scam. It is the fourth time he has been associated with a company that has ended up in the hands of a liquidator. Prior to Danapparrel, the companies Danleroy, JJ Fashions and Crete Fashions, along with their unfortunate employees, had all fallen victim to the same scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no conclusion one can draw from this particular example other than that John and Joanna Karastamatis are crooks. They use the facade of business to camouflage systematic exploitation of workers and, no doubt, other businesses. They should never again be able to direct a company and they deserve to be condemned in the strongest possible terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously, if the law has not to this point in time discouraged people like this from conducting themselves in such a disgraceful manner, it is time the law was changed. Honourable members may be aware that the former Labor government announced its intention in October last year to introduce stage 3 of the Corporations Law simplification program. This package of reforms included a doubling of the maximum disqualification of directors from five to 10 years, and the lowering of the two strikes cut off. A director could be issued with a show cause notice if he or she is involved in just one failed company, if the company was mismanaged and their conduct justifies disqualification.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3735"> These reforms are very necessary, although I believe they may be inadequate. I believe we need to look at life suspension of people convicted of certain corporate offences&mdash;not five or 10 years, but life. The community should, under certain circumstances, have the right to prohibit rogue directors who deliber ately rip off workers and other creditors from ever controlling companies again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently the stage 3 proposals are being examined by a task force under the control of the Attorney-General (Mr Williams). I understand it will be some months before the task force produces a discussion paper, after which there will be a three&hyphen;month wait before any legislation comes before the House, and that this is not likely for at least a year. At the same time, the government has reduced funding for companies and securities regulation in the forward estimates from $111 million this financial year to $93 million by the year 2000. So the government knows that phoenix companies are the biggest problem for small and medium sized companies in Australia today&mdash;not the unfair dismissal act, as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) would have us believe&mdash;yet it is prepared to reduce funding to the only authority that can effectively tackle the problems. What message is the government sending small and medium businesses? What message is the government sending workers who are ripped off by these rogue directors?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I began this afternoon by referring to the workers who all too often are the victims of insolvencies. They currently lack adequate protection under bankruptcy and insolvency law. I believe this deficiency must be addressed. The key problem lies in ensuring that benefits legitimately owed to workers are preserved in a way which ensures they can survive any insolvency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The federal government should address this problem by considering a new approach, one in which a proportion of company taxation is set aside in a guarantee fund, so that even when companies close up overnight, workers will be assured of their entitlements being honoured by virtue of a special fund created for just that purpose. Given that we already have in this country a sophisticated infrastructure for the collection of company taxation, the establishment of a means of diverting a minute stream of that revenue for the protection of workers would not be a difficult task. In 1994-95 company taxation raised $15.3 billion. The protection of workers who lose their entitlements as a result of insolvencies <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> would amount to a minute fraction of this revenue, probably in the vicinity of one&hyphen;quarter of one per cent&mdash;around $38 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Liberal and National parties came to office promising to look after the battlers and promising to do the right thing by business. On the issue of phoenix companies, which impact significantly on both workers and business, the Liberal Party has done nothing so far to back up its rhetoric. We need action now. I call on the Attorney-General and the Prime Minister to give a commitment to tougher corporate laws, and I call on them to introduce a scheme of workers guarantee funds that will put an end to the rip-offs which are an ugly blot on Australia's corporate reputation today.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like all members of this House and all those unsuccessful candidates at the last federal election, I spoke with many hundreds if not thousands of people during the course of the election campaign. They had many issues to raise with us and there were differing points of view. It did not seem to matter where I went, whether it was to a rural or a residential area, what people's political persuasions or socioeconomic situations were, they always brought up one particular issue. That was parliamentary standards&mdash;that is, the standards of the people in this House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seemed that they were sick and tired of seeing on the nightly news abuse being thrown across this chamber in all directions. The charge was often led by the former Prime Minister. He used to throw considerable personal abuse and make personal attacks on the then opposition. I am pleased to report that, under the leadership of the current Prime Minister (Mr Howard), we have seen a great change. We no longer see the personal vilification that we saw in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3736"> At the end of the first sittings of the 38th Parliament a particular issue came to my attention. The issue was raised by the member for Hotham (Mr Crean). On the second last day of the sittings the member for Hotham made a serious accusation about this govern ment. I quote from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 28 June where he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is the most centralised, dictatorial government that this parliament has had in 13 years.</PARA>
<PARA>I wonder what would lead the Manager of Opposition Business in this House to make such an accusation, particularly since this government had been elected for less than six months and his own party had been overwhelming rejected by the people. He went on to say a little later in that speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we have had the guillotine and the gag imposed seven times. Understand what that means. For a parliament that you say has to be supreme and given the opportunity for open debate for consideration for all issues, why move the guillotine and the gag, the very purpose of which is to restrict debate, to limit the time, to close off the opposition in what it can say and move?</PARA>
<PARA>I am very much a believer in freedom of speech not only in this place but also throughout Australia. I felt behoved to make a closer examination of exactly what he was referring to. The member for Hotham mentioned that the gag had been imposed on the opposition seven times in the first six weeks of the sittings of this 38th Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the record and explain to the Australian people what imposing a gag means. I think the first occasion he was referring to was when we were discussing the formation of committees in this place. That is something that occurs at the start of every parliament. On that particular occasion, when the debate was bought to an end there had not been 30 minutes or one hour of debate, there had been four hours and five minutes of debate on an issue of very little consequence&mdash;that is, the formation of committees. It gets better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He then referred to the ATSIC legislation. There were five hours and 24 minutes of debate on that issue. I put it to those opposite that if you cannot develop an argument in five hours and 24 minutes perhaps you are in the wrong game. It gets even better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We then had the Telstra debate. We took the Telstra issue to the Australian population. Everyone outside of this place had their say on it which is what rightly and fairly should happen inside this place. When he claims that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> we gagged the debate it leads me to have a good look at how long we actually spent on the debate. We did not spend five hours or 10 hours on it, we spent 15 hours and 52 minutes on it. Can you imagine turning up to work and listening to nothing but the Telstra debate for two eight&hyphen;hour days only to have someone tell you at the end of it, `You have not given us enough time.' It is time the opposition had a long hard look at itself. It gets even better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we had the debate on the workplace relations bill which involves fundamental changes to the Australian way of life which ensure that we can go into the next millennium a far more competitive nation. How long did we spend on that debate? Some 20 hours and five minutes. The opposition spent eight hours and 50 minutes putting their arguments together. When you review some of the speeches given by those opposite it would appear that the speech was handed from one speaker to the next because there was very little substance, a lot of rhetoric and an awful lot of repetition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue that I would like to emphasise is social security and the bill that was discussed on Wednesday, 29 May. This is a very important bill and the member for Hotham, the Manager of Opposition Business, alluded to that. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have the other example of the gag and the guillotine being moved on the social security bill&mdash;another terribly important piece of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>Let us see what they did on 29 May with this terribly important piece of legislation. As the normal business of the day was drawing to a close it became evident from the speakers list that we were not going to exhaust the list of speakers from the opposition benches. At 7.30 p.m., in accordance with normal practice, the government moved in accordance with standing orders:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the House do now adjourn.</PARA>
<PARA>The idea was that we would oppose this measure and facilitate extra time for the opposition to enunciate its views on the social security legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3737"> How did they vote? Surprise, surprise! They voted to close the place down. They did not want to talk about the social security legislation. They effectively moved a gag on them selves. It flies in the face of this rubbish that has been put forward by the member for the Hotham in claiming it was a gag. They were allowed to continue debate on the social security bill. It only lasted 50 minutes before the chief opposition whip moved that the debate be adjourned, effectively moving once again that his own speakers not be heard. This was lost on party lines. The government continued with the debate ensuring that this bill was out of the way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We only went for another 33 minutes when the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) put the motion&mdash;and you can guess what it was:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the debate be now adjourned.</PARA>
<PARA>She no longer wanted to hear what her party had to say about social security. She went one step further and did something which is almost without precedent in this place and spoke next on this subject.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the member for Prospect moved a motion that the place adjourn and that she no longer be heard, effectively placing a gag upon themselves, the third gag in less than two hours. It really does raise the question of who was moving the gag on whom. At 9.34 p.m., the chief opposition whip obviously was tiring of hearing his own people speak and moved once again:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the debate be now adjourned.</PARA>
<PARA>Once again, the motion was lost. Finally, the member for Banks (Mr Melham) at 10.01 p.m. moved yet again:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the debate be now adjourned.</PARA>
<PARA>In the space of just over 2&half; hours we saw the opposition effectively bring their own debate to a close. They did not want to speak about social security or have their arguments heard. It makes one wonder: did they really have anything of substance to add or were they simply wanting to say very little about a very important subject? At 10.14 p.m. the chief government whip moved that the honourable member be not heard any further&mdash;and that was the end of the issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This really does fly in the face of the comments made by the manager of opposition business, the honourable member for Hotham, on 28 June when he said that this government has used the guillotine and gag seven times. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> In one evening, this Labor opposition effectively moved five times to have themselves not heard. How serious are they about having their views enunciated in this place or, more importantly, are they about filibustering, time delays and wasting taxpayers' time and money in a procedure which has no place in an Australia which must go further ahead?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The challenge as we move into this next session of parliament is for all of us in this place&mdash;on both sides of the chamber&mdash;to have respect for this place and not to waste time, filibuster or be obstructionist. No&hyphen;one is removing the opportunity of the opposition to look closely at the material placed before them. No&hyphen;one is asking them not to be critical of the material and bills put before this House. But the challenge for this Labor opposition is to take a responsible attitude towards the budget debate and not filibuster, time waste or delay and not be obstructionist in ensuring that the budget process comes to its conclusion.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tempted as I am to enter into a discussion about parliamentary standards on the basis of the contribution by the honourable member for Longman (Mr Brough), I will reply to just one part of the discussion he had of the way in which the place was run in the earlier session this year. What he did not tell the House in the grievance debate today is that on the Wednesday in May that he mentioned, when there were a number of motions moved by the opposition to adjourn the debate&mdash;which is a distinct difference from gagging the debate or guillotining it; all it means is we were wishing to adjourn the debate and come back the next day&mdash;the point we were trying to make was that at very short notice on that Wednesday the opposition were informed that we were going to go beyond the 8 o'clock adjournment, as put down in the standing orders.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What it was about was the conditions under which this place is run. It goes not only to the efficiencies of us as members but the efficiencies of the many people who support us and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3738"> work within the House. This was not the first Wednesday that we had been asked to sit beyond the agreed 8 o'clock adjournment. So when the honourable member for Longman wants to enter into debate about standards he might be best served, if he wishes to have this debate, in sponsoring a debate at private members' time on Monday about standards because there are a lot of things that we could discuss about the behaviour over time of oppositions in the past. We could also discuss what attempts have been made by the Labor Party when in government and, indeed, the consideration and cooperation in some aspects by members of the coalition in trying to improve the way this place works. In fairness, he should rely on a proper discussion of parliamentary standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today what I wish to talk about, and sincerely grieve about, is the state of local government in Victoria. There are a number of aspects which one could talk about concerning the state of local government in Victoria but I especially want to talk about the concept of compulsory competitive tendering. The compulsory competitive tendering that has been entered into in the Victorian situation is a phenomenon that is legislated for. An artificial target has been set by the Kennett government, which at the moment stands at 50 per cent. So 50 per cent of the activities of local government must be put out to tendering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have found is that from time to time some of the municipalities, when they have started out on trying to achieve this target, have been very  close to it because what is included is outside capital works. So, for instance, the City of Whittlesea was having a major entertainment and function centre built under a private contract. Because that capital works contract was put into its original percentage it looked all right. But now it has to proceed at a greater rate of knots to try to achieve this artificial target.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is this artificial target about? It is about an ideology, a form of right&hyphen;wing ideology that from time to time masquerades as economic rationalism, that in some way the free market can achieve great things in all matters. But it must be remembered when we <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> talk about compulsory competitive tendering&mdash;the so&hyphen;called CCT process&mdash;that we are not just talking about private companies deciding to outsource some of their operations to subcontractors; what we are talking about is a sphere of responsible government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whether that sphere of responsible government is, in the main, in the hands of unelected commissioners or not, it is a sphere of government and CCT is supposed to achieve greater efficiencies by ensuring that the services and functions are market tested, as the jargon would have it. The purpose of the market testing is to see at what cost the market will perform the same service. Expenditure over the lowest bid supposedly indicates a surplus that indicates inefficiency, according to the theory. But I would contend that many of the functions of local government which are in the public or community interest should not be considered in these strictly up and down commercial terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The result of the CCT process is that large portions of local government bureaucracy are disappearing and the private sector is performing those functions. In the past, local governments were the decision makers, the collectors of the funds, and the people who allocated the funds for and delivered services. Under CCT, and in accordance with the current right&hyphen;wing philosophy, those three functions are separated. In the purest form of this separation there are only two entities&mdash;a purchaser and a provider.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The local government model of CCT in Victoria leaves much to be desired. Far from delivering great efficiencies, the whole process has been costly to local government, has destroyed the jobs of former employees, and in many cases has resulted in severe reductions in the quality of services provided by local government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The costs begin with the writing of specifications for the tenders. Who have to write up those tenders? The council staff in the areas that are being opened up to competitive tendering&mdash;because they are the ones who know.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In one recent example, staff were required to provide no fewer than four different sets of specifications so that a decision could be <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3739"> made about which set would be put to tender. Imagine the amount of time put into writing those specifications. When it has to be done four times over, is that efficiency? I think not. We must also question the morality of asking workers in local government to put in place something that jeopardises their own employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the Victorian model of CCT, in&hyphen;house bids are permitted. In putting together in&hyphen;house bids, council workers are offered assistance by way of additional resources. The experience has been that, in the end, the overwhelming majority of tenders have gone to local in&hyphen;house bids. But already we have lost an efficiency because of the additional cost of putting together the internal bids&mdash;a cost over and above the setting of the specifications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a recent example in the City of Whittlesea, an in&hyphen;house team made the only bid for a tender. I put it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the rules of the marketplace suggest that if that tender were in order that team should have got it because nobody else offered to do it at any cost. But the in&hyphen;house bid was rejected because the goalposts were shifted; they were told that there was an upper limit on the tender. There was no discussion in the specifications about that before the event, only a line item somewhere in the council's budget papers. So where is the advantage to the community and those who need the services provided?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The board of the local regional library service has decided to consider among the proposals for the tendering of the library one that separates the service into three components. That is despite the fact that no other library board has separated functions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The library staff recommended to the board that the library be tendered as a whole service. That recommendation was ignored. We now will have a tendering process where offers are made for the whole service and offers are made for three components of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, an independent study undertaken by KPMG for the British Department of Natural Heritage found that CCT for public libraries was `inappropriate' because the prospect of significant cost reduction was <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> limited. It found that there was no natural market for the delivery of public library services because the skills required were so specialised and `not readily found'. It found that the cost of implementing the whole process was substantial and that the overwhelming weight of evidence suggested that the library service `is and should continue to be a "core" public sector activity'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The CCT process is a farrago of contradictions. It is a poor ideological experiment and bad social policy. CCT has been applied arbitrarily to fixed percentages of local government services on the assumption that the private sector will always do it better. That assumption is palpably false.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">CCT has been applied without any thought as to the appropriate services to subject to competition. It has been suggested that a large number of in&hyphen;house bids are successful. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, last year marked two decades of the operation of Australia's Family Law Act. The introduction of the act in 1975 reflected changes in matrimonial laws throughout much of the Western world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to 1959, divorce law in Australia remained under the jurisdiction of seven states. In that year, the government, pursuant to section 51 of the Australian constitution, introduced its own legislation in the form of the Matrimonial Causes Act. The effect of the bill was to consolidate the laws of the states into a code of general application throughout Australia. That act provided 14 grounds for divorce.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth parliament subsequently dealt with the formalities for the creation of marriage in the Marriage Act 1961. Fundamental changes to the existing law were proposed when former Senator Lionel Murphy, then Commonwealth Attorney&hyphen;General, introduced a series of bills into this parliament in 1973 and 1974, culminating in the Family Law Act of 1975.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a series of debates prior to the enactment of the Family Law Act, reference was made to United Nations documents, in particular the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3740"> Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Lionel Murphy referred to it in his second reading speech. That covenant recognises the centrality of the family in society when it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and State.</PARA>
<PARA>The covenant also provides:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">States parties to the present Covenant shall take appropriate steps to ensure equality of rights and responsibilities of spouses as to marriage, during marriage and at its dissolution. In the case of dissolution, provision shall be made for the necessary protection of any children.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>Hence, the Family Law Act, which has existed for just over two decades, was constructed on two pillars: firstly, responsibilities and, secondly, rights. Hence, the bill introduced in 1973 and upon which subsequent bills were drafted was based on a series of stated principles, the first of which was that `a good family law should buttress, rather than undermine, the stability of marriage'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The central importance of family was explicitly recognised in section 43 of the Family Law Act. This section provides that, in making any adjudication, the court must have regard to the following factors: the need to preserve and protect the institution of marriage as a union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others voluntarily entered into for life; the need to give the widest possible protection and assistance to the family as the natural and fundamental group unit of society, particularly while it is responsible for the care and education of dependent children; the need to protect the rights of children and promote their welfare; and the means available for assisting parties to a marriage to consider reconciliation or the improvement of their relationship to each other and to the children of the marriage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other pillar of the Family Law Act, namely, that of rights, is reflected in replacement of the grounds of divorce based on matrimonial fault with a single ground&mdash;breakdown of marriage, evidenced by 12 months separation of the parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the past 20 years there has been a considerable change so far as marriage and divorce is concerned. Whilst it is true that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> each year approximately 115,000 marriages are celebrated in Australia, we have seen in the last 20 years an increase in the rate of divorce. It is often said that over a lifetime something like one-third of all marriages in Australia will end in separation and divorce. Taking just the statistics which relate to the number of divorced women per thousand married women, there has been a threefold increase over 20 years. Hence, a considerable number of divorces occur and a considerable number of children are subject to the process of separation and divorce and their lives are interrupted in some ways as a consequence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite that, marriage and family life remains the overwhelming choice of Australians. This may be because, as the Council on Families in America pointed out, marriage has evolved in societies in the Western world as a complex institution containing at least five dimensions to which people feel attraction: a natural dimension, a religious dimension, an economic aspect, a social dimension and a legal dimension. However, the large number of divorces that occur each year cause trauma for many people in Australian society and have an enormous economic cost&mdash;in the order of at least $3 billion a year but, more realistically, probably $4 billion a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, the changes which have occurred over the last decade or more have had a considerable impact on young couples entering marriage. Last year social researcher Jeanne Strachan, in a presentation entitled `What young couples want in the nineties', said that there were three things that people want above anything else: a caring and compatible life partner, children, and the best for their children. She said that it was always and probably will be always thus. However, there are a number of problems, partly economic and partly social, that are facing many young couples entering relationships these days. Strachan says, for example:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Young couples today are the first generation since the war to face the reality that they often can't obtain, even with two full-time workers in the house, what their own parents saw as a fair and reasonable reward for their hard work.</PARA>
<PARA>This of course raises a fundamental dilemma for many people today: in our modern society, in which global competition is something <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3741"> which is being pursued in order to remain competitive as a nation within a community of nations, there is increasing pressure on people to work, to work harder, to work longer and to have both spouses in the work force. That, in turn, has an impact on families in that less time is available than would have been in the past. So people today are facing discontinuities in their lives. Changes in the marketplace have caused work insecurity, and reliance upon social welfare and social security, which has been targeted by a number of governments on both sides of this chamber, has also led to a degree of insecurity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mention these things by way of background because over the past two decades in which the Family Law Act has been in operation in Australia a series of inquiries have looked at different aspects of the operation of the act. In 1980 a joint committee of this place and the other place held an inquiry. In the last two parliaments, the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues looked into a variety of things, including the operation of the Family Law Act, custody, maintenance, parenting plans, parenting orders, and the funding and administration of the court and the Child Support Agency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what has not been looked at over the past 20 years is what might be regarded as another aspect of family law, namely, marriage. Questions are often asked in society about whether or not it is too easy to get a divorce. People look at the statistics and say that we ought to make getting a divorce a bit tougher for people. We do not seem to be asking about the events surrounding people getting married in the first place or whether we are doing enough for them and providing enough by way of education and preparation so that when people come to make a lifetime decision they are more aware of their expectations of each other and more aware of the relationship they are about to enter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was therefore heartening for me to note that in the budget this government has committed an extra $6.1 million over three years to marriage and relationship education. It is also equally heartening that the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) has given a reference to the House of Representatives Standing <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which I chair, to consider and report on a number of relevant matters, namely, the range of community views on the factors contributing to marriage and relationship breakdown; the categories of individuals most likely to benefit from programs aimed at preventing marriage and relationship breakdown; the most effective strategies to address the needs of identified target groups; and the role of governments in the provision of these services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that members of the Australian public who have an interest in this matter and in relationships in the Australian community and who have a contribution to make will make their contribution to the committee by writing a letter to the secretary of the committee, care of the House of Representatives. As I said, family life and marriage is still overwhelmingly supported in Australia. It is something that people will want to see continued. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Initial job preparation occurs in the years of post-compulsory education with training in senior high school, TAFE, colleges and universities and in the apprenticeship and traineeship systems. There has been a massive change in the pattern of education participation by young Australians in the past 10 to 15 years. This change has seen school retention rates for year 12 rise from 34.5 per cent in 1980 to 72.2 per cent in 1995. However, there was a peak of 77.1 per cent in 1992, which would indicate that school retention rates also relate to the availability of employment. There <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3742"> has been a corresponding increase in the number of school leavers entering our universities, at least up until this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we go back to the 1950s or 1960s, we see that young people left school either with an intermediate certificate or with a leaving certificate at 15 or 16 years of age and then in most cases went into an employment and training mode for the next 10 years. I am not a particularly strong supporter of high school retention rates as a test of the effectiveness of our education system. I believe high retention rates are in part caused by the tight labour market and, coupled with the move for early retirement of working people, say, from 55 years of age and up, that means that Australia is losing out on considerable productivity capacity by shortening the working life of our skilled workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, back to the point: this surge in participation rates has raised important issues about what should be the proper form of education and training for young people after they complete their compulsory education. It is extremely important that young people focus on a career path in the final two years of their schooling. For students intending to enter the work force through a traineeship or apprenticeship, I believe it is important for them to be exposed to the work environment during the final two years of school through work experience programs, TAFE courses or industry related subjects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, in a high school with years 7 to 12, I believe it is difficult to spread resources and teaching skills to enable maximum focus on years 11 and 12. These two years require a different culture than applied in the earlier school years. In years 11 and 12 it is necessary to move from the relatively unstructured subject choice that applied in earlier years to structured student training and pathways. Schools then have the opportunity to develop structural programs that are linked to particular industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The pathway concept applies to both academic and vocational curriculum and should be strongly allied with employment related key competencies. A pathway defined by a structured program of studies is taken for granted in TAFE and universities; but in years <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 11 and 12 such program concepts go against the tradition of unstructured subject courses which apply in years 7 to 10.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thought generally that the stand-alone senior high school, such as we have locally at John Paul II at Marayong, in my electorate, was the ideal circuit&hyphen;breaker between school and work and allowed total focus to be on the future careers of students. Could I also mention, seeing that a number of references has been made today relating to the football activities, that John Paul II Senior High School is an excellent college as far as rugby league is concerned and that it is playing in the grand final of the Commonwealth Bank Cup competition this Saturday. I take this opportunity to publicly wish them well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Coming back to the point: likewise, the Nirimba campus at the University of Western Sydney, in my electorate, will have both state and private senior high schools&mdash;years 11 and 12&mdash;which will enable students and staff to develop an appropriate education attitude to careers in industry and commerce. One of the positive achievements of the Labor period in office from 1983 to 1996 was to obtain a genuine national approach to training. The then Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Dawkins, in opening the Towards a Skilled Australia Conference at the Sydney Convention and Exhibition Centre at Darling Harbour in March 1991, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would emphasise that training and the development of a training culture is the key to Australia's international competitiveness.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have to develop and utilise a comprehensive system of skilling, re&hyphen;skilling, re-education and continuing education to take account of new demands and greater competition.</PARA>
<PARA>As our traditional employment growth industries in manufacturing now require a smaller but more highly skilled and versatile work force, and with small business, tourism and information technology offering more opportunities of employment growth, we need to ensure that our training programs are flexible enough to meet the demands of these industries as well as give young people the proper accreditation to enable them to continue to upgrade their skills. To meet this requirement much of the practical training will take place in the business or on the shop floor. Both on- <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3743">the-job training and off-the-job training will therefore need to be recognised and given appropriate accreditation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the Labor government's initiatives was that training through labour market programs and private providers now attracts formal recognition and articulation into mainstream vocational training. Many of these programs are targeted at the most at&hyphen;risk group in our society: the people who may have lost confidence in training. I refer in particular to the long-term unemployed; to the working mother who is seeking to re&hyphen;enter the work force after a period of time raising her family; and people who have been retrenched, probably for the first time in their working life, and who may need to upgrade or learn new skills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is important for the community and for local businesses that the people most at risk have the opportunity of reaching their full potential in relation to education, skills and employment opportunities. These people are the customers and possible employees of the future, so they should not be neglected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most successful labour market programs for getting people most at risk back into the work force was skillshare. Skillshare programs are very cost effective. For an outlay of approximately $1,000, and provided jobs are available, you can turn an unemployed person from being a social security recipient into a local tax paying consumer of goods and services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Skillshare projects are estimated to have assisted, since their inception in 1989, over 880,000 unemployed Australians. Over the year to November 1995, DEETYA monitoring indicated that 47 per cent of skillshare assisted people were in jobs three months after leaving the program and a further 16 per cent were in other forms of activity which kept them off benefits. A report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> journal in the UK found that training programs which produced successful outcomes were those that operated on a small scale, had strong links to employers, helped people search for work and helped them acquire basic skills&mdash;meaning literacy, numeracy and personal skills; skills more elementary than <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> those taught in training schemes. Skillshare has all these characteristics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe we may have to drastically alter our training program even further due to the predominance of the economic rationalist theories that today dominate the thinking of our governments. The downsizing and privatisation of government enterprises and the total focus on the bottom line mean that education and training will be seen more and more as a cost and not as an investment. With some notable exceptions, industry has failed to produce a sufficient number and variety of skilled workers to meet demand. The federal government's recent decision to increase our intake of skilled migrants supports this statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where previously this gap in availability of skilled labour was to some extent filled by training carried out by government enterprises such as State Rail and Qantas, this does not now apply. One advantage of on-the-job training is that the worker is in paid employment, which means that he or she has a feeling of job satisfaction, an interest in the industry where they are working, and, therefore, a greater initiative to improve their skills. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Speaker, as you and other members of this House would be aware, one of the main causes of suffering and death in Australia and elsewhere in the world is cancer. Most people have had a friend or relative suffer with some form of cancer and, for many we have known, unfortunately the disease has been terminal. My own sister Marie sadly died a few years ago from cancer of the throat. Many people even dread the name of the disease and many of us, whenever we have to undergo tests for an illness, have the question in the back of our minds: is this `the big C'?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some interesting statistics on cancer reveal that in Australia, for males, the rates of cancer increased to a peak in 1984 and have decreased steadily since then. Lung cancer in females continues to rise&mdash;the rate in 1993 being more than double that for 1973. It is sad to report that at a function I was at the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3744"> other night, out of the 18 people in attendance 15 young people were smoking. Unfortunately, most of those smoking were young women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For melanoma of the skin, notification was incomplete prior to 1975 and between 1977 and 1982. However, a peak occurred in the late 1980s, possibly associated with increased community awareness. Otherwise, rates have risen steadily: 91 per cent higher in 1993 than in 1976 for males and 17 per cent higher for females. There are many other statistics I could cite. They are all sad, but, I might add, they are not without hope.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of research which is carried out throughout the world to find a cure for this insidious disease that comes in so many forms, treatment is improving, but not as fast as we would hope. Even when treatment is available, it is not always easily accessible to those who have need to use it, especially those living in rural areas. This is why I, as the federal member representing the Riverina, am raising the matter in grievances in the House today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For some years, the St Vincent's oncology unit has been providing an outreach program for cancer sufferers in rural New South Wales&mdash;and this includes the Riverina area&mdash;with a weekly service to Wagga Wagga and a bi-weekly service to Griffith. This would indicate, as though any indication is needed, that cancer knows no bounds and attacks rural dwellers as it does those in major urban centres. One of the differences is the access these different groups have to radiotherapy treatment&mdash;with very few facilities existing in the area that I represent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently, the oncology department of St Vincent's  Hospital put forward a proposal to the New South Wales department of health that a radiotherapy unit be established in Wagga Wagga and one in Albury. Both of those cities are located in the recently announced Greater Murray Area Health Service region. St Vincent's are prepared to fund the units and also provide specialist services, and it is envisaged that there would be resource sharing between the two units.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Because most cancer sufferers in those areas surrounding Wagga Wagga and Albury requir ing radiotherapy now travel to either Sydney, Melbourne or Canberra for treatment, the proposal from St Vincent's was seen as a wonderful breakthrough. Not only would it save time and money and the discomfort of long travel for a person who is unwell; it would also allow them to remain close to their families. The suggestion from the oncology department from St Vincent's was that one radiotherapy unit should be established in Wagga Wagga with Calvary Hospital providing funds for the cost of housing the unit. The second unit will be established at the Albury-Wodonga private hospital, which would also provide funds for establishment costs. The private hospitals were suggested as sites for the units because of the difficulty public hospitals would have in funding the cost of constructing new facilities to house the units.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since that suggestion was put forward to the New South Wales state government, other organisations have forwarded proposals to provide radiotherapy units to the Greater Murray health area. Unfortunately, as I understand it, all of those submissions have suggested that both units be located in Albury. There are various reasons as to why this proposal for two units in Albury is being put forward&mdash;firstly, it would assist the New South Wales state government to overcome a difficult situation in Albury with the transfer of a service from one particular hospital service provider and, secondly, the provision of the radiotherapy unit as a replacement service to that provider could assist in achieving the future viability of that unit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said earlier, most people now travel to Sydney, Melbourne or Canberra for treatment. Certainly, a unit in Albury would draw cancer sufferers from northern Victoria and perhaps people living midway between Albury and Wagga Wagga. Similarly, those people living to the south, to the north and to the west of Wagga Wagga would access a radiotherapy facility located in Wagga Wagga. However, if both units are established in Albury, I cannot see those people from the Riverina patient catchment area, which extends hundreds of kilometres to the north, west and east of Wagga Wagga, deciding to access treatment in Albury. They would continue their contact with Sydney or Canberra.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3745">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I am aware the decision as to the location of these units rests with the New South Wales state government, because of Medicare funding the locations must be approved by the federal government. Mr Acting Speaker, I believe that a submission will be in the office of the Federal Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) today from the New South Wales government. I am asking the minister, if this submission does not provide for a radiotherapy unit in both Wagga Wagga and Albury, that it be rejected on the grounds of: firstly, commonsense; secondly, economic rationality; and, thirdly, equity and simply on humanitarian grounds, keeping in mind those people who must travel to access treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is estimated that, due to the cost and inconvenience of receiving day treatment at distant hospitals, only 15 per cent of diagnosed cancer victims proceed to therapy and those that do travel often have difficulties. I have had a number of phone calls from doctors in my electorate and also from people who suffer from cancer who have to travel to other areas. I will take the opportunity of reading one of many letters that appeared in the Wagga <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Advertiser</EMPHASIS> on 28 August 1996. It is from Mr Allan Turner who says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sir,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">After having the experience of caring for and losing a loved one with breast cancer, I can only feel for those people who are now fighting the disease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The enormous pressure and stress that is placed upon a family when long and arduous trips to Sydney or Melbourne are required for the cancer patient to receive radiotherapy treatment, eventually take their toll.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need for a radiotherapy unit in Wagga is long overdue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Family, friends and familiar surroundings are certainly more conducive to the healing process than waiting in long queues of patients, unfamiliar and overworked hospital staff, being shuttled back and forth to hospital like cattle and then, as if that was not enough, staying at accommodation and nursing centres such as Jean Colvin Hospital, where you are always reminded of the disease. Not to mention only having contact with other friends and family via the humble telephone. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Please don't get me wrong, Jean Colvin Hospital and centres alike do a fantastic job. However, as the saying goes `There is no place like home'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Cancer patients are very special people. They show great courage, determination and understanding. They deserve the best possible chance of recovery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is about time our politicians acknowledge this need, and implement its approval of the radiotherapy unit in Wagga.</PARA>
<PARA>I certainly have no hang&hyphen;up in relation to Albury, and I am sure the Albury community agree with me that, in the interests of equity, if two radiotherapy units are to be provided in the Greater Murray Area Health Service region one should be in Albury and the other in Wagga Wagga.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure we all wish for a more efficient service for cancer sufferers wherever they may live. Improved accessibility to treatment is one way of providing this. In this situation let governments provide this by approving one radiotherapy unit for Albury and one for Wagga Wagga and not settle on a less than adequate service for the sake of political expediency.</PARA>

It is a budget that delivers for all Australia. It is a long overdue budget which will set the nation's economy back on course because it provides the base for sustainable economic growth. It is a budget that will ensure that the Common <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3747"> wealth government's call on the nation's savings is at long last brought under control.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who can forget the 20&hyphen;plus per cent interest rates from Labor's economic management in the late eighties, early nineties? How many businesses, both large and small, home owners, farmers and miners were sacrificed in that period? How many farmers, miners, foresters, fishermen and tourist operators were hammered by the high exchange rates from that period? When prices were down for so many of our export industries, we were keeping the exchange rates artificially high in effect. We are not going to let that happen again. If we had continued down the Labor path, it would have happened again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last five years of our so&hyphen;called official recovery, Commonwealth government borrowings increased from some $30 billion to $100 billion. To be more exact, as pointed out by the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) today, in 1990 we had $17 billion worth of borrowings and today we have $96 billion worth of borrowings. This is an extra debt for every Australian man, woman and child of some $4,000 in those final five years of Labor government. It is a legacy that we now have to work through and that future generations will have to work through. The interest cost of this debt is now up to some $10 billion per year. In the budget this year the payment of interest on all government borrowings is $10 billion. It is, as such, a major distortion in adding to the difficulty of casting a proper and responsible budget that we have been left this legacy by Labor. It had to be addressed. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the government have addressed it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we were to raise taxes just to pay the interest on this debt, it would mean an extra 16 cents in every dollar that Australians pay by way of income tax. If you went another way, it would mean a doubling of fuel taxes simply to make up that interest rate payment. Neither option would be countenanced by this government, but it shows the magnitude of the debt legacy left by Labor. Getting control of the debt is essential in ensuring lower real interest rates and a lower exchange rate. This will provide real benefits to the bottom lines of all those businesses in rural and regional <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australia that have to compete on world markets or depend upon the industries that have to be internationally competitive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Provincial Australia is more dependent upon maintaining international competitiveness. Our great industries&mdash;be they mining, forestry, fishing, tourism, value adding, ETMs, a raft of diversity which constitutes provincial Australia today&mdash;need to be internationally competitive if they are to boost the export effort. This budget delivers for all our international trading industries and all of those who work in them or service them. Not only have we got the overall budget context right to improve prosperity overall, we have also implemented a series of measures which will help take them further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The diesel fuel rebate scheme for the mining, agriculture, fishing and forestry sectors has been retained. This scheme is not a subsidy but the non-application of a penalty tax to off&hyphen;road use by our export industries. It is the correct decision by the coalition government, and one which I and my colleagues strongly welcome. There will be a redirection of $150 million in capital gains tax to small business rolling over into new businesses or for retirement. This will boost the engine of job creation in the Australian economy for the small business sector. If you go to a Page or a Richmond where small business suffered so much under federal Labor, this is the sort of incentive which you hear small businessmen speaking of in Grafton, Lismore and Murwillumbah and, as such, is one which has been pushed by those two members and one which has now been delivered as part of the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also helped by reducing the provisional tax uplift factor for this year from eight to six per cent, another $180 million significant boost for small business. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) will shortly announce further steps with regard to the supermarket to Asia strategy, which is about getting on the front foot and pushing more of our fresh fruit and vegetables and a wide raft of products into Asia. It was an absolute delight to see fresh milk flowing into the Hong Kong supermarkets just a few days <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3748"> ago&mdash;and to help boost that particular project; and fresh citrus from Sunraysia to Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also removing the $20 billion FBT penalty on remote area housing for the primary industry sector. That is an important breakthrough and something Labor never got around to doing. In my own portfolio, budget initiatives have been deliberately focused towards small and medium business, with a particular emphasis on potential and new exporters in regional Australia. Budget initiatives have been deliberately focused in a way which will help new exporters crack into export.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are maintaining Austrade as a $100&hyphen;plus million organisation, with its overseas network especially finetuned for helping new exporters. But we are also refocusing the export market development grants scheme which stays but in a way which will be capped to provide, for the first time ever, for the tourism industry at a full rate under the EMDG scheme&mdash;something Labor have always opposed but something which we are implementing. In addition, we are lowering the threshold level from $30,000 to $20,000, reducing the categories of rebate from 11 to six to provide simplification but also to reduce the opportunity to have the scheme rorted to the very small extent that it is rorted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might add that the capping mechanism is very tilted towards small and medium business and encourages them to break through into exports. In that respect, I appreciate the contribution of consultants associated with this scheme in helping with its reconstruction, revamping and refocusing and the role that they generally play, including that of Mr J. Loughnan, the current President of the Australian Institute of Export.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget is not just about bringing prosperity back to small and medium business across Australia; we are also delivering an improved infrastructure and social environment. As a sparsely populated continent and nation Australia is highly dependent upon efficient road transport, so the black spots roads program is coming back and we are delivering on the Pacific Highway commitment which was well launched on a very hot day during the election campaign&mdash;in a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> nondescript place, dare I say, but one where the Prime Minister elect, then Leader of the Opposition, gave an absolute commitment with regard to the Pacific Highway. That commitment is delivered in this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also moving to boost the circumstances of families across Australia. It is a delight that the family tax initiative will be a billion dollar one, commencing on 1 January next. Families have been neglected by Labor for too long. Many people retire from the metropolitan areas to provincial Australia, and this is another example of where specific action has been taken. You might well ask why Labor hates retirees, why Labor allowed an anomaly to ripple on for all these years and not address it. The steps we have taken in two stages to remove the anomaly which has been impacting upon retirees will be a great boost to the wellbeing of those retirees who were subject to a taxation circumstance that was long overdue for removal. We have maintained the age and service pension requirements and the indexation of those pensions, representing a great step forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the areas of health and education, the budget has taken a range of steps to help bridge a gap which has emerged during the recession, especially during the drought, with so many country towns losing their doctors&mdash;never to be replaced&mdash;and so many postings in general practice across regional Australia. To address that in a very direct way, the budget provides for a boost for the infrastructure of rural health, including the introduction of the John Flynn scholarship as well as the establishment of six university departments of rural health.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also bringing in initiatives to support rural town services for general practitioners and specialists and a package of $20 million per year for rural areas and hospitals to support research and development, rural infrastructure, training for rural doctors and career employment of non&hyphen;specialised hospital doctors. The long neglect of rural health issues is at long last being addressed by a government that cares for residents of Australia who happen not to live in a major city.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think both sides of the House would concede that the difficult issue of youth <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3749"> suicide has been out there for too long. I do not dwell on the subject greatly because I think it is an area that has to be worked through with a great deal of care and commitment, but I am delighted that there is a $19 million boost for youth suicide prevention, including a rural youth suicide scheme. Youth suicide is part of the very ugly circumstances and pressures that descend on our young people&mdash;be they in remote and regional Australia or in the suburbs of capital city Australia&mdash;and far too many young people are going down this final path. It is something which the budget gives a particular priority to, and I welcome that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the matter of education, we have taken a number of very important steps, especially for isolated children. We are boosting the primary and secondary correspondence allowances, boosting the boarding allowance and doing the things that members opposite let drift off the pace during their years of governance in a way which added to the gaps in educational opportunity for country people in remote areas, especially compared to those in capital cities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to higher education more generally, I do follow that debate very closely and I do follow a particular centre in Western Australia, called Broome. I record the fact that a very important university, the James Cook University, headed off to Broome a few years back to set up a very worthwhile project. And did that get up the nostrils of the Perth vice&hyphen;chancellors! How could this happen? A Queensland university in Broome, Western Australia, near the Cable Beach resort? So what happens? One university goes from Perth; then a second university and a third university go from Perth to Broome so that we now have four universities in one form or another in Broome, Western Australia. That is an important provincial centre but it is a little rich that four universities&mdash;albeit not operating duplicated courses&mdash;have descended on that wonderful centre, Broome. I have never been to the Cable Beach resort but it must be very attractive to vice&hyphen;chancellors. I just hope that the steps taken by Amanda Vanstone, which I strongly support, will see that that sort of effort is dealt with.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3750">  Let me conclude by drawing attention to the remarks made by the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) on television yesterday. I have to say that country people do have good mem ories. I remind the member for Hotham of their everlasting recollection of that period when he was general secretary of the Federated Storemen and Packers Union and led his members on the infamous strike in 1980&mdash;a strike which created a lot of harm for the Australian wool industry and for many others&mdash;which he might be dismissive of but it really hurt our export effort and many of those woolgrowers. The member for Hotham can well count the numbers, and I wish him well in that regard. He might like to answer certain letters that I have sent direct to his office with regard to another matter, because it is unfinished business. As a member of this House, the member for Hotham should do better than that in regard to that particular matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The member for Hotham told Laurie Oakes yesterday that he did not feel neglected. I have to say to the member for Hotham that neglect is exactly what the people of regional Australia remember of him when he was a minister. It was the interest rate structure. It was the whole circumstance of arrogance associated with former Prime Minister Keating. You knew when the former Prime Minister was in particular bother and trouble because he would occasionally crank up a country trip&mdash;fly in, fly out, with no real communication. My record will stand up against his any day with regard to country visitation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> All in all, this budget seeks to get back on course the Australian economy which drifted so far off the pace with regard to international competitiveness during the course of Labor's stewardship. If there is one figure which, above all else, should be remembered by the Australian people, it is the fact that during the last five years of Labor the total borrowings by the federal government increased from around $30 billion to around $100 billion. In this budget there is an interest rate allocation of $10 billion simply to meet the interest on the borrowings of the federal government, thanks to Labor's legacy. We have dealt with that interest. We have closed up the deficit, by $7.2 billion, in a responsible way&mdash;an outlay reduction&mdash;while keeping schemes such as the export market development grants <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> scheme, which you said had been lost. It is a better, sharper, more focused scheme which will deliver for our exporters in a capable way.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This budget might be a matter for commendation so far as the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) is concerned, but it certainly is not for anyone else in this country. This is not a budget which deserves praise or congratulations in any measure. It is a budget for which the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the coalition leadership should be put in the political stocks and condemned and pilloried. It is not a fair budget; it is not an intelligent budget; it is not an honest budget; and it is not an economically responsible budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What Australians needed was a budget giving hope to the unemployed. What we got was a budget doing nothing to create jobs and everything to kick while they are down those presently without jobs. What Australians needed was a budget giving encouragement and confidence to the business community. What they got was a budget contracting and depressing the overall economy, tearing the heart out of public sector support for private research and development, tearing apart the key educational and training strategies designed to improve our stock of human capital in this country and tearing away assistance for small and medium sized business, not least in a number of regional areas around the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What Australians needed again was, as always, a budget of compassion and respect for the elderly, the sick, the poor and the disadvantaged. What we got was a budget inflicting pain and misery to an unprecedented extent and on an unprecedented scale to all these groups&mdash;with the most heartless out of a long list of candidates of all the measures in this budget being the decision to abolish <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3751"> the Commonwealth dental program. What the Australian community not only needed but also was entitled to expect from this government was a budget of honesty, not least given the hoopla that was articulated in the lead-up to it so far as honesty was concerned. What we got was a budget breaking at least 25 major promises and scores of lesser ones, amounting to something over $17 billion worth of broken promises&mdash;more than twice as many dollars in broken promises as were involved in kept promises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moreover, what we got was a budget of dishonesty and deception so far as middle Australia was concerned with the government putting the family tax rebate in one pocket of families but then taking out of the other&mdash;just for a start&mdash;higher child&hyphen;care costs, higher chemist bill costs, higher education fees, changed Austudy arrangements adding many fewer dollars to those otherwise eligible for Austudy and much higher than anticipated nursing home costs both by way of daily fees for the many categories of entrants and, of course, stunningly draconian up-front fees requiring on our estimate an average of $30,000 for nursing home entrants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very easy to identify lots of non-extravagant examples of how in various ways and in various combinations these additional imposts on middle Australia will overwhelmingly outrank and outweigh whatever comes into people's pocket. Let me just give one example of a two-income family with a couple of young children under five: the wife a sales assistant on around $22,000 and the husband, let us say a motor mechanic, on around $25,000 a year or $480 a week&mdash;a combined income of $47,000&mdash;with children in community based child care for 50 hours a week, and no private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What that family gets under the family tax package is $7.70 a week. What we have&mdash;just to take child care alone; do not let us talk about the chemist bills or anything else&mdash;with the removal of the operational subsidy estimated at around $21 a week as the flowthrough impact on costs per child and with the removal of the restrictions that are now there on child-care assistance amounting to a new slug of $4.25 a week for that family, is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a family that is worse off by a net $38.55 per week. That is not an extravagant example. It is an example that can be multiplied all round the country in many, many instances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we have a budget of pain, a budget of mindlessness, a budget of deceit and a budget of economic wrong&hyphen;headedness. Much of its impact is concentrated in Appropriation Bill (No. 1), which is now technically before us. Unhappily, there is a limitation on our capacity to technically amend, in the detail that we would like to, an appropriation bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we can and will do, however, so far as this bill is concerned is move a second reading amendment to spell out what ought to be understood about the government's budget strategy generally, what we think about the various outlay cuts in this particular bill and what we propose to do generally by way of other options available to us. At the end of this speech, I will move that second reading amendment, which has now been circulated in the chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth focusing in a little more detail on some of the pain, on some of the mindlessness and on some of the general lunacy of this budget. Let us focus for a start on the pain that has been caused to pensioners by the additional user charge of $6.30 a week now being imposed on the something over 200,000 frail aged who depend on the HACC scheme for meals on wheels, for home maintenance, for nursing care and for other home assistance. The average usage is around three hours a week. There are $20 a week of additional imposts involved in that particular measure alone. There is now 50c per script in additional pharmacy charges. This charge is uncompensated for&mdash;it always was in the past&mdash;by any pension increase.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is the abolition of the Commonwealth dental scheme, with stunningly widespread implications for elderly Australians and indeed many other categories of the four million Australians presently in receipt of health care cards and eligible for that assistance. Something over 500,000 Australians accessed that scheme last year. I know, from moving around the country and looking at my own electorate, what the implications of that are. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3752">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Tasmania alone, I think 14,000 people are on the waiting list at the moment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Or pulled out simply because there is no other option available because the private dentists are not willing to do things without government subsidy and the states are not willing to pick up the tab. We have got nursing home entrance fees going up in the way that I described. The access fees are making it absolutely inevitable that a very large number of people will now be forced to sell their own home.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have got unemployed suffering a whole variety of nasty new impositions under the social security system. We have got labour market programs being cut by nearly $2 billion. As a result, 230,000 Australians of all ages are being denied the training, the skilling and the assistance in terms of personal confidence and job readiness that they need to get access to work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have got migrants suffering not only the familiar burden that we have known about for a long time but also, with the two&hyphen;year waiting period for benefits, English language course fees are now being increased to $5,500, a 250 per cent increase. We have got the Aboriginal programs being slashed by $400 million with implications that I have seen with my own eyes all around the country&mdash;not least recently in Devonport with the Mersey&hyphen;Leven project. There is a mere $75,000 involved in keeping afloat a community and youth support centre there, which has made a massive impact, according to the police and local community workers, on keeping the morale of that community afloat, community relations alive, and the confidence, pride and the heritage of young Aboriginal people alive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is all now gone by a government that just does not given a damn about the pain that it is causing for poor and disadvantaged Australians. We have got the mindlessness of an <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> approach in this budget which tears apart the human capital formation process as we have been developing and as this country needed it to be developed in the education system, with the impact now of HECS and Austudy changes, and the labour market programs I just talked about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have got the research and development base of the country being torn apart by the removal of $2.2 billion worth of assistance in syndication and by the 150 per cent coming back to 125 per cent with impacts which have been experienced by businesses, particularly the small to medium sized ones, all around the country. Tasmania Alkaloids&mdash;again another example in Tassie that I visited just a few days ago&mdash;were contemplating with the support of their parent the establishment of a centre of excellence in pharmaceutical research into opiates. The key point is the marginal cost of that with the 150 per cent deduction being available. When it comes down to 125 per cent, that is gone&mdash;and that story is being repeated all over the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Small and medium enterprises need the support of Austrade, Ausindustry, the EMDG scheme in full flight, the ITES scheme and the rest of the schemes that have now been either capped or abandoned. They need to be able to go to court without having their fees for simple trade practices matters increased from $1,100 to $12,400, for a start. They need the support in the regions around Australia of the kind of seed money that was an indispensable part of our strategy of assistance to small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We heard about the supermarket to Asia being talked about most recently by the Deputy Prime Minister. There is not much left of the supermarket to Asia concept in Cairns at the moment. There was a proposal to have Commonwealth seed money under the regional development scheme of just $2 million in order to enable the establishment of a refrigeration, a bulking up and a marketing and distribution operation at Cairns airport between the Commonwealth and the Cairns Port Authority&mdash;a total cost of $4 million, the Commonwealth bearing half of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was designed to fill the bodies of those 50 international flights going to Asia each <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3753"> week, which are full of nothing but tourists' suitcases at the moment, with produce from small producers from the Atherton Tableland, up and down the coast from Cape York down to Mackay, and the fishermen out to sea who did not have the capital to establish the capacity to market in this way. With the $2 million taken out in this budget mindlessly and stupidly we now have lost a $240 million export opportunity. That story can be repeated in Whyalla and Port Pirie and again with the Tasmanian wheat silo proposal. This has strangled at birth the development of an infant grain industry in Tasmania. These are examples that can be repeated all over the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have got the story of deception, which I have referred to, particularly in the context of middle Australia. The biggest deception of all is in the basic economic strategy of this budget. The biggest betrayal of all is of jobless Australians. It has to be remembered that it is middle Australians who are increasingly jobless Australians&mdash;not some underclass out there. Joblessness is all around us in middle and mainstream Australia. It is our biggest problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The approach of this whole budget is absolutely wrong&hyphen;headed in its fundamental economic strategy. In the 10 minutes I have remaining, let me put it very simply this way: Australia's biggest problem is unemployment&mdash;no ifs, no buts, no maybes. The rate of unemployment is 8&half; per cent at the moment. 770,000 Australians are unemployed and from Social Security calculations, there are 829,000 unemployment beneficiaries. That situation was under control with the Labor government. Four years of four per cent plus sustainable growth with low inflation had brought, over the last three years, 700,000 new jobs into creation. It had brought the unemployment rate down from 11 per cent to 8&half; per cent, putting us well on the way to achieving that medium term target of five per cent by the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> That situation is now already out of control under this coalition government. The budget papers&mdash;working as they have to now from a base of subdued, depressed confidence in the community and a base of a massively contractionary budgetary strategy&mdash;are now project ing no more than 3&half; per cent growth right through to the turn of the century, and no less than 8&half; per cent unemployment this year, 8&frac14; per cent next year and silence after that. The silence, of course, was broken by Senator Vanstone last week. She let the cat out of the bag when she acknowledged that the rate of unemployment could well be worse than eight per cent by the turn of the century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister will not set a target. Faced with this overwhelming evidence of the size of this economic problem, the coalition strategy is to say, `That is not our biggest problem. Our biggest problem is debt and deficit. That is what we have got to devote our attentions to.' Let me say frankly, directly, deliberately: that is nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">International comparisons make the point more abundantly, clearly and succinctly than anything else I could possibly say. In the OECD, we in Australia presently have the fourth lowest debt in the industrialised world and we have the equal third lowest budget deficit in the industrialised world. The European Monetary Union, the ground rules for which were laid down a few years ago, specified requirements for economic standards to be met so far as debt and deficit as being no more than three per cent of GDP for the national deficit and no more than 60 per cent of GDP taken up in national debt. Australia easily meets those standards. Even on current worst case assumptions about our deficit, it is no more at the moment than two per cent of GDP, one full percentage point better than the European standard. Our national debt at the moment is only half that European standard of good economic housekeeping. It is only around 30 per cent, the Commonwealth debt being around 20 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We satisfy the standard which has been widely accepted internationally as the measure of integrity, rectitude, quality of a particular economy. Do you know how many European countries satisfy the European Monetary Union standard? The answer is one&mdash;one European country. Which one is it? Luxembourg. But this is the kind of message that this coalition government is trying to project&mdash;that the Australian economy is somehow <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3754"> in deep, dire trouble so far as debt and deficit are concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not saying in all of this&mdash;I make it clear again for the record&mdash;that we should not address what is obviously a national saving problem, both for the private and the public sector. We need to do more privately; we are doing it with the superannuation scheme. We do need to target, over time, reduction in government dissaving; we do need to target budget balance. But we say we can get to budget balance within a reasonable time&mdash;in fact, within the lifetime of this parliament, by 1998&hyphen;99&mdash;with a much less savage budget strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we say is very simply this: we can get to balance by 1998-99&mdash;the third year of this parliament&mdash;by an economic strategy which is a continuation of the strategy in our years of government which, very simply, puts growth and employment first. If you do not take nearly $8 billion out of the economy by a savagely contractionary process of this kind&mdash;if you do not contract the economy in that way&mdash;you can grow, as we did for the last three or four years, at four per cent plus. That means not only more jobs being created, more private income and more saving in the private sector as a result but also more government revenue, less government outlays, and better government deficits each year than would otherwise have been the case, and more manageable fiscal consolidation targets. We say that we could get to budget balance under that kind of a scenario, with those sorts of assumptions about growth, by merely continuing what we were able to achieve before. We can get to that by targeting savings of no more than $3 billion by that third year. That is the order of magnitude of the pain involved when you have a task of that kind compared with the pain involved in this task; it is absolutely, self-evidently, utterly different.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our approach to opposing individual measures in this budget very simply should be seen in this context. We have looked at the individual merits of each particular matter, making a judgment based on a combination of the policy pros and cons, combined with our capacity technically in this parliament to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> oppose it. Looked at that way, we are prepared to oppose to the point of defeat in this parliament $425 million worth of fiscal consolidation measures this year, the first year, and a total of $7.3 billion over the next four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to the retort that this is all terribly irresponsible, I will make some simple comparisons&mdash;not odious in this instance. The coalition's approach in 1993 was to target $1.4 billion&mdash;not $425 million&mdash;in the first year and a total of $10.2 billion over the four years. In 1995, it was $1.95 billion in the first year. In 1993, it was in a context where there was a genuine alarm about the potential explosion of the deficit, which was assessed as adding up to $15 billion by 1995-96 if there were no other policy measures taken. That is utterly different from the situation at this stage where, on the government's own figures, the deficit is largely self&hyphen;correcting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the issue is one of the impact of all of this on interest rates, the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Bernie Fraser, has made the point starkly, clearly, loudly, lucidly that there is no short&hyphen;term connection between fiscal outcomes and interest rates. In March he said, `There can be no presumption at this time of any trade&hyphen;off between fiscal restraint and interest rate reductions, certainly not in the short term.' The basic point is simply this: the less you cut from the budget, the less stress you put on growth, the more chance there is of the economy growing; the reduced size then follows in the fiscal deficit task and you can reach balance without pain. There is no magic or voodoo about it. It is simple commonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget that this coalition has delivered is overwhelmingly an ideological budget. It makes the case for cuts not on the ground of any economic rationality or economic necessity but on the ground of cuts for cuts' sake, cuts for small government's sake. This is a budget of unnecessary and utterly unfair pain. It is a budget of mindlessness so far as its impact on business Australia is concerned. It is a budget of deceit so far as Australians generally are concerned, and it is a budget of economic wrong&hyphen;headedness. It is a budget of betrayal for every Australia. It is a budget of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3755"> despair, in particular, for jobless Australians and those who fear they may become so.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to have the opportunity to lead the backbench members tonight in supporting the Howard government's first budget. One of the major reasons that drove me to stand for election was the desire to help put Australia <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> back on track, to restore prudent financial management, to set conditions that will bring prosperity to the country and to return representation to mainstream Australia. This budget does just that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget carries the mark of a Treasurer (Mr Costello) who knew what was needed to be done and accepted responsibility for making the right and necessary changes. This budget is also a tribute to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). He has made decisions based on principle rather than on political expediency. He did what was right in the national interest. These are the marks of a truly great leader. Mainstream Australia is finally being listened to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is now a matter of record that the previous government managed to turn a headline surplus of $718 million in their last budget into a deficit of $10.3 billion. At the same time, despite a promise not to put up tax, they delivered tax increase after tax increase. There were increases in wholesale sales tax, increases in petrol and tobacco tax, increases in departure tax, increases in the Medicare levy, increased tax on motor vehicles and so on&mdash;in all, $13.4 billion worth of new taxes. Put this together with Labor's promise in 1990 that there would be no government debt, domestic or external, and you have an opposition with no valid credentials to be critical of this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On August 29, just nine days after the budget was delivered, an article appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier Mail</EMPHASIS> under the headline `Labor neglected Queensland at its peril: Beazley'. The article opened with:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The former Keating government has been punished for paying too much attention to the golden triangle of Sydney&hyphen;Canberra&hyphen;Melbourne, Federal Opposition Leader Kim Beazley said yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He said the impact of the March federal election result on the Queensland ALP had been a tragedy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We kept Arch (Bevis) and Dave (Beddall), but what we lost was almost beyond calculation, he said.</PARA>
<PARA>What an extraordinary admission. It is extraordinary because such a statement cannot reflect well on either the performance or ability of the former Queensland ALP members who lost their seats in the March election <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3757"> whitewash. The next part of that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS>  article was simply insulting. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That means we need to get people like Michael (Lavarch), Wayne (Swan), and Kevin (Rudd) and others back.</PARA>
<PARA>Why? So you can misrepresent and completely ignore Queenslanders all over again. The member for Moreton (Mr Hardgrave) understands this. These are the same people who failed Queensland the last time round. You would want to put them back in there again for a chance to fail Queensland a second time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take this opportunity to respond to the offer of the Leader of the Opposition this morning to oppose the rise in the reef levy. Thank you, but neither I nor my North Queensland coalition members and Senate colleagues need the help of anyone with such a poor record in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition leader's admission that Labor failed Queensland was extraordinary. In fact, the only other more extraordinary admission the opposition could make is the apology they owe all of Australia&mdash;the apology they owe the Australian public for telling them right up to the close of voting on 2 March that the 1995-96 forecasts were absolutely correct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Time after time the former government was asked to open their books and to come clean about the real financial state of affairs, but they did not. Perhaps they did not because they did not want the Australian people to know that the economy was in underlying deficit to the tune of some $8 billion. To quote from the document entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Charter of budget honesty</EMPHASIS> prepared by the Treasurer:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the right of the Australian people to be fully informed about the current state of the Government's finances and the future outlook . . . The proposed legislation will prevent future governments going to an election on the basis of misleading information on the fiscal and economic outlook. It will ensure that at all times governments can be held properly to account for their fiscal and economic policies.</PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps it was just as well the former government did not come clean. Had they come clean, the ALP might not have had any seats north of Bankstown. It would be just left to Senator Reynolds to run around Queensland <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> shouting, `The sky is falling, the sky is falling.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This brings me to my next point. Since the budget a number of shadow ministers have passed through Townsville and North Queensland. The term `opposition' has never been applied more appropriately than to the honourable members opposite. They seem set on talking down confidence in business, confidence in investment, confidence in our families, in our youth, in our elderly citizens, and they seem hell&hyphen;bent on talking confidence down in Australia generally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members opposite should be asking themselves: to what end are we doing this? Are they doing this to so scare the Australian people with a campaign of misinformation and, in some cases, outright untruths that they will not vote for the coalition at the next election? If that is their tactic then you have to ask yourself: what price are the ALP willing to pay to get back into government?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the way the opposition is talking and from the fear campaign they are running, it would seem that the ALP is willing to gamble the lot. They are willing to gamble away Australia's economic recovery, employment growth and investment confidence in businesses big and small. Where does opposition end and responsible opposition begin?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To date the Australian people have seen no responsibility from the opposition at all. On 22 August, the Treasurer stood in this House and said that the Leader of the Opposition had to include a coherent budget strategy in his speech in reply to the budget and declare how the opposition would set about reducing the budget deficit in the three years espoused by the shadow Treasurer just days before the budget was delivered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where in the opposition leader's speech in reply was the ALP strategy for deficit reduction? Where was the ALP strategy for economic growth in Australia? Where was any encouragement offered to small business to invest, to grow and to employ our youth? Where was the strategy to reform the labour market programs that had failed so many Australians and had sent many from one training program to another with no job in sight? Where was the opposition leader's <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3758"> commitment to doing away with the crippling unfair dismissal laws he helped shackle like leg irons to the ankles of employers throughout Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of these elements went AWOL from the opposition leader's speech on 22 August. Since then, the only thing that he has offered the people of Queensland is to bring back former members who failed them so miserably last time around. If that is the best the ALP can offer Queensland, the ALP are going to be in opposition for a very long time indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Townsville Chamber of Commerce, Townsville Enterprise, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Townsville Bulletin</EMPHASIS> and the Thuringowa City Council showed the initiative all Australia needs when on 22 August they sent out a non&hyphen;political message in the form of a full&hyphen;page newspaper advertisement which says, `Come on North Queensland. There is life after the budget. Let's get on with business.' The opposition should pay attention. They might learn a thing or two about responsibility. From the way people such as Senator Margaret Reynolds, Mike Reynolds and the former member for Herbert have been speaking in the lead&hyphen;up to the budget, I am sure they got the fright of their lives when they woke up on the morning after the budget to discover that Townsville and, indeed, Australia had not ceased to exist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yes, there is life after the budget and for the Herbert electorate and North Queensland that life will be a prosperous one. In terms of development opportunities, the potential is enormous. At the Townsville 2000 luncheon shortly after the budget was delivered, the Townsville business community heard from the Chamber of Commerce President, Mal Missingham, that our regional economy stood on the threshold of an unprecedented era of economic growth; that the Townsville regional economy would more than double over the next two decades.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Based on data supplied from the Centre of Applied Economic Research and Analysis at James Cook University, Mal Missingham told the audience that the next 10 years would account for $3.5 billion of the $5.6 billion worth of expected regional growth. Just part of that growth will involve a project which <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> has suffered from the neglect of successive governments and one which needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency. The project I refer to is better known in my electorate as the Woolcock Street project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An in globo amount of money was provided in the budget for new work on the national highway. There was no breakdown as to how this money would be spent. I understand that the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) will allocate priorities within the next two weeks. It is absolutely vital that Townsville receive funding for the urgently needed upgrade of the northern approaches to our city. Councillor Les Tyrell, Mayor of Thuringowa City, sent me a letter this morning which quite accurately sums up the feeling of Townsville. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An indication in last week's media that the Woolcock Street/Bruce Highway extension may not proceed this financial year has sent shock waves through the communities of Townsville and Thuringowa.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Woolcock Street extension has been a topic of conversation for something like 25 years, when it was first announced it would proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The residents of the twin cities are fed up with the ongoing promises and the arbitrary breaking of those promises in relation to the Woolcock Street extension of the Bruce highway.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current right angle bend where the four laning stops is one of the blackest of black spots in the country. It is intolerable that the standard of the Bruce Highway at this location is such.</PARA>
<PARA>These are strong words from the mayor, but they are appropriate and I support them 100 per cent. Despite the rhetoric and promises from the previous government and the former member for Herbert, the minister's office has informed me that the former government never signed off on the project. It is vital that this government now does what is needed. Townsville must receive funding for this project; and it must receive it now. The minister will again find me on his doorstep this week. I will present him with the huge feedback I have received on this matter from the electorate. Now is the time for our government to deliver with a positive decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to turn now to another Townsville facility that is unique in Australia. I refer to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3759"> the National Centre for Multidisciplinary Studies of Back Pain at the Townsville General Hospital. The centre deals with the problem of low back pain, which affects some 80 per cent to 90 per cent of the population at some time during their adult lives. I visited the centre on two occasions. It is a marvellously well run centre. Certainly, in talking to the patients as I have, I have found they have every confidence in the centre because they have been elsewhere and have not had any result. They have been told they have no back pain but they know the problems that they have and this centre has been able to take up where others have left off&mdash;and has solved the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The centre achieves marvellous success rates in treating patients because it combines traditional methods with acupuncture and chiropractic medicine. As well, it conducts research which has the potential for reducing the vast expenditure on compensation payments and lost productivity. The centre was established with the assistance of James Cook University which has provided establishment and salary funding up to the end of this year. That funding must now be replaced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fortunately, in this year's budget there is a new musculoskeletal initiative which will provide $400,000 for centres in each state. This Townsville centre deserves federal government support to continue its groundbreaking work in this field. It truly offers unequalled conditions for comprehensive diagnosis, management and research into spinal musculoskeletal pain syndromes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not all budget measures have been received favourably in my electorate&mdash;notably the increase in the reef levy. The proposed reef levy increase has gravely concerned the tourism industry in my area and throughout North Queensland. Many public statements have been made on this issue and I believe there are justifiable grounds for reconsideration by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not realistic or fair to impose a levy without warning on an industry that presells its product. The result is that the operator has to absorb the new charge, probably wiping out the profit on the ticket. To add insult, the operators are facing the prospect of paying <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> commission on the collection of the levy. From the users' point of view, they face paying the $6 charge every time they purchase a marine park activity ticket. For a family of two adults and two children doing three activities in a day the total levy would be $72.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to another issue. While the ABC has taken its fair share of the cut in the budget, I am not prepared to see the implementation of this measure occurring at the expense of rural and regional Australia. Indeed, the investment in the Townsville studios of the ABC should be used to produce more regional output, particularly in news and current affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ABC should also examine the possibility of using its television facilities, presently unused, to reintroduce a local five&hyphen;minute TV news service before the national news. The ABC should not be abrogating its responsibility to provide such services. Commercial carriers either cannot or will not provide the types of services to regional Australia that the ABC can. It is beyond all reasoning that the Mansfield review is going to Cairns but not <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3760"> to Townsville when the facilities for regional Queensland are located in Townsville.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The federal budget has been received in Herbert just as it has been received throughout Australia, as tough but responsible and fair. James Cook University student Matt Taylor strongly believes that HECS is the best value for money loan in Australia. Matt said to me on Saturday night, `Where else can you get a loan that requires no repayment until you earn sufficient money to make the payments?' The loan carries no interest component, and repayments stop automatically if you are out of work. I ask members present: what other loan would allow you to do that? A tertiary education is an investment for life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other Herbert constituents, such as Ted Bracken of Pimlico and landscape architect Wal Smith, have commented to me on the fairness and responsibility of the budget. Taxi driver Brian Boswell said that the need to boost the number of people accessing private health insurance was a hot topic of conversation in his cab, and one that the Labor Party might well take note of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The federal budget has delivered for all these people. The family tax initiative, private health rebates, the introduction of Medicare services through selected pharmacy outlets, incentives to small business through the reduction in the provisional tax rate, the freeing up of the capital gains tax, and the introduction of the modern Australian apprenticeship and traineeship system which will clear the path to real jobs for our young people&mdash;these are ways in which the coalition has delivered to families, our youth and small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Matt Taylors and Ted Brackens of Queensland and elsewhere in Australia have recognised the fact that the coalition did not create our current economic problems. They recognise that the coalition has taken the responsibility for fixing the problems of the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has the opposition offered Queensland, and no doubt the rest of Australia? They have offered to put back in the very same who failed them the last time round. Bravo, Mr Beazley, bravo&mdash;but no thanks.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is with some pride that I speak in the parliament tonight. Back in July of last year I had no intention of being a member of the federal parliament.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, the 1996 budget reveals the way in which the Howard government is testing our traditional understanding of morality in this nation's public affairs. Its political agenda is more interested in the people it can hurt than the people it can help.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After a decade of economic and social restructuring we have entered a period of political restructuring. The political majority&mdash;what the Prime Minister, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), calls the mainstream&mdash;are having their interests defined not so much by what government can directly do for them but by the things government can take away from so&hyphen;called minorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The emergence of an open post&hyphen;industrial economy has reshaped Australia's social and political agenda. It is unusual now to find issues and interests defined by a clear division between capital and labour. We have very much become a 30, 40, 30 society: 30 per cent of citizens with competitive skills, high productivity and growing incomes; another 40 per cent who have jobs but not job security, a newly insecure middle group who face the uncertainty of industrial restructuring and reskilling; plus a bottom 30 per cent of citizens essentially outside the production process. This new structure is challenging most of the values and assumptions on which the inclusiveness of our society has been based.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recall the 1960s and 1970s as decades in which there was a general assumption that the greatest threat to the working class in Australia came from unbridled privilege and wealth. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3761"> Now a growing proportion of newly insecure workers see their interests being threatened not by people in groups above them on the social ladder but by those below&mdash;welfare recipients, the unemployed, and so on&mdash;generally, people outside the system of production.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In part, this involves the perception of double standards in the entitlement system of the welfare state&mdash;the middle group exposed to continuous change and certainty in the workplace, while other citizens are perceived as recipients of guaranteed government income. It also reflects what Marshall McLuhan described as the hot features of the electronic media. Television and, to some extent, radio rely on conflict and confrontation as the basis of popular entertainment, portraying winners and losers, majority and minority interests in every story.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is why the Paxton family is better known in Australia than the Governor&hyphen;General's family. This is why the electronic media spends so much time stereotyping unemployed people, Aborigines and welfare recipients. Just as the Romans had the Colosseum, and Tudor England the village square stocks, we have ACA with Ray.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Howard is the first Australian political leader to set about the active exploitation of these trends. Never before has an Australian government made such a virtue and public spectacle of taking things away from people. Each of the deliberate cabinet leaks and set piece media announcements of the Howard government has been designed to punish so&hyphen;called minorities&mdash;restrictions on migrant benefits, cuts to universities, evidence of welfare abuse, introduction of dole diaries, and savage cuts to Aboriginal funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is what the Prime Minister means by mainstream values and political incorrectness. The policies of his government are not able to positively assist the interests of insecure workers. Indeed, the introduction of individual employment contracts, further micro-economic reform and the social wage cuts underpinning this budget actively work against their interests and economic security. Rather, Mr Howard's electoral pitch is to share the focus and prejudices of this middle group. In part, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this reflects the Americanisation of Australian politics, with a shift from structural policy reform and outcomes to a strategy of value&hyphen;laden empathy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In truth, however, the greatest threat to the middle group comes from interests above them on the social ladder&mdash;not from below. By my assessment, Labor has no more important a task in this parliament than arguing this case&mdash;that is, to mount the policies and political attack which demonstrate that economic injustice in Australia is more likely a product of lavish executive salaries than an Aboriginal family living in North Queensland; that financial waste and privilege are more likely a product of anti-competitive business practices than a single mum living in a public housing estate in Campbelltown in my electorate; that economic insecurity is more likely caused by the Treasurer's big business mates in Collins Street, Melbourne than the long-term unemployed; that economic injustice is more likely caused by corporate crooks and tax avoiders than newly arrived migrants. But most of all the real threat to the newly insecure middle group in society comes not from below but from above.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In its first budget the Howard government has shown that it has just two policies: taxing and axing. There has been a lot of axing and many Australians, especially the disadvantaged, will be hurt, but it is the taxing which hits lower and middle income earners hardest. In his first budget, the member for Higgins, the Treasurer (Mr Costello), has revealed himself as much more a taxer than an axer. His increased taxes and charges strike at the heart of Australian families, with the reintroduction of university fees plus higher and earlier HECS repayments, paying more every time they go to the chemist, higher health charges estimated by the AMA&mdash;I am sure the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) will verify this&mdash;to leave an average family $200 worse off per annum, higher child-care fees and reduced fee relief for working families plus a massive increase in nursing home charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government claims to have offered tax relief, yet for average PAYE taxpayers income tax will increase by 9.1 per cent in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3762"> 1996-97; that is, for every $100 in tax paid to the Keating government, they will pay $109.10 to the Howard government. Where is the relief in that? Where is the relief in increasing income tax revenue by a whopping $5.5 billion?  Where is the relief in major revenue measures in this budget which have a net impact of $1 billion this year and $2 billion the following financial year? Where is the relief in increasing Commonwealth tax revenue by nearly half a per cent of GDP?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under this government there is no relief. It is all pain and no gain&mdash;no gain for the ordinary taxpayer; just more taxing and axing. It is just taxing lower and middle income earners and axing the services&mdash;the child care, the universities, the Austudy, the hospitals, the dental health program and the employment programs on which their families rely. Even if young people still manage after all of that to get a start in life and find a job, they face the prospect of a youth wage of less than $2 an hour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not often that a government breaks commitments on both sides of an election. The member for Bennelong has now broken scores of election promises, and they stand condemned on his public record. Not so well known, however, are the commitments the Treasurer has broken since the election. This is a new level of immorality in Australian public life: breaking promises after the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 12 March Mr Costello, at his first press conference as Treasurer, said that the coalition's election commitments have been fully funded. In truth, they had not been. The budget papers reveal that the coalition's unfunded election policies left a $2 billion hole in its own fiscal consolidation task over three years. On 12 March the Treasurer said he would not cut general assistance grants to the states, yet at the Premiers Conference in June he used the threat of a $1 billion sales tax impost on the states to extract from them a $1.5 billion cut in financial assistance grants over three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 12 March Mr Costello said he would not introduce new taxes or increase existing taxes. His budget breaches that commitment not once, not twice, not three times, not four <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> times, not five times but six times. Six times he has broken taxation promises. On 12 March Mr Costello said there would be no forced redundancies in the Commonwealth Public Service. Today thousands of workers face the sack.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 12 March, after the election, Mr Costello said that fiscal consolidation would be achieved overwhelmingly through revenue reductions, yet his budget lists a net $2 billion worth of major revenue measures over the next two years&mdash;the equivalent of 31 per cent of the fiscal consolidation program. On 12 March the Treasurer said that $8 billion of net spending cuts were needed to improve Australia's national savings. His budget delivers, at face value at least, $5.2 billion over two years&mdash;around one per cent of GDP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">History can now record that the talk of an $8 billion problem was simply an attempt by the new government to establish an alibi for resurrecting large slabs of the Liberal Party's Fightback manifesto. On 12 March Mr Costello said his budget would resolve the current account deficit, yet the Treasury, his own department, has forecast only a marginal decline in the current account deficit, stuck at four per cent of GDP for 1996-97&mdash;all this despite a continued improvement in the terms of trade and a 0.75 per cent gap between Australia's forecast economic growth and that of our major trading partners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By his own fiscal strategy, by his own B-grade melodrama on 12 March, the Treasurer's first budget is a spectacular bellyflop. He set the outlays bar at eight feet and then jumped right under it&mdash;not a Fosbury flop but a bellyflop. The member for Higgins has set an Australian record for breaking promises before and after an election. His integrity is doubly damned&mdash;breaching scores of promises made to the Australian people before 2 March, then failing each of the expectations he personally set for economic policy on 12 March.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only that, but on the way through his net spending cuts and revenue measures have left the average Australian family $700 worse off. The punters in the House will recognise a unique trifecta: a budget of betrayal, a budget of bellyflops and a budget delivering <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3763"> pain with no gain for working families. For the budget's pain, where are the gains in the macro economy?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Shortly after the election the Prime Minister admitted that he had `inherited an Australian economy that was a little better than just good in parts. We have had 19 quarters of positive economic growth and low levels of inflation.' This budget&mdash;for all its pain, for each of its broken promises and for its failure to meet the market expectations personally set by the Treasurer&mdash;fails to make any of the parts of the economy better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact economic and employment growth are forecast to fall. The rates of unemployment and inflation are unchanged. My estimate is that, given the scale of public sector job cuts and the capital intensive nature of the output growth sectors&mdash;mining, farming and communications&mdash;unemployment will actually exceed nine per cent this financial year. The current account deficit remains anchored at four per cent GDP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On interest rates, the Reserve Bank has already ruled out a cut on the basis of fiscal policy. The bank has repeatedly stated that there is no immediate trade-off between monetary policy and fiscal policy. It appears that Bernie Fraser would much rather have an exchange of letters with the Australian trade union movement than with the Commonwealth Treasurer, Mr Costello.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1996 budget is a failure because it relies on failed economic dogma. It reflects the coalition's wasted years in opposition and its inability to fashion a reform program outside the shortcomings of orthodox economic theory. The member for Higgins is simply a mouthpiece for each of these shortcomings. No-one has ever brought less original policy work or thinking on the economy to the treasury bench. No Treasurer has ever pinned his entire budget strategy so thoroughly to a single, essentially flawed economic theory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At Monash University, of course, Mr Costello was part of the evangelical union. Treasury has now given him a new gospel to sing; it is called the twin deficits theory. This argues that a reduction in the federal budget deficit would automatically reduce the current account deficit. It relies on an assumption that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> an increase in public savings will increase national savings, which will in turn close the gap between national savings and investment and thereby lower the current account deficit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is essential, of course, in any aspect of economic analysis to close the gap between theory and practice. The chronic nature of Australia's current account deficit in itself indicates substantial market failures. In theory, our floating exchange rate should fall to a level which clears the deficit. Over the past 12 months our dollar has actually strengthened, indicating that foreigners remain more than willing to fund the excess of Australia's investment over national savings. Yet the same Treasury economists who urge massive public sector cuts have no explanation as to why the exchange rate is so far out of line with what they would otherwise call the market fundamentals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are three core flaws in the Treasurer's twin deficits theory. First, recent history in Australia has shown that it does not automatically work. In the late 1980s the Treasury elevated the twin deficits to the Holy Grail of national economic policy, yet deep cuts to federal spending were associated with increases in the current account deficit. Internationally, the same problem has arisen. New Zealand has forecast a budget operating surplus of nearly three per cent for this financial year yet a current account deficit of over five per cent GDP. In Malaysia a comfortable budget surplus and a national savings rate of more than 30 per cent has produced a current account deficit of nearly nine per cent GDP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This statistical evidence of course highlights the second flaw in the twin deficits theory&mdash;that is, it makes no allowance for a surge in national investment. This is the key contradiction in Mr Costello's budget strategy&mdash;saying that the core objective of policy is to reduce the current account deficit, yet talking up confidence effects as the basis for a surge in business investment. Even if fiscal consolidation produced a gain in national savings, a comparable increase in national investment would leave the current account deficit unaltered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the current account deficit is such a problem, why is the Treasurer boasting of a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3764"> forecast 14 per cent increase in business investment for 1996-97? He is simply repeating the experience of the 1980s, when net public sector borrowing was replaced by higher private borrowing, leaving the underlying trend in foreign debt unaltered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third flaw in the twin deficits theory concerns the high replacement effect in Australia between public savings and private savings. In a developed nation such as ours, with a strong culture of consumption, improvements in public savings are often associated with the decline in private savings. Even the Treasury in budget paper No. 1, page 1-30, notes that `both the IMF and OECD have recently published reports which suggest that the private sector tends to compensate in part for changes to public sector saving.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1996 budget is absolutely rife with substitution effects of this kind. Most of the $2 billion revenue gains reflect a straight transfer from private savings to public savings, without any net gain in national savings. Two of the measures achieve even less. First, the new superannuation levy will push funds from super savings into fringe benefits, negative gearing and tax shelter schemes. The net impact will be a transfer from national savings to non-productive consumption and property investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Second, the new Medicare levy on high income earners can achieve nothing more than a transfer from private savings into the already bloated reserves of the private health funds. The tax rebates for private insurance effectively transfer resources from the public sector to these reserves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the outlays side, Australians are unlikely to lower their consumption of basic education, child care, health,  pharmaceutical and nursing home services solely on the basis that the federal government has made them more expensive. In a nation accustomed to first&hyphen;world services, these items form part of the absolute essentials for family life. As such, they are price inelastic and subject to large substitution effects between public and private expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other budget cuts simply reflect public to public outlay shuffling. The $1.6 billion cut in state grants, for instance, is a straight <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> transfer from state to federal savings performance. Even among outlays without substitution effects, such as administrative efficiencies, the ED and the like, the government's tightening is based on some fairly rubbery figures and forecasts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Overall, the 1996 budget does not add substantially to national savings. It features the worst flaws and folly of the twin deficits theory. Even the Treasurer and his department have been absolutely unwilling to quantify the budget's consolidated impact on national savings&mdash;that is, having made national savings the key goal of economic policy, they are not prepared, among the 700-odd pages of the budget documents, to report to the Australian people on their satisfaction of that goal. So much for a charter of budget honesty!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The more I think of Australia's national savings, the more I believe that the issues are cultural and the answers prescriptive. Orthodox economics has no greater failing than its treatment of cultural influences as external to the workings of a market economy. This is because last century economics was deemed to be a science, with its analysis best guided by a series of mathematical formulas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today someone like Vince FitzGerald can talk for hours about national savings without mentioning Australia's cultural features. He is more likely to demonise the Whitlam government than mention the way in which every signal from the mass media points our society towards mass consumption.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a nation, Australians have not been known for a culture of long-term planning and personal thrift. For many decades, the `lucky country' ethos promoted attitudes to wealth creation heavily reliant on commodity and property development. Elements of a hedonistic lifestyle have promoted the virtues of spending now and worrying later&mdash;best reflected in the `she'll be right' approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Accordingly, the debate about the correct balance between national savings and national investment needs to be refocused from the public to the private sector. It needs to be understood that the decline in public savings since the 1970s has been accompanied by a fall in public investment, ensuring that the net <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3765"> public sector borrowing requirement has remained reasonably stable. The greatest impact on national savings in recent years has come from the secular decline in private savings with the household ratio, net savings as a proportion of disposable income, falling from 7.5 per cent in 1990 to just two per cent earlier this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Close examination of Budget Paper No. 1 confirms this pattern across the longer term. Since the early 1970s, public sector net lending has declined by three per cent GDP while household savings has fallen by eight per cent. On an international comparison of private and public net lending performance over the past decade, the Treasury notes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . private sector net lending in Australia has been consistently negative, indicating that private sector saving has fallen short of private sector investment. In contrast, private sector lending in the United States has been positive, or at worst marginally negative, and, for industrial countries on average, it has been positive.</PARA>
<PARA>For public sector net lending, Australia's performance has exceeded the United States and been far superior to the industrial countries' average. Treasury's conclusion, however, resembles a piece of Orwellian doublespeak:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since Australia has a saving shortfall from the private sector, the public sector cannot draw on national savings.</PARA>
<PARA>That is, private savings may be the problem but Treasury only ever recommends public sector cuts as the answer. Shame on them and shame on the government and its 1996 budget. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fact of the matter is that this budget is a strong budget and it is a fair budget, no matter how it is represented by the Australian Labor Party. They are a failed government and a failed party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even their shadow Treasurer feels that he is lost and irrelevant in the Australian political scene. The political landscape of Australia without Gareth Evans, I am sure, is something that is appreciated by everybody. The irrelevance of the shadow Treasurer is even acknowledged by himself. One has only to cast one's eyes over the budget cuts proposed by the Labor Party to understand really just what a mess they are in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John Howard during this week stepped up pressure on the Democrats to have them also join in with the government in acknowledging that there is fairness and strength in this budget. But the Australian Labor Party is following the coat trailed by the Democrats in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> order to oppose any issue whatsoever. One only has to look back at some of the comments made both by the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Cheryl Kernot, and by the former Prime Minister to understand just how far they have come in their attempts to mislead and disrupt the Australian economy and the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In an interview with Peter Thompson and John Shovelan on Wednesday, 18 August 1993, just after the 1993 budget, Cheryl Kernot spoke of how she would keep the government honest. In that interview, in reference to blocking the budget, she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am leaving it open. I think it is irresponsible just to sit here now and say I'm going to block. I prefer to look at the national interest.</PARA>
<PARA>That is something I would advise both the Australian Labor Party and the Democrats to do straightaway. She continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think it is much more important than the sort of political points scoring that is going on with the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, that is exactly what is happening now as the Democrats and the Australian Labor Party seek to block aspects of the budget with which they disagree. I think it is most unfortunate that they would want to do this so soon after an election, so soon after the government, which has moved strongly to keep to its promises, has followed through and presented a budget which on all accounts is well accepted by the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Cheryl Kernot in that interview, when asked by John Shovelan about misleading the parliament and about her remarks and those of the Australian Labor Party, went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But again to me, it's not quite as important as doing something about our long&hyphen;term economic future and doing something to reduce the deficit is something that we should be looking at.</PARA>
<PARA>When the first opportunity is offered with a budget where there is a chance for the Democrats and their leader to fulfil their commitment, the Leader of the Democrats is going to walk away from that commitment, that statement of three years ago to do something about our long&hyphen;term economic future. She is walking away from doing something to reduce the deficit and something that she said the Democrats should be looking at. The Austral <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3767"> ian Labor Party has done the same thing. In fact, when John Shovelan said, `Are you saying it doesn't really matter that they haven't followed their political election promise to the letter?' she responded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">John, I don't think anybody believes anything that any politicians say in election campaigns. I regret that, but I think we've reached that stage in Australian politics. And did you hear anybody actually debating tax cuts in the election campaign? They talked about the GST, they talked about Medicare, they talked about industrial relations changes. I don't think for once that sort of hip&hyphen;pocket approach in terms of how much I'm going to get in tax cuts was as important as the overall taxation debate on the GST.</PARA>
<PARA>Those are the comments made by the Leader of the Democrats, following an election campaign where the then Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me tell you something that I thought you might have known. They have been legislated&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>he is referring to tax cuts&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">they are not just promises, they are law, l-a-w law.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>He said that on 9 February 1993. Despite the fact that these so&hyphen;called tax cuts were legislated, that promise was broken by the Australian Labor Party. Keating in 1992 said, `What I am promising is not to put up tax'&mdash;and then he proceeded, following the election, to do so. In the interview with John Shovelan in August of 1993 the Leader of the Australian Democrats said that it does not matter whether promises are kept and that she did not really hear the then Prime Minister say that he was going to reduce taxation&mdash;that he had legislated for tax cuts and would not be putting up taxation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have two parties led by groups who think that the Australian people will accept that sort of easy statement, that sort of comment, that it does not matter what the commitment is; it is really only in the perception of the Australian Democrats or the Australian Labor Party that a result matters. The Australian people have rejected that approach to the whole process. They have rejected the idea that one should make promises that one does not expect to keep and they expect politicians to keep their promises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind the House of some of the pre&hyphen;election promises of the coalition parties, because in our policy on security for older <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australians there was a commitment on the very first page to extending the pension tax rebate to self&hyphen;funded retirees with incomes which are equivalent to those of pensioners who are eligible for the rebate. That is a promise that was kept in the first budget, and it was a most significant promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was also a promise to reduce the provisional tax uplift factor from eight per cent to six per cent and a promise to provide capital gains tax relief for Australians who sell their business to provide for retirement. They are also commitments that have been met in the budget. Point after point of the election policy of the then opposition, the Liberal and National parties, has been delivered. Their election policy for security for older Australians has been kept.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the coalition policies on provision of certainty for families there was a commitment that families with annual incomes of up to $70,000 would receive a $1,000 per year increase in their tax free threshold for each dependent child. There is a clear enunciation of a policy of relief for families which would provide assistance to families with children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition policies document includes provisions for capital gains tax relief, health concessions for families with children and provisions for changes to support for youth employment opportunities. Commitments are made regarding marriage preparation and pre&hyphen;marriage education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainties for families have been delivered at the first opportunity by the coalition government. A promised program of traineeships, especially for apprentices, was referred to, prior to the election, as the prospect of modern new apprentices and the opportunity of getting more people into real work and real job training. This commitment was delivered in the first budget of the coalition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is sad to reflect that that once great party, the Australian Labor Party, and the previous Prime Minister promised prior to the election not to put up taxes and then proceeded to put up taxes. I would like to enunciate for the House some of the taxes that you put up when you were in government. In 1993 you increased wholesale sales taxes by two per <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3768"> cent from 20 per cent to 22 per cent. You broke that promise not to put up taxes. The commitment that we made during that election campaign was that if you promised not to put up taxes we would hold you to that promise. In the 1993 campaign we made the commitment that if you broke your promise we would vote against those measures in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unlike the current opposition, we made our commitment during the election campaign as to what we would do and we expected the Australian Labor Party to stick by their commitments. They broke their commitments and were then rejected in 1996 by the Australian electorate. In the meantime the Labor Party has said, `We did not agree to any of the matters that the coalition put forward as policies for the last election and so we reserve the right to vote against the budget at any opportunity given us by the true leader of the Australian Labor Party, Senator Cheryl Kernot.' She is the effective leader of the ALP; she is the one that is calling the shots on what you will vote against and you just follow along and pick up any little crumb she cares to drop because you know that without her, without her leading the Australian Labor Party, you stand no chance in the Senate to win a vote.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SD4">Mr CADMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) for admitting to the mistakes and tragic decisions taken by the Australian Labor Party. I am pleased that you have admitted them now here in the House. It is a tragedy that  promises were made to not increase taxes and yet the Australian <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Labor Party, led by Paul Keating, broke promise after promise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have already enunciated one&mdash;wholesale sales tax. They said they would not increase taxes, but up went wholesale sales tax. They increased petrol tax by 7c; they increased excise on tobacco; they taxed as normal income lump sum payments for unused annual leave and long service leave; and they imposed the fringe benefits tax on salary package benefits. Tax after tax after tax went onto the Australian people in 1993-94, more taxes in 1994-95 and more again in 1995-96. So this party, the Australian Labor Party&mdash;the great supporter of the working class, so they say&mdash;despite making promises to the Australian people that they would not increase taxes, proceeded to do so in three successive budgets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unlike the opposition, we went to the Australian people with a commitment to get the deficit fixed, not to increase taxes, and at the same time to provide certain benefits for sections of the Australian community which were punished and victimised by the Australian Labor Party. Those sections of the community that were punished and victimised by the Australian Labor Party were mainly the elderly people of Australia, the families of Australia with children and the small businesses of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At last the Australian people became absolutely sick and tired of Paul Keating and his mob in the Australian Labor Party. They got sick and tired of Keating saying, `It is fixed. We're not going to put up taxes. Believe me, everything is right.' They voted them out of office in huge numbers. Now that same Australian Labor Party that broke promise after promise during its 1993 election campaign is saying, `We have a right to force this current government to break its promises by voting against measures that were committed to by the coalition prior to the last election.' I think that is the height of hypocrisy. Every member of the Australian Labor Party stands condemned, because not only did they fail to keep their own promises but they want to force others to break their promises as well. How hypocritical!</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3769">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that, no matter where people come from in this great nation, whether it be from the Penrith area and the great Nepean Valley or from Parramatta and those great areas of ethnic diversity around Parramatta, they understood at the last election the importance of policies for families, the importance of policies for small business and the importance of looking after our retirees and the elderly of Australia. They realised the significance of any incoming government keeping its promises. That is something the coalition government has done: it has stuck to its promises in the first budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have noticed that present in the chamber this evening are representatives from areas such as the Hawkesbury region down to Goulburn and the beautiful tablelands of central New South Wales&mdash;people who have wanted a government to come into office that would stick to its promises and deliver on its promises. Not only has this government delivered on its promises but also it has been able to mop up some of the mess that was made by the previous administration by plugging a deficit of $7.2 billion. That is an achievement that few could match.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to reiterate to the House that this budget is a fair budget. It is a strong budget. It sticks with the commitments made during the election campaign. It sticks with the commitments made to the families of Australia and it sticks to those commitments right in line with the policies that we announced prior to the election. The budget dealt with the Labor Party's deficit and it will help to reduce interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But you guys over on the other side of the House&mdash;in this new atmosphere of irrelevancy where nobody wants to take notice of you or to talk to you&mdash;seem to want to continue with a policy of high interest rates and unemployment. Let me tell you that the Australian people have had enough of that. They are not going to listen to that sort of rubbish. If any party in Australia thinks it has a right to rule, it is the Australian Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The very attitudes and arrogance of the Australian Labor Party are epitomised by the shadow Treasurer and opposition members in the House tonight, Mr Deputy Speaker <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Adams. But I am not reflecting on the chair because I know you are not like that at all. But other members on your side of the House are in fact like that because they have a born-to-rule attitude. It is a right that they assume is theirs. `Nothing is too good for the Australian worker or his representative' is their motto, and they repeat it time and time again. They act as if every right is theirs to rule and those who are poorly paid must obey.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what do the opposition want to do to Australia? They want to increase the deficit; they want to increase interest rates. It is a policy of knocking and whingeing. One only has to look at Gareth Evans, the shadow Treasurer, to understand that whingeing and knocking is the theme that the whole Australian Labor Party understands very well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Constructive policies to improve the lot of Australians is something that they do not understand. I am delighted to endorse this budget and the decisions made by the coalition government because they are going to build a strength, an opportunity, a hope and a promise for the families and the small businesses of Australia.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no such thing in this modern world as keeping pace. You have two choices: you either move forward or you fall behind. As a result of this budget one thing is certain: we will fall prey to other nations in our region where there is still a cooperative and dynamic relationship between government, industry, labour and community organisations. Until this government was elected, we were unquestionably going forward. That is not my opinion; it is an opinion confirmed by objective economic statistics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The May national accounts figures showed that Australia's growth was running at 4.8 per cent, not for one month but for the 12-month period prior to May of this year. On 30 May 1996, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS> said, `Australia's economy has recorded a spectacular growth surge'&mdash;a surge over 12 months on top of four previous years. Also on that day the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> said, `The Australian economy is now growing at twice the rate of other industrialised economies.'</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3770">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you want to disregard those commentators, you cannot possibly ignore the following words of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), which were noted by the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham):</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The incoming Government inherited an Australian economy . . . that was a little better than just good in parts . . . We have had 19 quarters of positive economic growth . . . low levels of inflation, and we continue to enjoy the benefits of the very close geographic proximity to the fastest growing economic region in the world.</PARA>
<PARA>Further proof that Labor left the economy in excellent shape is the interest rate cut of 0.5 per cent announced on 31 July 1996, even before this draconian budget. Labor's legacy was low inflation, moderate wage growth, a current account deficit which was manageable and falling, together with falling interest rates&mdash;all achieved with an economy which was achieving on objective analysis spectacular growth and leading the OECD countries and, indeed, twice that of other industrialised economies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One aspect of our economy which was unsatisfactory, however, was the extent of unemployment. As with most industrialised countries, the unemployment rate was unacceptably high. It followed the most rapid period of technological change industry has ever seen&mdash;not just since the turn of this century but which industry has ever seen. That is where this budget is going to cause suffering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been in this House now on several occasions when the Prime Minister has been asked to specify what the government's target on reducing unemployment is. When you are talking about reducing unemployment, you are talking about reducing human misery. He has no such target, and that was confirmed this very day in question time. Labor, on the other hand, had a target to reduce unemployment to at least five per cent by the year 2000. With the economic growth figures as they were, we were well on target to produce that result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So whatever is said here today in this debate on the Appropriation Bill and despite the cowardice in not setting a target for reducing unemployment, this government is going to be judged against the Labor Party's target, which would have been achieved, of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> five per cent unemployment by the year 2000. That is how it will be judged, that is how it should be judged and that is where it will fail and be thrown out of office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By crushing the spirit of the economy, as this budget does, the government is going to cause great human suffering and underutilisation of this nation's greatest resource&mdash;its people. Australians want a government. If they were obsessed by having economic fundamentalists determine their lives, they would go and engage a firm of chartered accountants. Even reputable firms, whether they be Ernst and Young or Peat Marwick, would not be as obsessed as this fanatical government is with its own propaganda and ideology. Those respectable firms of accountants would appreciate that, in advising a prosperous company, that company would need to invest in and develop its resource base and its infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's own published budget overview and economic outlook predictions published on page 2 of the budget overview summary showed the underlying budget balance returning to zero over the next few years without displacing the economic momentum which was developing, without displacing the job creation strategies and programs put in place by the Labor government and without causing the unjustified hardship that many Australians will suffer as a result of this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you are in a debate you know that the other side is in real trouble when they retreat to rhetoric. It is a sure sign that they lack vision, it is a sure sign that they lack balance, it is a sure sign that they lack reason; but that is the mode of operation of this government. It is a government based on rhetoric.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As was predicted by an economic commentator in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 2 May 1996, the government was building its plans on the foundation of the supposed black hole. It was described as the front&hyphen;line ideological bludgeon of the government. The commentator quite correctly stated: `Repeat any proposition often enough and loudly enough and it becomes the received truth.'</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3771">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a clear aim of the new federal government to convince Australians that there is an $8 billion hole in the Commonwealth budget. Of course, repetition has been the strategy of propaganda since recorded time. I did a quick search of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> reports as to the number of times that government members have repeated this hollow catchcry of `black hole', and it was astounding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister admitted that the government achieved a score of only about seven out of 10 in complying with its election commitments. If the Prime Minister in his former capacity as a solicitor were only seven&hyphen;tenths forthright in his professional dealings, he would have been struck off. It is effectively saying that during the last election campaign the Australian people were conned almost a third of the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The nation is not a balance sheet; it is a nation of people. We all have a common interest in the welfare and the advancement of each other. Any civilised country is judged according to how it treats its elderly, how it treats its children and how it treats its disadvantaged. This government fails on all counts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister said on 20 April this year, `The one group in the community that is not going to be hurt is the most vulnerable.' When we look at the facts, frail older people who need nursing home care will pay twice&mdash;in up-front fees and in means testing of nursing home fees. The combination of the nursing home fees and the pension income tests means that many people will pay at least 75c of every dollar they earn in lost pension and nursing home fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition also promised to maintain all Commonwealth concessions. Yet, since the budget, concession cards are now worth three&hyphen;quarters of a billion dollars less. Four million concession card holders will have to pay an extra 50c for each prescription, and they will have to pay at least $26 more each year before their prescriptions are free.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps the cruelest blow of all is demonstrated by this government's action in cutting out assistance for dental care. In my electorate, more than 10,000 people will no longer have access to free dental treatment. If they have a chronic toothache, or a tooth which <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> can be saved, they will have to wait. By the time they get care, they will probably have to have that tooth removed. Once that tooth is removed, they may well have to go to a job interview. Mr Deputy Speaker, you and I know what prospects they will have of obtaining employment when they go to a job interview missing a front tooth. That does not matter, however, because they are part of a substratum that falls on the negative side of a balance sheet. They can be discarded according to this government and they have been discarded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Older people using the home and community care program services will pay more; for example, people receiving meals on wheels and people receiving home nursing assistance. The carers of these people, who are receiving home respite care, will also be affected. A massive amount of assistance to these people has been taken out of the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a television interview the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) quite rightly said that no&hyphen;one would be forced to sell their home in order to move into a nursing home. That is true if you want to move into a substandard nursing home. If two people apply to a successful, reputable, competent nursing home but only one of those people can afford an up-front fee, which person is the nursing home going to choose? The answer is obvious. The people who do not have the up-front fee are going to be prejudiced. That is particularly so when both partners are alive. If one partner becomes disabled, the other will have to find the means to obtain the up&hyphen;front fee or put their partner into a substandard nursing home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Probably all honourable members in this place have been into those substandard nursing homes during election periods to collect postal votes and the like. They are soul destroying places. If you had your facilities when you went into such a nursing home, you would lose them within weeks. That is going to be the tragedy befalling many, many families. The other alternative is to borrow money to meet that up&hyphen;front fee, in which case the debt&mdash;which is a debt imposed on the entire family&mdash;is going to amount to nothing less than a death tax.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3772">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other important aspect of this budget is what it has done to children. Before the last election the Prime Minister described how he was committed to maintaining a non-means tested child-care cash rebate and said that he would maintain the system of child-care assistance. But child-care fees are about to go up by half a billion dollars, thanks to the Prime Minister's so-called family budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The child-care cash rebate has been cut by $34.7 million, and the operational subsidies for community based long day care centres have been abolished, producing government cuts of about $108 million. These are amounts which have to be made up by the users of these facilities. It is going to mean about an extra $25 a week for a child under three and about an extra $14 a week for a child over three. An average wage earner with one child receives perhaps an additional $400 as a result of the taxation threshold being raised. That compares with an additional child&hyphen;care impost of about $1,500 net or $3,000 gross per year. There is no comparison. There is no doubt that the Australian people have been conned by the Prime Minister, both before the election and in the delivery of this policy. No matter what we say here today, they will find that out and he will be judged accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of this budget, the extra long day care places which were to become available between now and the year 2000 will not go ahead, making it even more difficult to get good quality affordable care. A constituent recently contacted me and described the hardship which the family was going to face as a result of having to either increase the amount of their contribution to the child-care centre where their child is supported and feels comfortable or take the child away. In the United States a situation known as `child warehousing' has developed, where parents literally open the front door of the child-care centre and push their children inside. The children receive no stimulation. What happens to the children is more a matter of luck than of competent management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minority groups which are going to suffer as a result of the removal of assistance to community day care centres include children with disabilities, children of migrant <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> families and children who need additional literacy skills. With a bit of assistance and encouragement, those children would go on to become upstanding and productive members of our society. The tragedy is that those children are now going to remain disadvantaged for all of their lives as a result of what this government has done in its budget. It is not simply a question of bleeding hearts. It is a question of our future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The conservative philosophy is based on encouraging so-called free enterprises and encouraging profits in the belief that economic development will flow down to the more needy elements of society. When judging what the government has done in terms of the aged, children and the disabled we find that it falls short. A classic example is the reduction in research and development tax concession which was previously allowed to Australian industry at the rate of 150 per cent. We are comparing ourselves with Singapore and Malaysia which currently have an allowance of 200 per cent. This government has taken 25 per cent off that 150 per cent. If we were talking about a rugby union team we would be talking about taking the two breakaways off the field and telling the lock forward that he can play only half a game.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you compare Australia with those other teams&mdash;Singapore and Malaysia&mdash;you find that they are allowing a rebate of 200 per cent, confirmed in the government's own budget papers. They have effectively put in another back line&mdash;another five places on their team. New Zealand has foolishly reduced its rebate for research and development to 100 per cent and we have seen what has happened there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are playing in a global competition and you take 2&half; players off the field and the other side puts five extra players on the field, who is going to win? They are going to win. Australia is going to lose. What does it mean in terms of Australian jobs? They will not be there. We will return to the old days of the 1950s where we were pulling out minerals and exploiting our agricultural raw materials but not value adding because we were not engaged in sufficient research and development to promote those resources. Independent <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3773"> studies have shown that, with the previous research and development allowances, by the year 2010 we were headed for earning an extra $60 billion a year in exports. That surely must now be questioned because we are not investing in our own infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should look at what the government has done in terms of assistance for the manufacturing industry. We are talking here about taking money away from the textile, clothing and footwear, shipbuilding, printing, information and technology, automotive and engineering, pharmaceutical and food industries. All these industries were moving beyond the embryonic stage and starting to get into some real and meaty export activity. Those industries are very much threatened as a result of this government's budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government talks about the sanctity of the small business sector. A great proportion of the small business sector is tied to those very industries I have mentioned. They are going to be handicapped. Their ability to employ people and promote Australia is going to be all but snuffed out in a very short time by this ideologically driven budget. The black hole has nothing to do with it. It is an ideology which the Prime Minister has had for at least 10 years. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

On all of these fronts this budget has been well received.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Griffith University is the 14th largest university in this country and it is at the centre of my electorate. It has received the second highest funding boost of any tertiary institution in the land. They will receive a 5.2 per cent increase in operational grants for 1996-97 and a 7.9 per cent increase for 1997&hyphen;98.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This means all the major capital works programs which were sorely needed to relieve the pressure on the Nathan Campus in particular are going to be delivered. A new campus at Logan is going to be built. This confirms the Howard government most definitely sees Griffith University as having a reputation as a quality provider of higher education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I graduated from there so obviously I am very pleased to see the government giving Griffith this particular mantle. It disappoints me to note the student representative council of that university is dominated by those of the left who make members of the Labor Party look like fascists. This student representative council went straight down the rhetorical path offered by those opposite suggesting the budget alienated students voters&mdash;some 600,000 of them. They said they were appalled with this budget. They said it was one of the most regressive budgets ever released for education in Australian history. They decided to ignore some of the real facts behind it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those sorts of reasons, I am delighted to note the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS> gave a deal of credit to a fine letter written by an 18&hyphen;year&hyphen;old in my electorate. It has been the letter of the week in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier Mail</EMPHASIS> over the last couple of weeks. I have never met Vance Flesser of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3774"> Eight Mile Plains, but I would certainly like to shake his hand. It is worth reading parts of his letter into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. Vance writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am an 18&hyphen;year&hyphen;old student in my first year of university. It disappoints me to see such hype and anger surrounding the planned increases in HECS fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In any business, if there are money problems, an increase in revenue or a decrease in expenditure is imminent. So, why, when it comes to the viability of the country, do we think more of ourselves than the big picture?</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I thought that one day I might become a politician so I could help people. I'm sure that was and still is the intention of senior politicians. People think that John Howard and Amanda Vanstone are deliberately doing bad to the community. Do they think they are dumb and don't have a clue about life?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Generally, I don't think people realise the intelligence of our senior politicians; they would rather whinge than look optimistically at changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I look at HECS as an investment in my future. Without a university degree, it would be much more difficult to achieve my financial aims. If I end up having to pay back $10,000 extra, I still think it will be a small price for an education in a country that has a future.</PARA>
<PARA>Vance continues to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">My parents are far from rich; I have two jobs and I run my own small business so I can survive through university. While I have a busy and difficult life, I can see the light at the end of the tunnel: one day it will pay off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Maybe we should start looking optimistically about where we are headed as a country and place more trust in our politicians.</PARA>
<PARA>I can say that Vance Flesser obviously has a greater deal of perspicacity than the collected wisdom of those opposite. His letter of the week award from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS>  is a rich reward because the facts are pretty simple: with regard to HECS, it covers only roughly 27 per cent of the total cost of education. We can compare that with other countries like Denmark where 40 per cent of course costs are contributed by students, the United States where the figure is about 50 per cent and Japan where the figure rises to around 60 per cent&mdash;countries that are all economically doing extremely well and students more than happily pay their way. With regard to the amount it costs, the rebate threshold has been lowered to $20,701. At that level, roughly <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> $21,000 per year, the cost of HECS works out at a movie ticket a week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us consider the plight of people like Arthur Potter, somebody who traditionally voted for the Labor Party but, like so many other people, turned his back on them at the last election. He is a confirmed trade unionist so that is another reason he would have done that&mdash;a man of 36, my age, on $24,000 a year, with two children, like me, whose wife chooses to stay at home, like mine. He is in the minority of Australian families because almost two&hyphen;thirds of Australian families have come to rely on two incomes. Yet Arthur Potter is a person who on $24,000 a year is able to do all this with such an amount of money. On something like $3,000 less, we are asking predominantly single university students, providing they start a job, to start repaying their HECS bill&mdash;and this seems fair enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It amazed me to see the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) in Queensland recently visiting one of the university campuses in Brisbane. It seems to me the Leader of the Opposition does not go anywhere without the SS when he comes to Queensland, the SS being Swan and Sciacca, two former members of this place. When he is up there on what seems the odd occasion, he is madly trying to support B1 and B2, the remaining Labor members from Queensland&mdash;the member for Brisbane and the member for Rankin, Bevis and Beddall&mdash;B1 and B2 we call them in Queensland.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I certainly shall&mdash;I have and I will. Despite what the Labor Party are attempting to get up as the issues out of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3775"> this budget, many people have told me they happily accept the need for the tough decisions which have been made by this government. They are also pleased the burden has been spread fairly across the community. People tell me they are willing to give this Howard government a chance to manage the economy and to make the changes which they voted for, changes which are necessary. It is painfully clear to so many people just how badly the previous government both misled and failed them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This feedback has not just come from calls and letters to my office or from simply reading my local newspapers. Following the budget, I went out and asked people in a very wide berth across my electorate. On the Saturday morning following the Tuesday night budget I set up information booths in various shopping centres across the electorate to reach the broadest possible cross&hyphen;section of our local community. That feedback was certainly extremely positive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People in the electorate of Moreton have told me they understand that instead of having to borrow to finance government expenditure, as we have been doing ever increasingly over the past two decades, we as a country have to live within our means. That is what a lot of Australians aspire to in their own homes so they understand why governments should be aspiring to the same thing. To put it in the words of one chap I met at Moorooka, `Everyone knows you can't milk a dry cow.' I guess that means everyone except for the Labor Party&mdash;and I am not sure exactly what it is the Democrats believe this particular hour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget has set up the necessary building blocks for economic and social recovery. I am confident that over the next four years the forecasts by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) of the government's books being returned into balance and then into surplus will be realised. The books will take on a pre&hyphen;Whitlam era shape. It is amazing to see that government yet again being the measure of failure in this country. We will see a return to a period where government is not borrowing to pay for basic services and we as a country will again live within our means while, of course, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ensuring priority is given to those in the most need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another avenue of feedback has been the response to basic information which I faxed out on budget night to various stakeholders in my local community, people as diverse as ordinary family people, training providers and people in the small business sector on whom I am relying to provide the real lead as far as the generation of real jobs is concerned. All these people are very optimistic that the budget measures are going to produce some real benefits in the medium term while, at the same time, returning the budget to surplus before the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Importantly, they feel that not only has the government listened to their views but also it has taken them on board, putting their views into action&mdash;putting together the one&hyphen;stop shop to combine the activities of social security and the CES under one roof. People have never been able to understand why they have to traipse from one part of town to another to try to get some of the basic government services they need, especially when their money is tight and they are unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An example is the Brisbane South Community Group, a marvellous non&hyphen;profit community based organisation in my electorate. They have an organisation office at Annerley and now also at Mount Gravatt which is in my electorate. It works with the help of local churches, service groups and volunteers in the area of training and job placements. They run a very sharp and professional operation. They are geared up, ready to take on the various challenges which have been put forward by the changes introduced under this budget in the area of employment training. They say these new measures alone will be a great relief to unemployed people because so many people spend their time and money trailing around after various government offices, doing government's bidding rather than getting on with the business of generating their own jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know that under Labor Australia suffered the worst recession in 60 years; more than one million Australians were out of work. But Labor's grand solution, Working <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3776"> Nation, proved to be nothing more than a grand failure and a great waste of money in so many ways.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The facts are simple. We know two&hyphen;thirds of the long&hyphen;term unemployed&mdash;put through Labor's Working Nation employment program supposedly to help them gain real jobs&mdash;are still unemployed. This is a shocking indictment. It is a sad thing the member for Hotham has left the chamber because those sorts of facts are his legacy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A couple of months ago I agreed to a couple of final year Griffith University students undertaking an internship through my office as part of their degree. I asked them to assess how labour market programs were working in my electorate. They put a lot of work into it&mdash;talking to unemployed people, to those providing training, to those who wanted to get on with the job of providing real jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did not realise at the time it was going to turn out to be such an extremely difficult assignment for them. Despite their very best efforts, all they have been able to find out is that no specific data exists to tell us what the real outcomes were under Labor's Working Nation program. Those opposite keep talking about targets but their target is missing. Therefore they cannot vouch for what they say they achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people who remain unemployed, dishevelled and disoriented&mdash;because they were picked up for six months, taken off the unemployment list, hidden and then dropped back down a deeper hole&mdash;know the truth. That is why they voted the Labor Party out of power on 2 March.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People want jobs&mdash;they want the jobs which Working Nation was supposed to deliver but did not. The program changes introduced under this budget are the way to go. The truth is the people who participated in the Working Nation program ended up back on the dole queue and they are looking for a change; they are looking for the leadership this government has created.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Working Nation proved to be the cruellest hoax of all. Labor knew there would be no jobs at the end of the line but it suited them <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to hide the true unemployment statistics behind training programs. It certainly amazes me to hear the Leader of the Opposition say he is opposed to the one&hyphen;stop shop initiative for the Department of Social Security and the CES introduced under this budget. Whose side is he on? Who does he think his party is supposed to represent? I do not think he knows.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is patently obvious to Australians that the Leader of the Opposition is not on the side of the battler. He does not want to help them get onto the pathway to real jobs; he just wants to keep them running around in circles. He is offering doom and gloom with no end in sight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let's face it: the announcement that Labor will be opposing over $7 billion in budget measures will have an effect on interest rates, driving them up. Labor has been swinging the wrecking ball on the economy for 13 years. Now it wants another three years in which to play around and fiddle with it, hurting people in the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The thing the people opposite have forgotten is that they lost the election. The demolition derby was called off by the Australian people on 2 March. It is time for them to take a cold shower, find themselves and then, maybe, work their way out of the wilderness. This government is stopping Labor's un&hyphen;merry&hyphen;go&hyphen;round. That is what this budget is all about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another of our one&hyphen;stop shop measures, which has been enthusiastically welcomed by training providers and businesses alike in my electorate, is the employment placement enterprises, EPEs. These EPEs will combine the three strands of career planning, training and placement. Once this initiative is up and running it will produce effective linkages not only for people currently unemployed but also between the classroom and the workplace to give our young people a real opportunity to obtain satisfying and rewarding employment once they leave school.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">EPEs are about real networking between people&mdash;between education and training providers and business&mdash;to produce real results for people. Those are things the previous government just talked about. This is the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3777"> difference between the employment policies of the Howard&hyphen;Fischer government and the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I was elected in March I made it one of my priorities to contact my local chambers of commerce. I have been dealing with them for some years. The chambers of commerce in my area really have their act together. The South West chamber with Peter Janssen and the Southside chamber with Geoff Curtis are very effective groups and they are giving me the straight drum, the straight feedback on what small business wants. The key priority of business in my electorate&mdash;this might be of interest to those opposite&mdash;is expanding their businesses and creating real jobs. That is what it is all about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have formed with these very good people an advisory group so I can get the straight drum and then air their views in this place and through departmental and ministerial channels. I also want to link them with training providers to match people with jobs. They are very receptive to the idea. Consequently, the Moreton Small Business Advisory Committee, as it is called, is making a real contribution towards helping this government remove Labor's stumbling blocks to a real, sustainable recovery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know so many of the signposts offered by this budget are just directions which need to be followed by those in the broader community. So much of the work is in the hands of small business owners. The government has set out to encourage a small business&hyphen;led recovery, a real, sustainable recovery with this budget. We want to see small business grow and hire more people because I firmly believe it is small business growth which will provide the real jobs we are all needing and for which people have been waiting 13 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of my electorate alone&mdash;this is a simple analogy but it is worth putting again&mdash;there are 6,500 small businesses operating, with more than 9,000 or 10,000 in and around the general area. If they all hired one more person each there would be no local unemployment; we would have to import people from other areas of Australia.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moreton is all ready to go. One message, though, which I am getting very clearly from my electorate is that small business, while they have noticed an upswing in the last couple of weeks since the budget, will remain hesitant until they see the unfair dismissal legislation go through. Unless they see that move, unless the Senate gets around to passing the bills currently before it, small business cannot kick in and gain the confidence needed to get on with the job of not only staying in business but also building business and hiring more people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government simply must not rest on the laurels extended to it over this budget. While the news is very good out of my electorate&mdash;the signposts are there and people can read them; they are easy to understand&mdash;it seems to me and to so many others in my electorate there is so much to be done. But, from everything I am seeing and hearing in my electorate, the people of Moreton are certainly leading the way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will be putting more work into dealing with my local small business community to effect a sustainable small business led recovery so everyone can benefit. If our national economy keeps growing&mdash;and it has to start at each of the local levels: the mums and dads and the individuals who risk a lot to start a small business and keep it going&mdash;small business must be given a fair go. Small business growth is certainly something which will come as a result of this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very confident the small business advisory group established in Moreton, with the help of people like Geoff Curtis, Peter Janssen, John Patterson, David Peel, Charlie Henry, Geoff Wilson and other interested people who are queuing up to lend a hand, will get the right feedback into the ears of the ministers and the senior people in this government. We will get realistic feedback about how the government's plans and policies put forward in the budget are performing, and we will make sure real jobs are generated. This is the key message which has come out of this budget. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A well-known Australian said, `The public good is not measured in dollars and cents; it is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3778"> measured in trust.' Having witnessed the Treasurer (Mr Costello) present his budget two weeks ago, perhaps the most savage budget to be presented before a federal parliament since Federation, these words have never been more worth remembering. I repeat for the benefit of those opposite who may not have heard, `The public good is not measured in dollars and cents; it is measured in trust.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Which famous Australian can we thank for those fine words? Well, before I tell the House I think it is important that the parliament and especially those members opposite understand to what extent this budget actually attacks the public good and betrays the trust shown to this government by the Australian people on 2 March. I think it is necessary also that we all have a picture of how the government, in the process of forming its budget, has weighed the needs of the Australian people against its ideologically tainted ledger book and has found the Australian public wanting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is essential we recognise that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), who publicly yearns for a time when Australia was supposedly a much simpler and fairer nation, is in fact intent on condemning this country to a future where equity is found within the folds of one's wallet and where fairness will be a quaint concept learnt by our children from the pages of history books.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is essential we realise that Australia has for its Prime Minister a man who, although responsible for a budget which breaks promise after promise of his election commitments, said, `I make it clear, I'm not going to break any promises.' And, when asked whether he would resign if any of his promises were broken, he said, `Promises I make, I keep.' It is important that we realise that this is the man who, although giving his approval for the most dishonest of budgets, once said, `I am desperate to be a very honest man.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> I want to get this all clear. I think it is necessary, I think it is essential, that we all understand these things, that we get it clear in our heads before I reveal the author of the statement with which I began my speech: `The public good is not measured in dollars and cents; it is measured in trust.' It is im portant I bring this all out before the House because it just shows how little the author actually believed in what he said. It shows just how ready the author is to immerse himself in political hypocrisy. It explains for us the cynicism that Australians hold towards their political leaders, a cynicism which is fast becoming insurmountable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The author is of course none other than our own Prime Minister, the Hon. John Howard, the member for Bennelong. In approving this budget, the Prime Minister has betrayed his word&mdash;whether he ever meant to keep it or not. He has indeed measured the public good in dollars and cents and in so doing has broken the `covenant of trust' he purportedly holds so dear to his heart.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I stand here tonight not shocked, not feigning moral outrage but empty with disappointment in a Prime Minister who was ushered into power on 2 March largely via a campaign aimed at winning the trust of the Australian people. This budget before the House breaks that trust. I am saddened that we have as a leader a man with none of the moral fibre, none of the integrity and none of the principles he has tried so hard to convince the people of Australia he enjoys. And in the end I am saddened by what his betrayal will ultimately cost this country. For me and the people I represent, it is a disappointment&mdash;a sickening disappointment&mdash;to find that your own Prime Minister thinks nothing of not only betraying his word but selling his fellow Australians down the river with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people of Prospect, indeed of all Australia, have a right to be shocked and angry at what this budget means for them. For my constituents, 120,000 of us living in Sydney's south-west, this budget comes after months of cutbacks and closures, which have given us a taste of what was to come. But that was just the softening up process. This budget will now begin to really turn the screws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prospect is an electorate blighted by one of the highest rates of unemployment in Australia. Unemployment is at the root of the worst social evils attacking my community&mdash;drug abuse, family dislocation and juvenile delinquency. The people of Prospect, employed <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3779"> and unemployed alike, need a government which believes in providing solutions to the problems of unemployment. This budget contains no such solutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As part of the government's pre-budget campaign of cuts, it announced the closure of a highly successful CES office in my area. The justification given by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone)&mdash;on my office answering service, I might add&mdash;was that the Wetherill Park CES specialised in providing service to employers. Through her twisted logic, the minister concluded that, because Wetherill Park CES, centred in the largest industrial centre in Australia and enjoying the complete support of the local chambers of commerce, had a specialised employer focus, it somehow failed to serve the unemployed of my area and therefore warranted closure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You only have to look at the centre's results to realise how ridiculous this thinking is. After opening in July 1993, Wetherill Park CES redirected its focus and became an employer service centre&mdash;in the process more than doubling the amount of employers on its books, from 802 to 1,616. It received notification of some 7,066 job vacancies from businesses in the area, of which it filled 5,363. It placed 2,130 job seekers through its own matching and referral activities, and it facilitated 1,495 program commencements in the area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A recent report on Wetherill Park CES prepared for Fairfield City Council and unanimously approved by the council's Business and Resource Committee, which includes a number of Liberal members, states that the centre was responsible for finding jobs for between 600 and 800 long-term unemployed residents who otherwise would not have found work. The report states that the Wetherill Park CES was responsible for reducing the unemployment rate in the Fairfield local government area by 0.5 and 0.9 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Based on these results, the Commonwealth has been saved millions of dollars per annum by forgoing unemployment benefits for the people that the Wetherill Park CES office has assisted. It has also gained through the PAYE <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tax payments from these people. Through the centre, over $5 million worth of subsidies were injected into the business community. Via its presence, local retail expenditure increased by approximately $1 million to $2 million. Sadly, these impressive results meant nothing to the minister and the government, and now the Wetherill Park CES office is no more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the cuts go deeper than one CES office closing down. Thousands of Prospect's long-term unemployed stand to be disadvantaged by the government's budget decision to cut funding to such successful labour market programs as skillshare and the new enterprise incentive scheme. The government will provide enough funding between October and the end of June next year for four skillshare centres in my electorate to look after 570 clients. One of these centres alone catered for 760 clients in the last financial year. Between them they handled over 2,000 people. Obviously the funding allocated by the government will not be enough and three of the four centres will now be forced to close.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new enterprise incentive scheme, a hugely successful program in anyone's language, will be gutted in my electorate of Prospect. Centres that were previously funded to offer over 100 clients positions in the NEIS programs will now offer 50. Some centres will offer none at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what do the unemployed of Prospect do? What shall they do with their time? Sit happily on their hands while the Prime Minister and his Treasurer talk about how the budget cuts will give the unemployed the chance of a real job some time in the future? Should they click their heels at the prospect of spending months looking for work while being harassed by dole diaries and Senator Newman's `dob in a dole cheat' hotline, with no training opportunities and no chance of improving themselves or learning new skills?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister and the Treasurer have washed their hands of the people in Sydney's west. They want the unemployed of Fairfield and Greystanes, of Villawood and Carramar, of Bossley Park and Prairiewood to just wither on the vine, silently and out of sight. The Prime Minister's budget condemns his <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3780"> fellow Australians&mdash;our neighbours, friends, fathers, mothers, sons and daughters&mdash;to hopeless months of dole queues, with no respite, no chance and no future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Vanstone talks of labour market programs not giving value for money. What value does she place on human dignity? What value does she place on an individual's right to work? What value does she place on her Prime Minister's promises? `The public good,' he said, `is not measured in dollars and cents; it is measured in trust.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The worst of it all is that it makes no sense. Skillshare&mdash;according to those Liberal Party favourites, Access Economics&mdash;would improve this government's budgetary bottom line by over $80 million over the next three years based on current funding levels. Since 1986, NEIS has assisted over 10,000 Australians, with 84 per cent of those people in unsubsidised employment or training 15 months after starting their new enterprise incentive scheme businesses. On average, every 10 successful NEIS businesses employ a further five people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the people of Prospect can say goodbye to all of this now. As unemployment runs rampant through my community over the next three years, and as we become divided and dislocated by the crippling social problems which will surely follow, we will stand as a cruel reminder to the Prime Minister and his government of the one great truth concerning the labour market programs he despises so much: assisting the jobless is costly, but not assisting them is more so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Employment programs are not the only front on which Prospect and Sydney's west have been attacked by this budget. Higher education, child care, the elderly, the migrants and health care have all become targets. Thanks to the cuts in higher education funding, the children of Prospect will have less chance of finding a place at university after high school. The University of Western Sydney, the only university which directly serves Australia's most populous and fastest growing region, can currently offer only eight places per 1,000 people, against the Sydney&hyphen;wide average of 32 places per 1,000. Now that the University of Western Sydney will be <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> forced to cut 1,000 student places because of the cuts, the situation will deteriorate further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Robbing $500 million out of child-care funding nationally and pushing costs up by up to $20 per child per week will compel community based child-care centres in my electorate to seriously consider their future. An increase in child-care fees will provide an intolerable burden for the many families working in Prospect. Working parents will be forced to consider leaving the work force in order to stay at home to look after their children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The elderly of Prospect have been plunged into an atmosphere of fear and confusion over up&hyphen;front fees to nursing homes, which even the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) seems at a loss to explain. At the same time, they will pay more for their prescriptions and more for their home and community care services. If the elderly of my electorate have any problems with their teeth, they can join the two- to three-year waiting list which will now come again as a result of one of the budget's meanest cutbacks, the abolition of the Commonwealth dental health program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, as you know, my electorate is the most ethnically diverse in Australia. The migrants in my community stand to be hit doubly hard by this budget, and I am pleased that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) is in the House. After suffering the cuts to labour market programs, remembering unemployment among sections of the migrant community is around 40 per cent, migrants will bear the brunt of a whole raft of increased charges and cuts related to migrant services&mdash;worth $1 billion in total.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the Prime Minister had that little problem with his shoulder during the first great debate, it really was not a nervous twitch; he was just practising for this moment when he gets to shrug off all his government's responsibilities&mdash;shrug off the unemployed, shrug off the underprivileged, the elderly, the migrants, the young people: the list just goes on and on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister said last year that he wanted to live in a `nation based on hope'. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3781"> But this budget stamps out hope for the unemployed. The Prime Minister also said last year, `If the price of progress is human misery, it's not progress. If change makes people worse off, it's not reform.' As the cuts to the most underprivileged in our society show, this budget wallows in human misery. It is like a pig in mud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister said he wanted to govern for ordinary Australians and said, `Australian battlers will be better off with a change of government.' How can he cut labour market programs for the long-term unemployed and say that they are better off? How can the Prime Minister say one thing and then betray his word so ruthlessly? How can he have been so cavalier in his rhetoric? When did his promises splinter into core promises and non-core promises? When did he make such a distinction? He said, `The public good is not measured in dollars and cents; it is measured in trust.' And he accuses Labor of deceit!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister is not an empty vessel; he is an empty flagship. He is the pride of an empty fleet. The noise he makes will no longer be believed, nor will the noise of the government. The laughing hyenas on the other side cry out that none of this would have been necessary had Labor kept a more reasonable hand on the country's purse strings. By the Prime Minister's and Treasurer's own words, this argument now stands condemned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to the election, the Prime Minister made it clear on a number of occasions that the deficit, whatever its size, would be shouldered before a single one of his promises would be broken. Do government members remember that? Do they really remember it? It was in this context that he waxed lyrical about the public good not being measured in dollars and cents but being measured in trust.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it was not a line the Prime Minister was taking by himself. What did the Treasurer have to say on 1 March while on radio 3AW with Neil Maxwell? Neil Maxwell said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There's no chance that Peter Costello as Treasurer on Monday, or in the weeks after the election will say, `We've got the figures, they're so bad we can't afford what we promised.'</PARA>
<PARA>Peter Costello then answered:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No, because we've made it entirely clear that we will be delivering all of those matters that we've costed and put in the public domain.</PARA>
<PARA>There we have it. The argument that the Prime Minister is pushing, that he would like to fund all the promises he has made but that he cannot because of the state of the economy, was shot to pieces even before the election on 2 March. But if that is not enough, what did the Prime Minister have the good sense to say after the election? He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the incoming government inherited an Australian economy which I have to say was, and I say very positively, better than the curate's egg, better than just good in parts.</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister wants to blame Labor's handling of the economy for his ideologically driven spending cuts. What a foolish thing for him to say when all the time he and his government were planning to pass the evils of this budget on to Labor's supposed mismanagement of the economy. The Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the entire government benches have now been caught with curate's egg all over their faces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I have one thing to say to the Prime Minister&mdash;and it is something that will probably elicit a twinge of deja vu from the Treasurer. In this House on 5 May 1993, the now Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Opposition will not acquiesce in any of the breaking of the promises by the Prime Minister. Whatever be the rationale, whatever be the justification, whatever be the argument, whatever be the changed circumstances, whatever be the mirage, the mirrors, the obfuscation, the cloud, the argument that is put forward.</PARA>
<PARA>Let me say to the Treasurer, and to his supporters on the other side, that we in the Australian Labor Party think for once that you have hit the nail right on the head. We concur, for a change, with his statement 100 per cent. What is good for the goose is good for the gander, especially when the goose is as big as the federal Treasurer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prime Minister, you have made promises to the Australian people and you have broken them by bringing down this budget now before the House. It is as simple as that. No excuses&mdash;measured against the standards practised by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer in the past&mdash;will be accepted. I <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3782"> repeat, as I began my speech on this budget tonight, the words of the Prime Minister when he repeatedly said, `The public good is not measured in dollars and cents; it is measured in trust.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yes, the Prime Minister said it. The Prime Minister, I can only fear, must have been either cynical or pretending because when those words were stated he confirmed that that is what he meant. We have now seen a budget brought down that has betrayed the public trust, that has been measured in dollars and cents, that is all about cuts, that is all about the underprivileged suffering and that is all about hurting those who cannot stand up for themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a budget that will go down in history, as I said at the beginning of my speech, as one of the meanest budgets since Federation. What has been done through the selling of this budget&mdash;the hype and hypocrisy&mdash;is that people are going to finally see what the pages truly show. It is a budget that is not going to wash it away in one fell swoop; it is going to do it in a slow drip motion. Whichever way it does it, it is the people, the underprivileged, the elderly, the migrants, the people in need of child care, the people in need of skillshare programs who are going to suffer&mdash;and suffer they will continue to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe we need to see a lot more honesty when it comes to politicians saying during election campaigns what they will or will not do when they get into government. We see it continually happen. We have now seen, in a very short time, commitments and words that were freely given to the Australian electorate abolished in one fell swoop when this budget was brought down in this House on 20 August.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian people will not be fooled. The Australian people today are more questioning and have a higher standard when it comes to inquiring into how and why decisions are made. I believe that the public of Australia will see through the fickleness of this government and will also see what this budget means to them and to their families and friends. I condemn the way this budget has been brought down. I support the amendments that have been moved by the shadow <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Treasurer (Mr Gareth Evans) in the House tonight.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hold a different point of view from the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio). I would like to start by congratulating the Treasurer (Mr Costello) on bringing down what most Australian people, myself included, thought was a very sound, fair, balanced and certainly well received budget within the community. On top of that, I thought it was very cleverly crafted. That is a pleasant change for the coalition. I do not think we have sold ourselves as well in the past as perhaps the Labor Party has, and it looks like we have caught up and surpassed them even in that area too.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I get onto budget matters, I would like to take a short period to congratulate a certain girl in my electorate called Kristy Schaefer, a 15&hyphen;year&hyphen;old from Peak Hill, who the other day was crowned Miss Peak Hill Teenage Showgirl. You might think that is a pretty unremarkable event. It happens in country towns around Australia all the time. What made this particularly special was that she is an Aboriginal girl. She won from a very `hot' field of eight contestants and she won totally on merit. She won because she was exceptionally articulate, very attractive and has a wonderful attitude to life. One of her goals is to be a role model, as she grows up, for other Aboriginal people in the community so that they can lift themselves above the rut that some find themselves in. I found this very refreshing indeed. In fact, I rang the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Western </EMPHASIS> magazine which covers a very large area of my electorate and suggested they do a story on her because it is nice to have a good news story in the Aboriginal area for a change. Sue Harding, a journalist there, did just that and gave her a full page exposure. I think it is wonderful. As I say, I congratulate Kristy and her parents that have brought her up so well with the right attitudes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Getting onto the budget, the Treasurer had to bring down a budget in the particular context in which we find ourselves in this country today, namely: chronic unemployment stuck at an unacceptably high level between eight and nine per cent; and a record overseas debt that has ballooned out seven&hyphen; or eight&hyphen; <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3783">fold during the term of the previous government and now exceeds $180 billion. That alone puts a burden on the Australian community of $1,500 million a month going out in interest payments from Australia&mdash;something that we are suddenly handed and we have to fix.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have question marks over our sovereignty in this country. Overseas countries seem to be buying up so much of Australia because our economy has been in such trouble. On top of that, we were landed with this black hole of an extra $8 billion or $10 billion over and above what we were told it would be. Despite that, we have put in place a plan which the Australian people seem to have accepted readily and want to see implemented to give us a go. It is galling to see the stalling and the shenanigans going on in the Senate now, although one would expect the Australian Labor Party to oppose it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find as I move around from meeting to meeting with people in the electorate that there seems to be no more unpopular person in Australia than Senator Cheryl Kernot at the moment. People say, `When is this woman going to give it a break? She is on television every night pontificating about this and that'&mdash;and making herself incredibly unpopular with the basic Australian people. Whether you accept the budget or not, the Australian people gave the present government an overwhelming mandate to change the direction of this country and that will be thwarted in the Senate by a party that got a very low percentage of the vote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But think of the budget in these terms. It is the first budget I can ever remember where there has been: no increase in personal income tax; no increase in fringe benefits tax; no increase in capital gains tax; especially no increase in wholesale sales tax; no increase in fuel tax; and, even looking at it from the worker's point of view, no increase in beer tax or cigarette tax. All those taxes and not an increase in one of them!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Take fuel tax alone. The previous government used to put up fuel tax on a regular basis. I remember a recent budget&mdash;I think it was the 1993 one&mdash;where they tried to raise the fuel tax by 5c a litre on unleaded fuel and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 10c a litre on leaded fuel. Fortunately, we were able to wind that back. But an increase of one cent a litre on fuel rips another $300 million out of the community into government coffers and $100 million of that comes out of country areas. This is what they were doing with budget after budget after budget. What a refreshing change to have a Treasurer bring down a budget with not a cent increase in any of those taxes. I congratulate the Treasurer for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The centrepiece of the budget was the family tax initiative, which will put hundreds of millions of dollars back into the pockets of ordinary families. I welcome that and I leave that for other members to talk about. Also the private health insurance rebate was very welcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was particularly pleased to see the number of initiatives to small business delivering the promises that we made during the election campaign. And bringing down the provisional uplift tax factor from eight per cent to six per cent. It does not sound much but it is a drain on revenue of $180 million alone which will benefit small business. As I say, it is badly needed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there is the relief in capital gains tax where the first half a million dollars is free if you are upgrading your business into a like business or you are retiring. And also cutting the paperwork. Wonderful news for small business for the first time in over a decade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Isolated rural areas had a number of specific promises. I was pleased to see the fringe benefits tax eliminated on remote area housing. That is a cost to revenue of&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MF4">Mr COBB</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;An election promise at a cost to revenue of $20 million but delivered in full again&mdash;very welcome in the remote parts of my electorate. And assistance for isolated children allowances, increasing exactly as the Isolated Childrens Parents Association wanted. The correspondence allowance for primary school children doubles to $1,000 and is lifted by a similar amount for secondary school children. Also the non&hyphen;means tested boarding allowance is lifted to the 55 per cent level as they requested. A wonderful delivery. It did <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3784"> not cost the budget much but means so much for children out in those areas. So that was good too.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I would like to talk about some of the more contentious issues of the budget, and nursing homes is first on my agenda in that area. There has been a lot of scaremongering in this area, but look at the situation with nursing homes today in Australia. We have inherited a situation where, according to the Gregory report, there is a capital upgrading backlog of at least $600 million&hyphen;odd that needs to be spent on nursing homes to bring them up to speed. On top of that we have the most complex, incomprehensible classification system plaguing these homes which is driving them mad with paperwork. We have put in place a very reasonable scheme to address this problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The entry fee about which the present opposition are railing so much is no different. In fact, it is even milder than the very scheme that they themselves implemented back in 1988 for hostels&mdash;a scheme which we embraced and supported at the time, because we thought it had a lot of logic about it; a scheme which has worked successfully. In the 12 years that I have been a member, I have not had one complaint about hostel entry fees. That scheme has worked very well. About 65 per cent of the population is exempted from paying anything because they fall into the financially disadvantaged class; and the other 35 per cent who can afford to pay something or a larger amount are asked to contribute something. Essentially, that is the scheme we want to introduce into nursing homes to allow them to get a bit of working capital in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as entry fees go, no present nursing home residents will be asked to pay one cent more than they are paying now; and, as I say, we would expect about 65 per cent of future incoming residents&mdash;being on full pensions, et cetera&mdash;to be exempted from paying anything. But where the providers of the nursing homes want to strike a deal with incoming residents, as is done with hostels now, they can ask for a contribution from the incoming residents. The great bulk of that will be returned to the residents when they leave the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> nursing home or, if they pass on, will be returned to their estate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only $2,600 a year for a maximum of five years can be drawn down for the permanent use of the nursing home. The nursing home, of course, has the use of the interest on the investment&mdash;which will be put into a prudential account&mdash;of the remainder of the entry fee. So it is a very modest amount indeed. Only $13,000 maximum can be taken out permanently. However, the average length of term for a person in a nursing home is only 147 weeks&mdash;something less than three years&mdash;where you are going to ask for no contribution whatsoever for the first six months anyhow. So that means, in effect, the average amount permanently taken away from those 35 per cent or so who make a contribution will be something less than $6,500&mdash;a pretty minimal amount, I would have thought, and quite a reasonable thing to ask.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is sad to see the Labor Party running this scare campaign aimed at scaring the elderly. Quite frankly, I do not think it is a proper way to go, particularly when they, as I say, introduced entrance fees for hostels which we supported and which have worked very well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I particularly applaud the minister in this area for her proposals to revolutionise and diminish the paperwork associated with nursing home residents. It is driving the providers mad.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I spoke to one only the other day in one of the large towns in my electorate who said that, with this classification system of SAM, CAM and OCRE, et cetera, he had had to put on four extra staff and spend an extra $30,000 on computers just to handle it; you have to work two accounting systems because the supervisors will not allow a normal accounting system to take place; you are forever shuffling figures and, if someone passes on, you have to try to get someone in who falls into the same classification figure, otherwise you fall under your budget&mdash;it just drives them insane. He, like every other nursing home provider to whom I have spoken in my electorate&mdash;and I have spoken to them all, except for one small one&mdash;is rubbing his hands in glee at what we are proposing in this area. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3785">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On top of that, there is another compassionate move for which I applaud the minister. We are going to fund at a higher level those who suffer from dementia and those who fall into the `financially disadvantaged persons' category. That is sadly needed, particularly with dementia patients because a lot of these homes cannot take them. It is very hard to get a dementia patient into a nursing home these days. They need a high level of care and they are funded at a much lower level. In some instances, special dementia wings will be able to be put on. This is something that I think is long overdue: our aged people being given a higher standard of care, a standard they deserve for the contribution they have made to the country in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would now make some comments about child care. All grants, rebates and everything else remain for every type of child care that is provided&mdash;and there are certainly many of them. There is community, public long day care, family day care, after school hours care, occasional child care&mdash;and the list goes on. All those remain in place, except for one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are taking away the operational grant from community long day care which we put in place a quarter of a century ago when we were in power back in 1972, I think it was, to give community long day care a sort of kick-start because there were hardly any private providers for similar facilities at that time. On average, it works out at about $20 per child per day. It has outlived its usefulness, I believe. In fact, in most electorates the private long day care places outnumber the community long day care places, and they can provide the same service for approximately the same price. I think, on average, Australia-wide it is only about $4 more, even though they start off on $20 per day per child less. So we are removing that. We are putting in place a lot of operational grants to overcome that, including one specifically for $8.3 million so they can hire management and financial consultants to tell them how they can lift their game.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only last Saturday morning I had the great pleasure of opening a private long day childcare community centre in the town of Parkes in my electorate. It will cater for 70 children, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> zero to five years old&mdash;a magnificent facility. I take my hat off to Craig and Judy Wotton who have put this in place. They have two now in Orange and one in Blayney, and I think they still have one in Queensland where they came from. They have just opened this one in Parkes, and they are about to start up another one in Forbes in my electorate which I welcome very much.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The one which has just opened is called the Cheeky Cherubs. It is very modern. Of all the centres I have seen around the country, I have not seen a better one. They are charging $29 per day per child, on average, whereas the occasional child-care facility up the road, a community one&mdash;which does a wonderful job, which I have supported greatly in the past and which the local council have thrown their weight behind&mdash;is charging something like $30 day. It makes you wonder.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the time has come when the community facilities could upgrade and perhaps not send their representatives away to seminars during working hours&mdash;they can attend them after 5 o'clock in the afternoon&mdash;and all these sorts of things. This is taxpayers' money we are talking about. So I do applaud the minister's valuable and innovative suggestion in this area.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to report on more good news concerning western Sydney. I am pleased to say to this parliament that I had the honour of representing the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) at a Mass of Life to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Diocese of Parramatta and the anniversary of the ordination of the Most Reverend Bede Heather, first Bishop of Parramatta.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Mass of Life was celebrated at St Patrick's Blacktown. The Academy of St Cecilia&mdash;a 100&hyphen;voice choir and 50&hyphen;piece orchestra&mdash;provided a most moving musical <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3786"> backdrop to this major religious service. The Academy of St Cecilia was founded at Maryong in my electorate of Greenway in 1994 by Father Arthur Bridge OAM to support and develop the vast choral and instrumental talents in the western region of Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The academy achieves this by providing scholarships for the musical education of the region's young musicians, the commissioning of sacred music and a full performance schedule. It currently has a total membership of 220, with a 120&hyphen;member adult choir, a 60&hyphen;piece orchestra and a 40&hyphen;member junior choir.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The aim of the Academy of St Cecilia is to bring music of quality to the western region of Sydney through the continuance of accomplished performance. The music performed by the academy is primarily of the classical sacred type. The program for 1996 includes music from Bach, Stainer and Faure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In its short, two&hyphen;year history, the academy has participated in a number of performances, both sacred and secular, which have attracted large audiences and have earned the academy wide acclaim. The performances have been as diverse as the Mass of Life and a performance at the rugby union test between South Africa and Australia at the Sydney Football Stadium.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Early in 1997, the academy will be releasing its first commercial recording featuring <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mass of Life</EMPHASIS> along with other works by Father Abdallah, described by the academy's president, Father Arthur Bridge, as the newest, freshest talent within the Australian Catholic musical scene at this time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australian born Reverend Geoffrey Abdallah, Director of the Australian Maronite Music and Liturgical Commission, was acclaimed from a young age as a talented pianist. He won numerous awards and graduated in 1988 with a Bachelor of Music degree from the University of Sydney. Father Geoffrey has studied extensively since then in Sydney, London and Paris. He composed <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mass of Life</EMPHASIS> to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Parramatta Diocese.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mass of Life</EMPHASIS>, said Father Geoffrey, reflects the life of the diocese in times of tragedy and ashes recently experienced with the horrific <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> burning of St Patrick's Cathedral at Parramatta and also in times of radiance and glory. This fine performance by the Academy of St Cecilia was both a fitting recognition of the work carried out by Bishop Bede and a promotion of the musical talent of people living in western Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The academy is non&hyphen;sectarian, and members from many denominations are in its ranks. It has awarded a large number of young achiever scholarships, ranging from a modest $250 to $2,000 to assist with tuition and development. I am delighted that this musical academy has been established in the electorate of Greenway and I look forward to its continuing growth in the interests of music lovers in western Sydney.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I would like to speak about the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Skateboarding</EMPHASIS>  magazine volume 2, edition No. 3. It has been drawn to my attention by a constituent of mine with a son nearly 16 years old. This particular lady is very well aware of the potential problems for any young Australian male in particular&mdash;a group who are at high risk of suicide. In fact, it is the biggest killer of males under 25.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Young Australians, as you know, Mr Acting Speaker, need a sense of discipline and direction. They certainly do not get it from this magazine. It is filled with four&hyphen;letter words&mdash;and I am not going to waste the time of the House by talking about this aspect&mdash;but I would like to turn to two matters on the same page of this magazine, page 15. The page entitled Skate Pain starts with a rather colourful rendition:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Being stoned helps me skate! But it does have its drawbacks . . . bronchial wall thickening in mid and lower zones, chronic inflammation!</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to talk about a recent chest X&hyphen;ray which the person who wrote this had undertaken and how they had been `in a semi&hyphen;coma type dimension for the last four years' and thoughts had rushed to their mind: `Quit, no way! I'll just smoke myself to death.' I quote further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do feel guilty when I light up breakfast but let's face it, how can you skate to work straight. I just <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3787"> love all the difficult types of beautiful smokes I've ever smoked.</PARA>
<PARA>It has a photo proof of the damage which has apparently been done to lungs by the inhaling of marijuana and yet this magazine continues to lampoon this matter with words like:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I can't remember the last day I didn't have at least one toke on a reefer . . . no memory, blurred vision, can't talk, sore chest, burnt fingers, beer belly, sore arm from lifting the billy, mull seems to ease the pain of slamming . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This is clearly ridiculous stuff, yet it is printed up in full colour. It is a quality production but it is absolute rubbish. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Then there is the letters section on this page and `Dear Abby' it certainly is not. There is a letter from a 14&hyphen;year&hyphen;old who attends a boarding school, and this student says they dislike their school because they administer the cane there and there is nowhere to skate. This is aimed at people, particularly males, in their early&hyphen; to mid&hyphen;teens. They talk about students from the country, calling them `feral faggots' who give them a hard time about skating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there is advice from a no doubt fictitious cretin called Arthur Fonzarelli to this 14&hyphen;year&hyphen;old boarding school student. It is an absolute disgrace. The options presented to this 14&hyphen;year&hyphen;old student&mdash;members opposite might be interested in listening closely to this&mdash;are they should go to the biggest `feral' which gives them the most&mdash;and they use a four&hyphen;letter word which I will translate as `gives you the hardest time'&mdash;and the advice is to use their skateboard and crack them over the head with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But then the other advice is to get yourself expelled.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then they go to the absolute lowest possible denominator. The worst and most sickening advice is: `Buy a gun (SKS semi-auto&mdash;big, loud and makes huge holes in flesh).' This is an absolutely sickening comment and one which needs no-one in this place or anywhere else to make a joke about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important the editors of this particular trashy magazine understand life is not like a computer game such as Duke Nukem 3-D. While most people can distinguish the difference between reality and fantasy, messages like this make it very hard on impressionable <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> young males in this country who are looking for some sort of peer identity figure to aim for. I firmly believe messages like this must not be in magazines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are we going to do? I think it is important the editors of this magazine get their house in order or get out of business and the publishers, Mason Stewart Pty Ltd of Darlinghurst, better have a close look at the rubbish they are printing. I warn parents to take a closer look, and I call on the censors to get their act together. After all, prohibition is not going to work, but we really do need to see the publishers taking some responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our young people need direction, encouragement and a sense of discipline to get them started in life. Young Australians have been doing it hard. Rubbish like that printed in this particular magazine is not going to make it any easier for any of them.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise this evening a matter concerning a constituent of mine, a Mr Brian Leehy, who is the principal of a company called PCS International Pty Ltd and the unfortunate dealings that his company has had with the National Australia Bank. In 1992, PCS obtained the contract for movement of fresh food produce on behalf of a company called Oz Fresh Produce (Australia) Pty Ltd operating in Werribee. PCS sought a credit reference from the Block Credit Reporting Agency and a banker's opinion from the National Australia Bank. The latter was sought in August 1992. The National Australia Bank denies that it was sought this early.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Block credit report was received by PCS on 15 September of that year. The report mentioned that the managing director of Oz Fresh, Mr Robert Thompson, had previously worked for the National Australia Bank for 26 years, including some time at the western branch where the Oz Fresh account was held. The National Australia Bank points out that there was some substantial gap in employment between the time Mr Thompson was with the National Australia Bank and the time he was with Oz Fresh.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3788">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By this time, Mr Leehy became concerned at the fact that he had still received no response from the bank to his credit inquiry, several weeks having gone by. Through his own bank, the Commonwealth Bank at Yarraville, he pressed for a quick reply. On 18 September, PCS presented an Oz Fresh cheque to the National Australia Bank for $20,000 which was later returned by the bank with the annotation `present again on 29 September'. Mr Leehy then notified Oz Fresh that PCS would no longer do business with them, having incurred very substantial costs by undertaking freight tasks for Oz Fresh without having yet received payment for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 2 October, the National Australia Bank advised that the cheque would be paid in seven days, which the bank now denies, and finally provided the credit opinion to Mr Leehy. On the same day, a stop was placed on the cheque. Mr Leehy was not notified of this until 9 October, the day when payment had been promised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 7 October, receivers were appointed to take over the management of Oz Fresh. National Australia Bank says that the payee would not be told in advance when payment on a cheque is stopped but would only be told on presentation. As a result of these events, Mr Leehy's company has gone into insolvency. In effect, Mr Leehy as a small business person has lost everything and is, to the best of my knowledge, still unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He advises me that the former freight forwarders used by Oz Fresh were a company called International Trade Management, which he worked for previously. He states that this company was previously owned by the National Australia Bank and that it was introduced to Oz Fresh by the National Australia Bank. He also states that the bank was the major creditor involved in the winding up of Oz Fresh, which was recently completed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> These facts are rather disturbing on the face of them. I have raised them with the bank on behalf of Mr Leehy and have not received any satisfactory response. At the very least, there is a distinct appearance that the bank, in order to protect its own financial interests with respect to the difficulties that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Oz Fresh was encountering, was less than open and less than frank in its dealings with Mr Leehy, who clearly was very concerned about the possibility that the Oz Fresh company's difficulties might end him up in the situation where he has indeed found himself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Theoretically, he could take legal proceedings against the National Australia Bank with respect to the advice that he has been given&mdash;probably under the old Hedley Byrne v. Heller principle&mdash;but, of course, he is in no position to do so because the outcome of such proceedings would not be guaranteed and they would also require very substantial sums of money to be risked. The correspondence I have had with the National Australia Bank has produced replies that I do not think fully explain the position. There is at least a strong perception that the bank has acted in a less than satisfactory way in dealing with this situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I call on the National Australia Bank in the chamber tonight to look at this situation again and to review its whole involvement in this affair and the intertwining sets of relationships, particularly the close relationship between the bank and Oz Fresh, which may have led to it acting in a way which has been to the detriment of my constituent, Mr Leehy, and to finally give him some fair treatment to recover from the situation in which he has found himself.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this evening to announce the government's support for a financially viable international garden festival which is proposed to be held in my electorate of Robertson. In 1994, a former member for Robertson, the Hon. Barry Cohen, on behalf of the Nursery Industry Association of Australia, was successful in securing the rights for Australia to hold the year 2000 international garden festival. A search was then on to find a suitable site to hold this magnificent event. A site owned by the New South Wales Department of Juvenile Justice at Mount Penang, overlooking Gosford on the New South Wales Central Coast, was identified as the most favourable site.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3789">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The then Fahey state government committed over $1 million to undertake a feasibility study for the project, and all looked hopeful for the festival to proceed. Many obstacles had to be overcome, including a reluctance from the then member for Robertson, Frank Walker, to support the project. The support of this festival then became a major election issue in the seat of Robertson, and the will of the community was borne out when they elected me as the member for Robertson as part of the Howard-Fischer government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A definitive feasibility study was then conducted by Traceys Pty Ltd. This study revealed some outstanding and amazing figures on this event. The Planet Earth 2000 International Garden Festival will attract 5.5 million visitors, four times the number of visitors who will attend the Sydney Olympics; a quantum investment in the event and its end use development in the order of $230 million; projected costs and revenues that indicate a break&hyphen;even for the event; an end use asset with a value in the order of $40 million to $50 million; economic output of $1,500 million; economic input to the event of $780 million; 18,000 jobs or equivalent person years of employment will be created by the festival; and it will have significant tax revenues for the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most importantly, Planet Earth 2000 will be privately funded. To enable the project to proceed, we required the endorsement of the federal, the New South Wales and local levels of government. Last month, Premier Carr announced that the New South Wales government would provide the 58 hectare site and $300,000 in initial funding. Both Wyong and Gosford councils have also committed considerable funds to this project. Last Friday, 6 September, in a letter to Premier Carr, Prime Minister John Howard announced:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth Government supports the concept of a commercially viable international garden festival and is willing to consider an appropriate Commonwealth contribution consistent with national responsibilities for such an event.</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister continued by saying that the Commonwealth would be prepared to consider limited financial assistance to facilitate further development of the IGF concept, including examination of the scope for the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> private sector investment to underpin the viability of this proposal. Mr Russ Higginbotham, the President of the Nursery Industry Association of Australia, flew out of Sydney this evening to take these letters of support to the 48th Congress of the Association of International Horticultural Producers being held in Budapest, Hungary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It must be stressed that the Planet Earth 2000 festival will be privately funded and must be commercially viable. If the festival is to proceed, private sector funding must be in place by May 1997. Already several major Australian and international companies have expressed keen interest in this project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Planet Earth 2000 International Garden Festival is more than a flower show; it is a project of vision and excitement. This project presents a singular opportunity for Australia to stage a major international event, together with the legacy of an ongoing centre of excellence in the year 2000. The eyes of the world will focus on Australia not only because of the Olympic Games in the year 2000 but also because of the showcasing of our nation as an innovative leader in horticulture, primary industries, care and management of the environment, and related technologies, particularly in the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During today's grievance debate I expressed my concern about the compulsory competitive tendering process being taken up by Victorian local government. As a result of the CCT process there is a new structure developing for local government in Victoria. At its ultimate end, in local government we will have the elected council together with a small number of directors, plus maybe an independent unit to process the tendering, to form the actual council. All the other parts will be either by private contractors providing services or by in-house business units providing services. Even the in-house business units will be separated from the council and the direc <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3790"> tors because they will have tendered under distinct specifications.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At a time when local government in Victoria has been dominated by unelected commissioners appointed by the state government, it is now a chance for us to consider what will happen when elected councillors return in nearly all of the municipalities in March of next year to add to the elected councillors that returned in March of this year. Those elected councillors will have a completely different role of local government because they will be stuck with the specifications for tenders for services that have been put together by the commissioners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Imagine what will happen when there is a change of council as a result of elections if that group of councillors has a different ideology and a different view on the way things should be done. They will be unable to promote great change until the tenders that are carrying over actually come up again for tender. It has left some of those who are considering returning to stand for election as councillors with a feeling of futility because they believe that, as a result of the Victorian government's insistence on the CCT process, their hands would be tied in being able to best serve the people who elected them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another aspect about this move towards tendering that has concerned me is especially in the area of state and federal government where we ourselves are putting out for tender things that have been traditionally done by non-government organisations and the community sector. This has led to great uncertainty for these organisations because the tenders, unfortunately, are usually on an annual basis. It means that there is this cycle that they have to enter into where they have to do the work of going forward and putting in tenders. They do not know until the tender is given whether they are to proceed beyond, say, a 12-month period. Many of them had fought and fought hard. Under a direct funding regime they achieved programatic funding where at least they knew that there was some certainty over a three-year period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing about the tendering process is the competitive nature. Some of these non-government organisations put in a lot of their <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> own resources. I think it leads to an efficiency where we have the best use of government financing and the best use of community input. But what we are seeing with the competitive and predatory nature of some of the funding rounds is that there is decreasing and diminishing cooperation between some of these NGOs. They are unwilling to share knowledge or share ideas with some of those organisations working in similar fields for fear that they will be beaten in the competition for tendering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is something that I believe leads to inefficiencies in the way in which we are providing services. There are too scarce resources to allow us the luxury of throwing away the opportunities that cooperation brings. That is why it is with a little bit of dismay that I read in this year's budget of the creation of a service delivery agency. Most of us would have no problem with the idea of a one&hyphen;stop shop for government services; it is the model which is proposed in the budget that causes great concern, where departments will come into agreements with the yet to be named agency to provide services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the moment we know that DSS and DEETYA will have their customer service sections hived off to the agency. There is some suggestion that some of the pension payment processes will go to the agency. The great concern is that, at some stage down the track, this agency will be corporatised and have the opportunity to be put in private hands. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to bring to the attention of the House a very important event that occurred in my electorate on 20 July&mdash;the opening of our $50 million Cairns Convention Centre. This is something of significant importance to our area, appreciating that tourism is the lifeblood of the Cairns economy. Locals know that Far North Queensland has some of the world's most stunning scenery, a warm tropical climate and a friendly, relaxed lifestyle only dreamt about by the broader population.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3791"> I believe that the opening of the conference centre will provide many fantastic opportuni ties for our local economy, and there is no doubt that our dominance in the tourist market will continue. The spin-off effects to Cairns and regional communities from the convention centre will be enormous. With a world&hyphen;class facility in a region renowned for its natural beauty, the Cairns Convention Centre will give any convention destination in the world a run for its money. It will also give the opportunity for many more visitors to explore our area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Presently Cairns International Airport has 68 inbound international flights per week from more than 20 overseas cities and 10 different international carriers. This represents a huge potential client pool for the convention centre. It clearly shows that direct access to Cairns is readily available, and this will be yet another positive marketing tool that will assist in ensuring the long-term viability of this magnificent establishment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The convention centre was some 18 months in construction. There were some 35 contractors and suppliers on site, 25 of whom were from the far north, with 140 of the 160 site workers being local people. The development of the centre has marked a new era in the growth of Cairns, replacing a landscape of oil storage tanks in what could be considered to be a run down port area of the old town of Cairns with a graceful public building.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The convention centre is Australia's first environmentally designed public building. As well as incorporating the most advanced communication technology, the building will showcase the latest energy and resource conservation techniques and innovative environmental design. The Cairns Convention Centre's double layer pleated plate roof is designed to capture the season's torrential tropical downpours and channel rainwater directly into the storage tanks. This feature will provide half of the centre's ground and garden watering needs, reducing its call on treated town water. The centre's water usage will be further cut with the installation of water flow restricters on all outlets, with expected water savings of between 25 and 30 per cent of our total water needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have a significant energy saving, with solar hot water heaters providing 30 to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 35 per cent of the centre's hot water needs thus producing a significant saving on electricity usage and costs. I support the energy and resource conservation techniques incorporated into the design of the Cairns Convention Centre. These innovative techniques will show that Australia continues to be a world leader in this field.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity to complete a tragedy in three parts. I was talking earlier about the service delivery agency. The agency will have a service agreement with each department to provide its services. The government's glossy brochure about the agency states that, `In the future other Commonwealth government services will be added to the agency. . . '; for example, the customer services functions of the Department of Health and Family Services, or perhaps some service functions of the Department headed by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock), who is at the table. The agency might then be required to put in a tender for the work. The department might choose to award the tender to an agency or, indeed, to another delivery provider; for example, the existing chain of Medicare offices&mdash;although I understand that perhaps the child-care payments that have been made through Medicare offices might be made through this agency. </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3792">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to the right&hyphen;wing ideology behind competitive tendering, the agency would be privatised down the track. It would compete with other networks of offices for each department's tender and ultimately retender for the DSS and DEETYA work when and if the service agreements expire. It is interesting to note that on DEETYA's own diagram of its proposed structural arrangements, the relationship between DEETYA and the service delivery agency is no different from that between DEETYA and the proposed contracted EPEs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When considering the legislation creating the agency, the government's future intentions for the delivery of Commonwealth services and the ideology behind these intentions will have to be examined very carefully.  </PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)(a) Telstra and Optus have advised that they regard information about the cost of  local calls as commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">According to the 1996 NUS International survey of  telephone prices, the average price to consumers of a local phone call in Australia is 22.5 cents. This survey does not include a more recent local call pricing initiative by Telstra in which it offers a 15 per cent discount off local calls for customer local call expenditure of between $15 and $100. The survey does not also include Optus' recent announcement of its local call charge of 20 cents for its directly connected customers (and 15 cents on `special days').</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)(b) Telstra and Optus have advised that they regard information about the cost of long distance calls as commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">According to current filed tariffs, Telstra customers are charged STD rates determined largely by distance and by the time of day at which the call is made. Telstra STD charges comprise an initial charge of 12 cents and a further amount in cents, per chargeable period (one second). There are three time periods applied to STD charging; the day period being Monday to Friday, 8 am to 6 pm, the night period, being Monday to Thursday between 6 pm and 10 pm, and the economy period, being <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3795"> Monday to Thursday, 10 pm to 8 am, and Friday 6pm until 8 am Monday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to the flag fall charge of twelve cents, charges for a call over a distance of more than 25 km but less than 50 km would thus be charged at .20465 cents per chargeable period during the day, at 0.14749 cents per period at night and .09259 cents during the economy period. In contrast, a call over a distance of more than 745km would be charged at a maximum of .73383 cents during the day, .55556 at night and .29333 during the economy period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Optus provides a flat&hyphen;rate for national long distance calls. Weekend long distance calls are charged at ten cents per minute, while off&hyphen;peak long distance calls are charged at 20 cents per minute. The new tariff is cheaper for calls over 100kms away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 1996 NUS International survey found that the price of a three minute call over a distance of 320 km was 90 cents, a drop of 5.3 per cent on the previous year. This comparison does not include the Optus flat&hyphen;rate initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Telstra and Optus have advised that they regard information about the cost of providing calls as commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">According to the 1996 NUS survey, Australia remains one of the most expensive for local calls, with a price of 22.5 cents for a three minute call compared to 18.3 cents in the UK, 14.5 cents in Sweden and no charge in Canada. Again, this survey does not include a more recent local call pricing initiative by Telstra in which it offers a 15 per cent discount off local calls for customer local call expenditure of between $15 and $100. The survey also does not include Optus' recent announcement of its local call charge of 20 cents for its directly connected customers (and 15 cents on `special days').</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is the only country of those surveyed which operates local calls on a timed and untimed basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over a longer duration local call, Australia is comparatively cheaper, with the 1996 INTUG/ECTUA Telecom Costs survey finding that prices, in $US for a 5 minute local call in Australia was 19 cents, which was the average price for all countries surveyed. Canada and Hong Kong (both free), Greece (8 cents), Iceland (9 cents), Italy (16 cents), Netherlands (17 cents), New Zealand (12 cents), Spain (14 cents), Sweden (12 cents), and the USA (15 cents) were all cheaper than Australia, whilst Belgium (33 cents), Germany (32 cents) and Switzerland (47 cents) were some of the countries well in excess of the Australian price.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In regard to long distance calls, NUS found that Australia ranks 7th of the 12 countries surveyed. An STD call (3 minutes) in Australia over 320 <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> kilometres is priced at 90 cents, as compared with $2.34 in Japan, $1.15 in New Zealand and 40 cents in Sweden. The INTUG ECTUA survey of prices (in $US) over 100 km for a 3 minute call, found that Australia ranked 10th, with prices 13 cents below the average of the 25 countries surveyed. In relation to a five minute call, there were nine <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3796"> countries whose prices were cheaper than Australia's.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">With regard to the co&hyphen;location of facilities, particularly underground cabling, the true extent of existing capacity has, until now, been unclear. At my request in April 1996, AUSTEL conducted an audit which indicates that the availability of Telstra <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3800"> duct space for Optus Vision's (or anyone else's) cable averages less than 30% overall, and is fragmented in such a way that useable contiguous duct spacing represents only a very small fraction of the total network route length. The audit also indicates that the difference in costs between overhead and underground cabling for a new network are very significant, and any business case must strongly favour aerial deployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Government recognises the visual detriment to residential amenity which can be occasioned by overhead cabling, particularly power cabling. I am investigating, with State Ministers, the nature and extent of co&hyphen;operative funding arrangements for undergrounding of power cabling and possible ways in which telecommunications carriers might participate in such arrangements. The rollout of telecommunications networks, whilst being a commercial matter for determination by the carriers, will nevertheless be subject to tightened consultation requirements under the revised Telecommunications National Code and Land Access Code, which will be finalised following receipt of AUSTEL's report on the draft codes released for public comment in July 1996. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA></ANSWER></ANSWER.TO.QON>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr Costello</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Assistant Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) In the 1995/96 financial year the CSA identified 76 cases where it failed to intercept tax refunds due to clerical error. In addition, during the period 2 November 1995 to 17 November 1995 a computer system error resulted in 3,546 income tax refunds issuing to payers. Most of these tax refunds should have been intercepted (via the Tax Refund Intercept Program&mdash;TRIPS) for the purpose of offsetting child support debts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Yes, for example, in the 1994/95 financial year the CSA identified 58 cases where it failed to intercept tax refunds, due to human or clerical error, which should have been intercepted (via the Tax Refund Intercept Project&mdash;TRIPS) for the purpose of offsetting child support debts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Where a liability is registered for collection, the CSA has a duty to collect it. If the failure of the CSA to collect child support amounts to negligence, the CSA pays compensation. Further, where a payee advises the CSA of its failure to intercept a tax refund, and the CSA fails to take steps to recover the debt within a reasonable time, the CSA may pay compensation. People in this <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3815"> second situation should make a claim in writing to the CSA office which they deal with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) The CSA has a standard for replying in 28 days to client correspondence requiring a response. However for complex issues such as compensation claims, the CSA would usually advise that a response may take longer. In the case of compensation claims it is often difficult to resolve legal issues and in some instances advice must be sought from the Australian Government Solicitor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) There was no national statement or policy issued by the CSA on 18 March 1996 stating that affected clients would be notified of an outcome of the ongoing review of their cases within 28 days. However the Agency is aware of one case in which a client was advised by a branch officer that this would occur and it is possible that this happened to more than one client. The National Office of the CSA has issued a direction to all CSA branch offices notifying staff that they should not give this undertaking to affected clients until the outcome of a comprehensive review into the matter is known.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) (As answered in 3) When a payee advises the CSA of its failure to intercept a tax refund, if the CSA fails to take steps to recover the debt within a reasonable time, the CSA may pay compensation.</PARA>
