<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset of my speech on the migration legislation, I would like to indicate some concerns I have with the comments made by the previous speaker in this debate, the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson). Specifically, at page 7,716 of yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Proof Hansard</EMPHASIS> , the member for Bradfield said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Hanson phenomenon . . . has its origins . . . in the failure of the previous government to listen to a sense of growing unease with the continued advocacy, frequently with religious fervour, of multiculturalism.</PARA>
<PARA>On the following page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Proof Hansard</EMPHASIS> , he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a phenomenon which in many ways could be expected as a response to the stifling imposition of values and thinking by the former Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA>They are comments which I would like to address and address with some intensity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the honourable member is referring to the approach of the former Labor government to issues concerning the mix of cultures in our society and our immigration policy, I suggest, with respect, that he could do no better than read the launch of the former Labor government's policy on 20 January 1996 by Paul Keating, the then Prime Minister. I will not read the entire speech, just some of his comments. He said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . when you open yourself up to the world, when you are brave enough to look cultural difference in the eye, you learn a great deal. And half of what you learn is about yourself. And you are made stronger by that and more mature.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is what I mean by immigration being essentially an exchange. For everything we have given to the people from 160 countries who have come here, we have been repaid. For a new start in life, they repaid Australia in their energy, ideas and ambitions, in their skills and in their culture. But, just as importantly, in the greater maturity, self-knowledge and the courage they have given us.</PARA>
<PARA>As for the so-called stifling approach of the former Prime Minister, I can say that Mr Keating spoke about this suggestion more recently when addressing the University of New South Wales. He referred to the `timid little creatures' like Bruce Ruxton, Alan Jones and Graeme Campbell, who he said seemed remarkably undeterred. He also referred to the fact that letters, newspaper columns and talkback radio shows were notably not unforthcoming in their criticism of him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On not one occasion in this House have I heard anyone refer with specific words to an instance where the former Prime Minister attempted to stifle, limit or restrict any debate regarding Australia's immigration policy. The former Prime Minister did say something about the expression `political correctness'. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it has provided a useful smokescreen for some crude turnings in the national debate. And in the smoke a very ugly, resentful and xenophobic cat has been let out of the bag.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what we get down to in the member for Bradfield's speech, in terms of attempting to attribute the source of this current unfortunate and highly damaging racial debate&mdash;who let that cat out of the bag?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to 10 September, which was the date the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) made her maiden speech, the present Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is on record on numerous occasions as having preached, with almost a religious fervour, a condemnation of this concept of `political correctness'. It is interesting and informative to look at the way the present Prime Minister has approached that topic. In an address to the Queensland division of the Liberal Party in Brisbane on 29 <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> August 1996, just 12 days prior to the member for Oxley's maiden speech, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we face, turning around the cultural attitudes in some areas, getting rid of some of the obsession with political correctness in our society but at the same time not embracing an excessive intolerance of legitimate dissent and legitimate minority points of view.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise the words `excessive intolerance' and draw that phrase to the attention of this House. In other words, intolerance is okay; intolerance is fine. It is `excessive intolerance' that the Prime Minister objects to. Well, with respect to the Prime Minister, either you are tolerant or you are intolerant. You are not tolerant or excessively intolerant. That puts it well and truly into perspective. What did the Prime Minister say after the member for Oxley made her maiden speech on 10 September? He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People know that the views that I expressed on free speech and political correctness were expressed long before, long before Pauline Hanson made her maiden speech in Parliament. She had a right to say what she thought.</PARA>
<PARA>Under, for instance, section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act, would she have had the right to have said it if she had not been in this House? I would remind honourable members that section makes it unlawful for any person to do an act `that is reasonably likely in all the circumstances to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate another person or a group of people' because of their `race, colour, or national or ethnic origin'. In the context of section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, if the member for Oxley had not been in this House and had not had the protection of qualified privilege, would she have been able to lawfully say outside this House what she said in her maiden speech? She said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe we are in danger of being swamped by Asians.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They have their own culture and religion, form ghettos and do not assimilate.</PARA>
<PARA>Further, the member for Oxley referred to an extract from a speech of the late Arthur Calwell, then Leader of the Opposition, in which he said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8086">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Japan, India, Burma, Ceylon and every new African nation are fiercely anti&hyphen; white and anti one another. Do we want or need any of these people here?</PARA>
<PARA>The member for Oxley said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have no hesitation in echoing the words of Arthur Calwell.</PARA>
<PARA>Did she have a right to say that? Did she have a right in this House to breach those principles contained in the Racial Discrimination Act and to start off what is perhaps one of the most stupidly embarrassing and damaging phases of Australia's economic outlook and, indeed, its social morality, the full extent of which is only recently coming to light? I ask the member for Bradfield: who, in those circumstances, was responsible for letting the cat out of the bag? This is one instance where I would agree with the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans), in that this cat needs to be put down. But it can only be put down by one person, the Prime Minister, unequivocally and unreservedly coming out and condemning those statements which have been made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our system of government is challenged in reality whenever minorities are excluded from effective participation in our society by government decisions, even when those decisions reflect the will of the majority. In other words, our system of government is predicated on all Australians having a fair go. It goes without saying that they cannot have a fair go if they cannot communicate. That is precisely what the inability to speak English is in this country. It is an inability to communicate. It is an inability to be a productive member of our economy and our society. It is the inability to have your voice heard by government. It is the inability to raise a family in a confident and secure fashion so that they become productive and contented members of our society. In short, it is isolation from mainstream Australia. For our nation, the inability to communicate means institutionalised disadvantage, it means inevitable division, it means inevitable frustration and it means inevitable pressures arising from discontent and resentment. For our nation's economy it means having a sector which is unproductive and underutilised. It is in the context of those remarks that I address and speak against this bill, which restricts the ability of new settlers to obtain English skills.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the purposes of the bill is to roll the health services charge and the English education charge into one visa application fee. The health charge itself has increased from $840 to about $2,500, and the English education fee has also increased to $5,500, making a combined figure of about $8,000. The bill also amends the Immigration (Education) Act 1971 to sever the connection between it and the Immigration (Education) Charge Act and limits the liability of the Commonwealth to provide English language tuition in all cases to 510 hours, irrespective of the competence obtained by the student immigrant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill, in so doing, will only accentuate anti&hyphen;migrant sentiments that are unquestionably being cunningly and opportunistically manipulated for short&hyphen;term political gain. The government's focus should be on empowering new arrivals to fend for themselves. That empowerment fundamentally involves learning English. In the case of many of those migrants, given the drive and quite literally the pioneering spirit that they reflect, once they are taught English it is simply a matter of getting out of their way and letting them succeed for themselves, for their families and for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) himself has recognised the essentiality of English skills if new arrivals are to succeed. On 3 July this year, the minister said that research has consistently shown that good English skills are the key factor to labour market and overall settlement success for new immigrants. Yet the government has cut 120 adult migrant English classes. In my electorate of Barton the number of such classes has been reduced from 18 to just three.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, the cap of 510 hours is one which is arbitrary and unrealistic. The tragedy is that we have a very significant resource base in our migrant population and it is simply a matter of tapping into that. I draw the analogy of anyone who has bought an expensive piece of equipment, whether it is a computer, a metal press or whatever. That piece of equipment is all but useless, it lies on the factory floor or in a wasted corner of an office, unless it is properly introduced and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8087"> properly installed, so that it communicates and functions with the rest of the enterprise; indeed, until the operator of that machine is properly trained. Once the operator and the machine are properly installed, they usually become extremely productive units.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is precisely my point regarding new arrivals to Australia&mdash;they are a great source of talent and enterprise. What we need to do is properly install them into our society, our economy and our political system by affording them proper English training. From my point of view, any money spent in up&hyphen;skilling those new arrivals is an investment not only in their future but in Australia's future.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1995&hyphen;96, for instance, 38,660 new arrivals were taught English. No&hyphen;one, I would suggest, could sensibly say that was a waste of money. It was, as I have stressed, an investment in our future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fairness to the member for Bradfield, in his speech he dispelled suggestions that migration has caused unemployment. I note that the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, in a recent fact sheet entitled `Immigration and Unemployment' has also confirmed that analysis and, again, dispelled the suggestion that migration has caused unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the fact sheet shows, however, is that lack of English skills chronically retards the ability of new arrivals to obtain employment. It results in the fact that they find employment where they do&mdash;usually in industries which are hardest hit by recession, so they are the first ones to lose their jobs. Indeed, from my experience in a former capacity, I know that new arrivals featured more frequently in the injury and workers compensation court lists. Some ignorant people said that was because of a particular disposition. I would always say to those people: look at the trades they were in. Inevitably, they were in the heavier, dangerous, dirty, labouring occupations&mdash;again, because of their lack of English skills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> All of these things, all of these aspects of the difficulty that a number of new arrivals have because they are unable to communicate and to contribute fully to our society and our economy, have a flow&hyphen;on effect of contribut ing to the racial debate. Those who would seek to foster that debate point to their lack of success, their isolation and the fact that, perhaps because of their inability to broadly communicate, they may in many instances communicate more frequently amongst themselves. All of these things can be broken down with a bit of effort and a bit of foresight. Crucial among those are English language skills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is unfortunate that the government in this bill is increasing the English language charge and is also restricting English language training in all cases to 510 hours. There is a real risk that unless the situation is redressed, unless each and every migrant who comes here receives proper English language training, we are creating intergenerational poverty. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recent survey of Arabic speaking youth in my electorate indicated that 20 to 30 per cent of Arabic speaking youths in my area drop out of school. Their unemployment rate is 14 per cent higher than the Australian average. Almost universally, those Arabic speaking youths who were questioned said that the disadvantage they suffered from most intensely was a lack of English skills in their family and hence the confidence and security that they had both within that family and in terms of their expectations and ability for career development.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is something that we can easily work at. The government should not be taking a populist approach on this matter. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Public debate on the issue of migration has dominated the media over recent months and has experienced a bit of a resurgence of late. One theme that has been running behind this public debate over migration has been the call for zero net migration or, further still, zero migration intake. `Let us have zero migration until Australia's unemployment problems have been solved' is what is being said. The solution to unemployment in Australia is simply not that simple. Australia needs an appropriate level of migration. Economically, it is essential that Australia maintain a functional and balanced migration intake program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a good letter to the editor in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> recently from Mr Don Plimer from <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8088"> Cook, ACT. Against the hypothetical prospect of a zero immigration policy, Mr Plimer put forward three scenarios. In one scenario, Mr Plimer floats the possibility of a large company, such as Cathay Pacific or American Express, wanting to base their regional headquarters in Sydney. `While most new employees would be Australian residents,' Mr Plimer writes, `some key senior staff need to relocate'&mdash;from the US or elsewhere. They probably would need to bring their families as well, but due to a zero immigration policy this would not be possible, despite the fact that, by locating in Australia, the company would create many jobs for Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This scenario bears great similarity to what will be occurring early next year in my electorate of Herbert. Korea Zinc is due to start construction on what will be, when it is completed, a $1 billion zinc refinery plant in Townsville. This is the biggest investment South Korea has ever made in Australia. It is expected to generate about 1,500 jobs locally. When I picked up the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> this morning, I was concerned to read on the front page an article under the headline `Asia poll confirms damage'. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More than half of senior executives in Asia say the race debate has made Australia a less attractive place for investment, according to a poll by one of the region's top business magazines.</PARA>
<PARA>To paraphrase the article, it continues that the survey confirmed anecdotal evidence and widespread media reporting in the region in recent months that the impact of the immigration debate has been uniformly bad for Australia's image.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The part of the article that concerned me most was the section that indicated 80 per cent of South Korean executives surveyed said they were now less likely to invest in Australia. While I believe most opinion polls should be treated with some degree of caution, it would be foolish for small business, tourism and industry operators in Townsville to ignore this report altogether.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Korea Zinc project will be of enormous significance to Townsville and the North Queensland region. It will inject large amounts of money into the local economy. It will provide a large number of skilled jobs in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the region. It has been suggested that Korea Zinc could establish a chemical education centre on site in conjunction with James Cook University or one of the TAFE colleges in Townsville. It will also provide the very real possibility of other developments starting up alongside Korea Zinc as offshoots, for example the development of a fertiliser industry, a sulphuric acid facility and diecast metals production.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As late as last week at the National Trade and Investment Outlook Conference in Melbourne, the President of Korea Zinc, Mr C.K. Choi, said that the fundamental factors that influenced the decision to locate the refinery project in Australia, particularly in Townsville, `will be basically the same as faced by other potential investors in other industries'. Other South Korean investors are watching the Korea Zinc project carefully, with an eye to assessing Australia and Townsville as sites for future projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my first speech to this House I said it was imperative for the government, business and industry to start capitalising on opportunities, such as the one the Korea Zinc project offers&mdash;a $1 billion investment and 1,500 jobs. To now read that some senior Asian executives view Australia as a less attractive place in which to invest is nothing short of feeling as though we are being robbed of job creation opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At certain stages throughout the construction and operational life of the refinery, Korea Zinc will need to bring specialist technicians and company personnel out from Korea to Australia for extended periods of time. Some perhaps would even be permanent. It is unrealistic to suggest that this would not be the case. Therefore, if Australia had a zero migration policy in operation, there would be some difficulties for this project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I guess we are facing two options: either we can tell Korea Zinc to take a hike and take their $1 billion investment elsewhere or we can pursue a properly balanced migration program and reap the benefits of Korea Zinc's investment in Townsville. If we pursue the first option, what do we tell the citizens of Townsville and Thuringowa, who are anxiously waiting for this development? Do we say, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8089"> `Sorry, but we oppose new employment opportunities for Australians'? Do we say, `Let us not worry that no other country outside Australia will want to set up shop because they cannot bring foreign specialists into our country when necessary'? The reality is that we as a country are not going to say that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We could tell them that or we could continue to work along the lines of the current migration program&mdash;a program that properly balances Australia's social, economic and environmental needs; a program that is based on non-discriminatory principles. These bills seek to properly balance Australia's social, economic and environmental needs without discrimination. More importantly, to quote from the second reading speech of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock), these bills seek `to provide the government with the authority to deliver a planned, orderly and balanced migration program'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People at public meetings have said to me, `Yes, the government should introduce a zero immigration policy and it should introduce it straightaway. It will solve our unemployment problems.' But when I tell them that such a prospect in all probability would mean no Korea Zinc in Townsville, no $1 billion investment and no new local job opportunities, then they are likely to say, `But then it should be an exception.' Unfortunately, you cannot have it both ways. A zero immigration policy is not the answer to unemployment in Australia and it is certainly not the answer in Townsville.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the coalition took control of government, it took control of a migration program that was unbalanced and out of control. In 1993-94, the total program allowed about 64,800 migrants. In 1994-95, the figure grew to 76,500, and to 83,000 in 1995-96. The family component of the migration program grew by some 27 per cent in 1995-96. The spouse category, for example, grew by 74 per cent.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Projections clearly showed that, had the coalition not put the brakes on the program, migration levels for 1996-97 would almost certainly have reached 100,000. Depending on your point of view, this might be either good <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> or bad. But the damaging aspect was that the Labor Party allowed a marked imbalance to develop in the program between the skilled and the family components of that program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been generally agreed in the past that the government of the day should have the authority to determine Australia's level and composition of immigration. However, despite the opposition conceding that they could live with a migration program this year of 74,000, we now find that the opposition, led by their shadow spokesman and conspiring with other non-government senators, has disallowed regulations that will assist the government in delivering a balanced migration program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me quickly run through a list of regulations that the Senate recently disallowed: regulations requiring sponsors in the preferential family category to be Australian citizens, a perfectly reasonable regulation; regulations allowing refugees to bring their immediate families into Australia under the humanitarian program; regulations that recognise English language skills in the concessional family category which has a high skills component; regulations which meet the coalition's election commitment to seek full cost recovery of English language tuition charges; and regulations that facilitate the Commonwealth to recoup benefits claimed by migrants within the first two years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have here is an opposition displaying its true colours, obstructing sensible reforms for the sheer sake of obstruction. I think the opposition has taken the term `opposition' too literally. The member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) got it right in the second reading speech when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I note that the honourable member for Denison has indicated that the opposition supports the level of the program the government has announced. The achievement of that program level, and the restoration of the balance between the family and skilled categories that is the key to community support for the program, requires all the measures contained in this bill. If the opposition is not prepared to support these sensible measures, it will be clear to all that they are not serious about achieving a well managed and well structured migration program.</PARA>
<PARA>To the opposition and the minor parties the message should be crystal clear: don't sabotage the solution. The previous government <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8090"> allowed the balance of migration to get out of control. Don't sabotage the solution that we bring before the House today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have already seen the opposition and minor parties in the Senate disallowing measures relating to new migrants' access to certain social security benefits. There was an interesting article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on Tuesday, 26 November by the former Labor minister Peter Walsh which ran under the headline, `Humbug and hypocrisy'. Whilst I may not agree with Mr Walsh's views on many issues, the member for Denison (Mr Kerr) cannot avoid the fact that Mr Walsh is from the Labor side of politics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The article was predominantly about the hypocrisy of the Australian Democrats in supporting Labor's opposition to measures restricting migrants' access to social security. The main point of Mr Walsh's article was that the Democrats backed the ALP the other week on the basis that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Democrats support the prerogative of the Government to set migration numbers but not policies which implement those levels through discriminatory means.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Walsh points out in his article that the Democrats endorse a zero net immigration policy which requires a gross intake of around 30,000 migrants each year. Mr Walsh was a bit perplexed at how the Democrats could support last week's opposition to government measures on the basis that they would be achieved through discriminatory means, yet at the same time also support the reduction of the migration program to 30,000. Walsh writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In their ceaseless quest to pick up any spare vote that might be floating around, the Democrats purport to regard the Refugee, Humanitarian, Concessional and Preferential family categories as sacrosanct. The regulations they voted down sought to limit those numbers to 66,000. A program twice as permissive as the Democrats say should be allowed is denounced by them as too harsh.</PARA>
<PARA>This is why this issue should not be worthy of speculation about a double dissolution of parliament. The behaviour of the Democrats in the Senate on this issue is highly hypocritical. The Democrats' `ceaseless quest to pick up any spare vote that might be floating around', as Mr Walsh describes their behav <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> iour, will not win them any votes. It will only show them up to be headline seeking opportunists. Hopefully, though, those headlines will read more and more along the lines of `Humbug and hypocrisy'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Walsh was a little ingenuous in his article. While describing Labor's actions as politically stupid, he gave the reader the impression that the opposition reluctantly went along with the Democrats' plans. Mr Deputy Speaker, the reverse was actually the case. The architects were in fact the member for Denison and the former Labor minister Senator Bolkus. They are the people who caused the problem of a migration program that was out of control. They are the ones who are sabotaging our solution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I reject the claim from the honourable member for Denison that the language of the immigration minister and other government members on this particular issue is more reminiscent of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) than a responsible government. The coalition in opposition prior to the last election clearly indicated that we would take these steps. There was no smoke; there were no mirrors. If the honourable member for Denison has been so concerned about that particular measure, why hasn't he raised these questions before?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the government is seeking to do is shift the focus of the migration program back towards the skilled migrant category and bring the preferential family category back into balance. How will this be achieved? It will be achieved by limiting sponsorship in the preferential family category to Australian citizens, by saying that people must have publicly made a commitment to Australia by becoming citizens. At a time when the size of the migration program has been reduced but demand for places is still high, the government believes people who have made a commitment to Australia should be given some priority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will be achieved in part by making changes to assurance of support. This will act in tandem with the decision to increase to two years the waiting time before migrants can access certain social security benefits&mdash;or at least this would have been the case had not <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8091"> the ALP, with the complicity of the Democrats, prevented us from doing so in the Senate last week. These were designed to send a clear message to the people who sponsor relatives and other migrants coming to Australia that they must take some responsibility for their care and support. It would have also made sure that Australian taxpayers do not bear the full brunt of the cost of support for new migrants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, the government is also taking steps in relation to sham marriages and bogus de facto relationships. The amendments the government seeks provide the power to make regulations that a prospective migrant who applies for a permanent visa on the basis of his or her de facto relationship with an Australian citizen or lawful permanent resident must satisfy a cohabitation requirement before he or she is granted a permanent visa&mdash;a very reasonable requirement. This amendment is something the coalition said during the election campaign it would be seeking if it won office. Perhaps the fact that people are prepared to lie and rort the system in order to come to Australia is a reflection on the quality of life that we as Australians all enjoy. Whether it is or is not, systemic fraud is not a practice or character trait that we should either encourage or allow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former government brought in their own measures to combat the problem of sham marriages and non&hyphen;genuine de facto relationships. The immigration minister recently said on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What we are seeking to do is to require a de facto partner to have lived at least for a period of time, say two years is what we were suggesting in our draft proposals, so that you at least know that it is a continuing relationship before they seek to enter Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>The minister said later in the interview that people in a married or de facto relationship would only get temporary residency rather than permanent residency after a successful spouse entry into Australia. If the relationship breaks down in that two&hyphen;year period, then the partner would be reasonably expected to leave Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before concluding, I would like to reiterate a couple of points. The main point is that the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> opposition and minor parties just should not continue to block measures to bring order back to Australia's migration program. Do not sabotage our solution. Do not get in the way of our attempt to deliver a planned, orderly and balanced migration program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government of the day should have the right to determine the size and balance of that program. We should be able to determine that sponsors in the preferential family category be Australian citizens. We should be allowed to let refugees bring their immediate families into Australia under the humanitarian program. We should be allowed to recoup the full costs of English language tuition to wealthy migrants. And we should be allowed to extend to two years the waiting period before new migrants can access certain social security benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not as though the coalition hid these measures from the people of Australia prior to the March election. The sooner the opposition and the minor parties realise this, the sooner we can get on with the job of introducing measures which will bring our migration program back under control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I went into the last election with a commitment to do everything I can to enhance employment prospects in my electorate. I have since spent a lot of time mediating and facilitating meetings for Korea Zinc. I have done this because the Korea Zinc project will bring hundreds of jobs to the local Townsville and Thuringowa region and provide an enormous boost to the local economy and many small businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be ignorant to think that other companies in places such as South Korea are not watching Australia, Townsville and the Korea Zinc project very closely. To jeopardise those business and industry investment opportunities is nothing short of irresponsible. Townsville has worked long and hard to secure the Korea Zinc project. I, for one, am not prepared to see Korea Zinc and other job creating projects put at risk by calls for zero immigration or net zero immigration. I commend this bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australians have a right to be proud of their heritage. Over the years, we have welcomed <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8092"> many new Australians from many countries. Too many people have accepted the politically correct line that we have something to be ashamed about. Writing about Slim Dusty, who is a fine Australian, one Melbourne journalist said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Few countries have a past they are as rightly embarrassed about as we do.</PARA>
<PARA>What trendy, politically correct rubbish! People like these try to make us ashamed to be Australians, when we have everything to be proud of. This sort of thing does not build Australia; it knocks it down. There have been too many knockers in recent times. It is about time someone said something positive about Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ted Seng, who was born in Malaysia and is now Deputy Mayor of Randwick City Council in New South Wales, has come out in support of some of the things I have been saying about migration to Australia. He was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> and the Sydney suburban newspaper the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Southern Courier</EMPHASIS>. Councillor Seng said that, although Australia had gained economic benefits from Asian migration, he did not want Australia to be `Asianised, Americanised or Africanised'. Councillor Seng said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not want to see a situation in Australia where values are dramatically changed to Asian values&mdash;that's what I'd define as Asianised.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I'm saying if Asian migrants want to come to Australia and live as they do in Asia, then why do they come here in the first place? If you are prepared to come here, you must make sacrifices.</PARA>
<PARA>What are these things that Councillor Seng values about Australia? The same things that Australians of Anglo&hyphen;Celtic and European origin value: a fair go, fighting against corruption and community spirit. Along with these goes a commitment to Judaeo-Christian values and ethics, an honest system of justice and government, and education based on English law. Councillor Seng said that Australia should stay as it has always been: a free country with a fair go for everyone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is a uniquely tolerant society. Most Australians do not care where you come from as long as you fit in and act like an Australian. This includes learning Australia's <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> common language, English. Governments continue to promote ethnic separatism in our country: for example, by allowing migrants to obtain driver's licences in their mother tongue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">New Zealand has also been debating what the future of migration should be. They have decided that learning English should have a high priority because it is important to have a stable, cohesive society as well as one that is economically strong. It is no good having a rich country if it is falling apart because of violence, gang warfare and ethnic separatism. We do not want little ethnic islands separated from the rest of the Australian community. We do want migrants who can integrate into Australian society, not congregate in just a few areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is happening in countries similar to ours? In New Zealand migrants must learn to speak English. Migrants who go there in certain categories must put up a bond of $20,000 for every person in the family over 16. The main applicant must speak English well enough to pass a test and his family must learn enough English within a year to pass a similar test. If they do not, they lose their $20,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are not mickey mouse tests. These migrants have to pass a test run by Cambridge University in England and pass it well enough to at least make themselves understood in English. These tests, called the IELTS, are an internationally recognised way to test ability in English, both spoken and written. If migrants to New Zealand fail these English tests, they lose money&mdash;a lot of money. Canada is also considering using IELTS to test their migrants in English skills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia really does not give anyone encouragement to learn English. We give free English lessons without any penalty for not learning, and without any real reward for learning to speak English properly. We give migrants up to 510 hours of free English instruction without any penalty or any reward for passing or failing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some people have said that I am a racist. This is rubbish. I am not a racist; I am a realist. I want a fair go for all Australians, no <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8093"> matter where they or their parents come from. All I want is an Australia for Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australians have been too easy going for far too long. No&hyphen;one has a god&hyphen;given right to come here. It is Australia's right to let in people who it thinks will help us grow as a nation. Migrants who come here must be prepared to fit in, as have generations of Australians who came before them. I and many other Australians are not prepared to have migrants come here to our country and start changing our culture and way of life because it offends them&mdash;for example, not being able to sing Christmas carols and hymns in some of our schools.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you. I want to see a drastic reduction in overseas aid. Charity begins at home. If Australians want to help people in need overseas, they can donate to one of many overseas aid organisations. It is not the government's job to dole out the taxpayers' dollars in charity to foreigners, many of whom do not appreciate that the people who are paying for it are the Australian taxpayers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I am allowed to decide who can come into my home, we Australians should be allowed to decide who can come and live in our country. Migrant crime gangs have flourished over the last 20 years, with drugs and money laundering, something we rarely used to hear about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The New South Wales Police Commissioner, Peter Ryan, recently arrived from Britain, was only pointing out the obvious when he said that New South Wales crime is horrific with strong links to ethnic groups. Of course, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the professional multiculturalists, both Labor and Liberal, do not want this said, even though it is common knowledge. Mr Ryan evidently has not learned yet that people in positions of power are not supposed to tell the truth about such things in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The present situation is just not good enough. Criminals convicted of serious crimes should be deported if not Australian citizens and, if they are, there should be harsher penalties to deter this sort of crime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the last 10 years, 40 per cent of all migrants coming here have been Asians. I am not against Asians coming to Australia in reasonable numbers but if the increase in Asian immigration keeps going up at the rate it has been lately in 50 years there will be more Asians than Anglo&hyphen;Celtic European Australians here. The current situation cannot be allowed to continue. The social engineering of recent years must cease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want Australia to be seen as providing an automatic sanctuary for refugees regardless of where they come from or how they are going to fit into Australian society. It is simply silly to provide for refugees and then pay for them to sue us for compensation for detaining them. No wonder we are the laughing stock of Asia. We must make sure that refugees, in particular, leave their squabbles and feuds at home. The major Asian nations must accept responsibility for Asian refugees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like Councillor Seng, many Asian migrants respect our Australian values. They speak English. They understand how our legal system works. They want the same things for their kids as other Australians&mdash;a fair go, a good education and a chance to improve themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sir Arvi Parbo is one of the finest examples of what Australia is all about. At the end of World War II we let many European refugees come here. Sir Arvi started work as an underground miner and rose to be chairman of Australia's biggest company, BHP. He is now chairman of Western Mining, one of Australia's biggest mining companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Sir Arvi Parbo came to Australia, new settlers could come here as long as they <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8094"> agreed to work in the outback and on development projects. The Snowy Mountains scheme was built by migrants and refugees. Sir Arvi has said that this is a good way to get new migrants to help develop Australia. If the bush was good enough for Sir Arvi Parbo, being the place where he started his contribution to Australia, why is it not good enough for today's migrants?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not so long ago that state education departments made students on bursaries teach in the bush, or anywhere they were sent, until they had paid off their bond. We in Australia should not discriminate on the grounds of race, and by that I mean that everyone should get a fair go.</PARA>

People often talk about their rights, but what about their responsibilities to Australia?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is silly to talk about rights without talking about responsibilities. No-one should get a free ride. People who get something from Australia should be prepared to give something back. Australian citizenship is a great privilege and we have a right to expect more from citizenship than staying here for two years and then mumbling a few words. This is why I moved a bill to tighten up the oath of allegiance to Australia by prospective citizens, but I was supported by only one other member of this House, the member for Moore (Mr Filing). So I ask: where is the concern that should be shown by other members to ensure that migrants are prepared to give this country their undivided loyalty?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Citizenship means something to most new Australians. It should mean something to all Australians, new and old. It is time we stopped seeing Australian citizenship as a gift we dole out to anyone who wants it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Treasury has released an extended version of the ABS series on public sector financial assets and liabilities. This series sheds new critical light on the Commonwealth financial management under the Hawke-Keating Labor governments. Between 1983 and 1996, during 13 years of Labor mismanagement, Commonwealth government debt rose from $9.7 billion to $93 billion. This is a rise of 860 per cent in just 13 years. As a percentage of GDP, debt increased from 5.6 per cent of GDP to 19.1 per cent of GDP. A conclusion drawn by Treasury is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite fiscal consolidation of the late 1980s, sustained deficits since 1991 have resulted in the current level of net debt as a percentage of GDP being significantly higher than at any time during the past 25 years.</PARA>
<PARA>Treasury have advised the government that, if the budget deficits were left unchecked, government debt would have blown to nearly $120 billion by the year 2000. This would have been an increase of 1,140 per cent in just 17 years or 600 per cent in the decade of the 1990s. As Treasury made clear, and I quote again:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">High or rapidly increasing debt levels may raise questions about vulnerability to economic shocks, the sustainability of policy settings and the scope to use fiscal policy for stabilisation purposes.</PARA>
<PARA>This government does not want to leave the country vulnerable to economic shocks. We did not create the problem, but we are determined to fix it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of the government's debt reduction strategy, we have already seen a significant reduction in interest rates. Small business and families are the direct beneficiaries of cuts in official interest rates from 7.5 per cent to 6.5 per cent and a fall in the variable mortgage rates from 10.5 per cent to 8.75 per <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8097"> cent. Average mortgage payments are now $145 per month less than they were before the March election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party left a fiscal mess in its wake but, as the new government attempts to pick up the shattered pieces, who is standing in the way? Who is blocking responsible fiscal policy in the Senate? Who is trying to continue a policy of fiscal abuse, of bankcard mismanagement? The Labor Party. Not only did it cause the problem, but it is trying to stop the government from fixing it. There is no justification for this fiscal vandalism. The Labor Party should hang its head in shame for deliberately hindering the government's attempts to clean up the mess that it left behind.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

Is the Prime Minister aware that rural domestic users of Telstra services, under section 183 of the Telecommunications Act, pay whatever price for a local call that consumers in Sydney are charged? Now that Telstra is likely to be partly privatised, will he ensure that a specific provision is included in the government's legislation to allow the Minister for Communications and the Arts to continue to be able to direct Telstra? Will he also ensure that a provision such as section 183 in the current act is included in the new act? Will he also <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> guarantee that the relative position of subscribers in the bush will be maintained?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BT4">Dr KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Wide Bay for his question. The major reforms to assistance for unemployed people, which were detailed by the government today, will ensure that unemployed people get help which meets their needs and which greatly increases the chance of a real job outcome. It is now becoming clear that Labor's claims about successful outcomes from Working Nation were totally misleading and, in many cases, quite false. Labor claimed that successful outcomes from labour market program providers were being achieved, even though it was the case that up to 100 per cent of clients were still on government benefits at the end of the program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They claimed that many clients were getting real jobs, but the reality was that many&mdash;if <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8099"> not most&mdash;of the people in these jobs were still on government benefits. Labor's idea of success is very different from the idea of success that most Australian people have. On their idea of success, you could probably say that the member for Holt knows something about the economy, and everyone knows that is completely false; or you might say that the member for Batman was a successful trade union leader, and everyone knows that is false; or you might say that the Labor Party is still relevant, and everybody knows that is false.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me just give some examples. In the case of jobtrain, claims were made that the majority of those going into unsubsidised jobs from certain projects were still on government benefits. In the new work opportunities program&mdash;on which the $2 billion man over there squandered $500 million before the election in an effort solely to manipulate the statistics&mdash;there were cases of new work opportunities projects where no-one came off government benefits at all. In many cases, more than 90 per cent of those involved in Skillshare programs remained on government benefits at the end.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For many providers, it was zero outcomes, zero performance. Of course, that is just like the Labor Party, isn't it? That is your performance: zero outcomes and zero performance. This was the party that Professor Ann Harding revealed reduced the real after-tax incomes of the middle 40 per cent of Australians by $11 a week on average over 11 years of their time in government&mdash;zero performance. The major reason why these very poor outcomes were being achieved was that many of these unsubsidised job outcomes related to part-time work. For example, the Labor Party claimed that 34 per cent of people on jobtrain projects were achieving outcomes but, when you look closely at the figures, you find that only 14 per cent of these were in full-time jobs and 20 per cent of them were in part-time jobs. Of course, the remaining 66 per cent did not even achieve a successful outcome on Labor's own claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key measure of outcomes under the intensive employment assistance measures which the government has announced will be <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> measured to the extent that they reduce an individual's reliance on income support payments. Primary outcome payments to the employment placement enterprises under the government's reforms will be based on placing job seekers into work&mdash;that includes apprenticeships and traineeships&mdash;which results in the total cessation of income support payments, excluding family and related payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is time that the Labor Party gives some thought to some measures for real outcomes for next year. How far does their ambitions extend for next year in terms of their own real outcomes? Perhaps some sensible comments on the economy would be in order. Do you think they might achieve a constructive policy on something? Maybe they will achieve a new leader. That would be a successful outcome in the eyes of the member for Hotham there. I have no doubt that the Australian people next year will be able to contrast the failure of the Labor Party under its Working Nation programs with the historic reforms of the government, which will reward people for helping unemployed people into real jobs.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the consequences of the government's success in economic management and the lowering of interest rates as a consequence is that deeming rates in relation to pensioners have become <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> out&hyphen;of&hyphen;kilter with market rates. For that reason, on 5 December 1996 the government announced that the rate used to assess income from the first $30,000 of a single customer's financial investment had dropped from five per cent to four per cent and the rate used to assess the balance over these amounts would drop from seven per cent to six per cent. For pensioner couples, the threshold is $50,000. For the first $50,000, the new deeming rate will be four per cent and the balance will be six per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For older Australians who currently receive less than the full rate of pension or allowance, the change may mean an increase in pension or allowance payments from 23 January 1997. It also means that those who have financial assets will now be permitted to have higher financial assets and still receive the full pension. Single pensioners will be able to have financial assets of $52,500 rather than $45,000, and pensioner couples will be able to have financial assets up to $91,200 rather than $78,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are dramatic improvements for pensioners. A reduction in the deeming rate gives them the entitlement to a pension that otherwise may have been denied to them. This is a matter of equity and justice for pensioners&mdash;equity and justice delivered by the coalition government in relation to deeming rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have said this before. You can tell that one sector of the Australian public is dramatically concerned about lower interest rates and it is an ever&hyphen;decreasing one&mdash;it is the Australian Labor Party. One never sees people with longer faces. Every time interest rates fall, the Australian Labor Party have paroxysms of upset because they just cannot bear to think that this is a government that has delivered benefits to home buyers, delivered benefits to small business, delivered benefits in relation to credit cards, because it has been able to put in place fiscal policy and a low inflation environment against every whit of opposition that the demoralised Labor Party could possibly dream up. We have not forgotten about those people who would have been otherwise adversely affected, and that is why we have changed the deeming rates.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8101">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me make one last point in relation to a low inflation environment. There will be many self&hyphen;funded retirees who feel that low inflation or lower interest rates means that they have to eat into capital rather than income on their capital in their retirement. But I would point out that a low inflation rate protects the capital value of a retiree's investments. On a 10 per cent inflation rate, the real value of a capital sum of money erodes by half in less than eight years. On a two per cent inflation rate, the real value of capital would only erode by half over a period of 35 years. The best protection for savers, and people who rely on savings, is a low inflation environment backed up with low deeming rates to ensure fairness and equity to those people who rely on pensions.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Groom for his question. This question could not have come from a more appropriate member than the member for Groom, as he is the first ever chairman of the parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Treaties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true, as suggested in the honourable member's question, that this government made an historic change to the way treaties are made by the Australian government. On 2 May this year, I announced a package of reforms which included increased parliamentary scrutiny of treaty actions prior to Australia binding those treaty actions, adequate consultation with interested parties, a proposed treaty action and an increased level of information on treaty making being disseminated to the wider community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Seven months after this historic new system was put in place, I can report to the House that our aims so far have been met. All treaty actions are now tabled in both houses for at <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8103"> least 15 sitting days prior to binding treaty action being taken by the government, unless there are exceptional circumstances of urgency, and all treaty actions are tabled with a national interest analysis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me also remind the House that in June the COAG meeting agreed to the formation of a new treaties council. Finally, in June of this year, the first ever parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Treaties was formed. As I mentioned earlier, it is ably chaired by the member for Groom. Members of that committee from both sides of the House have performed with great enthusiasm, showing a great deal of interest. It just confirms my view that this has been a very important and a very valuable initiative by the Howard government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee has tabled four reports to date, three in relation to treaty actions tabled under the new system and one report on the committee's inquiry into a bilateral agreement with Japan on long&hyphen;line tuna fishing. Fifty&hyphen;one treaty actions have been tabled under the new procedures, and it is now possible for Australians interested in treaty making to obtain the latest information on the Internet by checking my department's home page.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, these are historic changes to the treaty making process and they have one other very great additional advantage: they give the public confidence in the treaty making process by making it transparent and subject to scrutiny. I think that is a very important component of advancing the cause of our international relations.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AJ4">Mr SHARP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Wakefield for his question. He is very interested, as are many people on this side of the House, in the future of rail. Since the announcement by this government of its new rail reforms there has been considerable interest from the private sector in investing in rail freight in Australia and putting more freight from the roads onto rail as a consequence of the government's rail reform initiatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was very pleased yesterday to hear TNT, one of Australia's largest transport companies, announce a joint venture with Toll Holdings, one of Australia's largest freight forwarders. They announced they would run a joint venture putting freight onto the rail system, which will effectively double the amount of freight they are operating on the east&hyphen;west corridor between Melbourne and Perth and ultimately between Sydney and Perth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government welcomes the announcement because it fulfils one of the ambitions this government has in terms of its rail reforms&mdash;that is, to put more freight onto the rail system, rather than what was happening after the last 13 years of the previous Labor government, which saw freight go off the rail system onto the roads. So this initiative announced yesterday is very welcome indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note the comments of Mr David Mortimer, the Chief Executive Officer of TNT, who said that this initiative, with the support provided by the federal government through its rail reforms, would lead to more freight going on rail from road. It was also pleasing to note the comments of Mr Paul Little, the Managing Director of Toll Holdings, that this initiative to form a joint venture to run their own trains has come about as a result of a lack of satisfactory service provided by the rail operators in Australia under the previous government's policies. So this initiative that they have announced will lead to the fulfilment of the ambition of this government to see more <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8105"> freight going onto our rail system rather than the other way around.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After 13 years of a Labor government, we saw some 8,000 jobs go from the rail company that the Commonwealth owns, the Australian National Railways Commission. We saw rail losing more and more of its market share in terms of the transport tasks for Australia. But now, with the announcements by the government, not only will that start to turn around, but this initiative that we have announced will lead to more jobs being created in the rail sector, there will be more freight going onto the rail system rather than the other way around, and this will lead to more opportunities for regional Australia, as transport services are made more competitive and more reliable. Also, the taxpayers of Australia will not have to put good money after bad into our rail companies, such as AN, which lost $250 million in the last 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This announcement by TNT and Toll yesterday is living proof of the fact that the former Labor government's policies were a failure in terms of trying to promote rail in Australia and the new coalition government's policies are a success in promoting rail freight as a viable, competitive and reliable form of transport to service Australian industry.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

In relation to part B of the family tax initiative, that is, where one of the children is under five and where it is a single income family, the increase in the tax&hyphen;free threshold is $2,500 or the benefit is $19.20 per fortnight.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I say to the honourable member that Dr Hocking's findings are limited and are inconclusive at this stage. They were discussed at an international seminar in Europe just two weeks ago, when all the evidence on studies like this was discussed. It was the consensus at that stage that it was still far too early for research to show any sort of causation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are three different types of towers: firstly, television towers, to which the honourable member refers; secondly, telecommunications towers; and, thirdly, mobile telephone towers. According to Dr Hocking, the telecommunications towers emit a pencil beam and as such they are quite different to the other two and are of no concern. This is of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> some reassurance to me because I have one of these major towers in my electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to television towers and mobile telephone towers, the two, whilst similar, are not the same. They emit quite a different frequency of radio wave. You cannot assume that anything, even if it were proven in relation to one, would apply to the other. So we are actually talking about television towers, not mobile telephone towers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Back in October, the Minister for Communications and the Arts and I announced that we had set up an expert committee, again arising out of Dr Hocking's work. It comprises experts in health, science and communications. We do need to take this very seriously, but it is something that is going to take a number of years before we can get any sort of conclusive evidence. We have committed $4&half; million for further research over the next five years. It will be looked after under the National Health and Medical Research Council.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to the honourable member that one of the things that makes this difficult is that we are talking about a type of childhood leukaemia called acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. This is a leukaemia that appears in clusters. We do not know why it appears in clusters more frequently than can be explained by chance. I had a cousin in Emerald in Queensland who died from one of these clusters some 10 years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no evidence that it is the television towers that are responsible. It is very hard for parents to gauge any sort of relative risk. I say to the honourable member that the kids of the parents in his electorate are at far greater risk from not being properly immunised, they are at far greater risk of drowning in a swimming pool that does not have a proper fence and they are at far greater risk of dying in a motor vehicle accident because they are not properly restrained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there is an increased risk of childhood leukaemia, which is in itself a very rare occurrence, the increased risk is in itself still a very rare occurrence. I hope that this association does not turn out to be a causation. There is no evidence whatsoever that it is a causation at the moment. We are doing <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8107"> everything we can on the best available scientific evidence. While I do understand the concern, people should try to understand the relative risk. If they are actually worried, there is an awful lot of simple things they can do to protect their kids from the things that are a far greater risk to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As soon as we have any evidence on this from the research, we will let people know. But I do think it will be some time before we get it. Up until then, I can only say that an association does not imply causation. With something like acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, we have to be very careful because it does occur in clusters.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of the specific evidence that you put and your reliance on the existence of the Western Australian agreements stream, I would like to see exactly what your evidence is.

What we have tried to do with this Natural Heritage Trust is put in place a fund that will deal with many of the matters that she would be concerned about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was an election commitment of the government and, as the Prime Minister pointed out earlier, this is the second part of a twin approach. We are trying to see that enhanced competition and the development of part privately owned telecommunications will take Australia screaming into the information age, into the next century, and will also provide a benefit to the areas the member is concerned about. Moreton Bay, in the southern part of your electorate as I understand, does have concerns, particularly in the wetlands area, about the increasing provision of tourism developments; marine pollution, particularly from stormwater run&hyphen;off, which I have spoken about in this House before; and urban sprawl.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Natural Heritage Trust creates some categories of funding. One particular area of interest to the member is the coast and clean seas initiative. One hundred million dollars have been marked for attention to that area by Senator Hill, the Minister for the Environment. The proposal is to increase coastal planning to involve communities in designing new measures to address major pollution concerns in coastal areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I mentioned, in the area represented by the member are the wetlands. They serve a very important function ecologically. They act, in a sense, as the lungs of Brisbane. The wetlands offer an attractive lifestyle in the region, but they also serve an extremely important biological purpose.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, my question is addressed to you. I refer to the lengthy divisions of last night and of recent times, and remind you that a recently tabled Procedure Committee report on the conduct of divisions contained a dissenting report recommending the urgent installation of electronic voting in this chamber. I also remind you in passing that your predecessor tabled a detailed report on electronic voting in 1993. Will you instruct the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff to conduct an update of that report with respect to the latest technology that is available and also the potential costs associated with the installation of electronic voting with a view to reporting to this House by February 1997?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, on indulgence, and also on that matter, for the information of members in respect of the government's response to the Procedure Committee report, we are having an informal meeting this afternoon with a number of members, I think including the member for Cunningham, to look at all of the matters within that report. Obviously there are some who are keen on electronic voting, but the report also canvas <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8109"> ses a series of other options which are much less costly and which could be much more easily introduced. We will be looking at that in a sensible way. My view is that, if there is agreement amongst members to introduce such a scheme&mdash;leaving aside electronic voting but introducing new forms&mdash;provided that there is a cooperative attitude towards it, perhaps a trial may well be appropriate, and we would certainly look at that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that we can reduce the time involved in the conduct of divisions and that that would be in everybody's interests, but my view is that it needs to be done on a cooperative basis. Obviously, Mr Speaker, I would have to say that my personal view is that I do not see our spending a lot of money on electronic voting as a high priority.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On indulgence, Mr Speaker: as to that last issue of costing, the purpose of my question to you was to see whether or not the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff might conduct a new inquiry into the latest technology and the costs associated with it. I believe that since 1993 the costs have probably come down significantly, as many parliaments around the world have now installed this equipment, and I ask that that be taken into consideration by you as part of this process which we are going through with the Leader of the House.</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

It is related to the question that was raised by the member for Cunningham and refers to that awkward situation which arose last night when, after the tellers were appointed, there were two members in the House who, presumably, should have voted and chose not to. In the circumstances which prevailed last night, it did not matter very much because the outcome of that vote was very positive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do put to you, though, Mr Speaker, the situation where perhaps the numbers are more evenly balanced. For example, in a vote of the kind that was taken last night, if the majority&mdash;those who were successful in casting their vote&mdash;had been only one, what position would that have placed the chamber in in having the question resolved when the votes which should have been recorded by two of its members were not recorded? As I say, last night it did not matter because of the numbers. But could you later advise the House how a situation of that kind would be resolved?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> reaffirms the strong commitment of the Australian Parliament and the Australian people to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights with its fundamental principle that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights; they are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of common humanity, without distinction of any kind such as race, colour, sex, language, religion or birth;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> reiterates the bipartisan support given since 1948 by all Australian governments to international recognition and enhancement of the principle that human rights are universal and indivisible, and that everybody has the right to life, liberty, the security of person, freedom of thought, expression and religion;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> deplores the appalling violation of human rights which threatens life and security, recognising that slavery, ethnic cleansing, torture, racial and religious discrimination, and the arbitrary deprivation of liberty, are still widespread throughout the world; and</PARA>

<PARA>I would like to say a very few words in support of this motion. I imagine it is a motion that will enjoy the unanimous support of the parliament. It does express views which I believe all members of this parliament hold in common. It does make certain fundamental assumptions about the kind of people we are. It does call attention to the need for practical gestures, as well as rhetoric, on the part of governments. It does refer in a very sweeping way to the need for all governments, and in particular for the Australian government and all members of this parliament, to treat with great respect and equal dignity and to accord equal treatment to all Australians, whether they were born in this country or whether they have immigrated to Australia and irrespective of their race, their colour, their sex, their religion, their nationality or their place of birth.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is also important&mdash;and I am encouraged to interpolate this observation and I may not have done so had it not been for the interjection of the member for Denison&mdash;that one of the aspirations contained in this motion is the desire that everybody have the right to life, liberty, the security of the person, and freedom of thought, expression and religion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is fair to say that over the past 12 months the greatest blow that has been struck in favour of one of those aspirations&mdash;namely, the security of the person&mdash;was the decision taken by the government, the opposition and all of the other governments of Australia to have strong national gun laws. It is all very well to make noble speeches about human rights. It is all very well to say how much you believe  in anti&hyphen;discrimination legislation. It is all very well to run around saying, `I believe in the liberty of the individual and I believe in an anti&hyphen;discriminatory society.' But, if you cannot provide basic physical security to your citizens, you are failing a very important test of upholding human rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Security of the person is one of the most important of all human rights. What has been done in this country over the past 12 months in the area of gun laws has struck a greater <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8111"> blow for human rights in this country than any other measure or any other speech that has been undertaken or made over the last 12 months. It has provided a measure of comfort and an assurance of physical security which, whilst not perfect and whilst not fail safe, was absent in the past. It is something that will make Australia a fine example to the rest of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many people in this country when they talk about human rights and when they talk about discrimination and tolerance are very fond of apologising for Australia. I am not one of those. I think Australia has an outstanding human rights record. I think we are an outstandingly tolerant people. I think one of our great characteristics is that we have welcomed millions of people from all around the world. By and large, they are treated with great dignity, great decency and great respect by the great majority of Australians, and I hope that always continues to be the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can certainly say on behalf of this government that it is committed 100 per cent to all of the principles that are enshrined in this motion. It is a motion that brings together the common assent of all members of the Australian parliament to some fundamental human values, and I very warmly commend the terms of this motion to the parliament.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I support the motion before the House. It is the second occasion on which we have had to deliberate&mdash;not `had to', that puts it too negatively; on which we have been able to deliberate&mdash;on a matter that deals with human rights in this nation in very recent times. It is the third if you include the gun laws issue, and I do agree with the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in his sentiments on that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second occasion, if you incorporate that issue, was the statement that this House passed on the issue of race relations. We passed that because the issue of human rights in this nation, though we identify strongly with a set of democratic principles and with a need for tolerance in our society, is not a matter that does not have to be argued in our community. That means that the content of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> those propositions will always be an issue of debate in our societies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will always be tests presented to us. We will come through those tests better than just about anyone else in the world but the tests will nevertheless be there. The fact that those tests are there means that governments and parliaments in particular&mdash;this is what we are doing here&mdash;need to keep their commitments fresh and, in keeping their commitments fresh, need to reflect on the fact that there are often opportunities for mischief which ought to be avoided. In so doing, ensuring a strong bipartisan support for the rights of all our citizens is the best chance for us to have the sort of united society we desperately need to continue to enjoy if we are to survive in the world in which we live.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will be a tough issue, a tough question, for this nation of some 20 million people in the region around us to survive as the years go by in a state in which we have the sort of society that we all have come to grow up with, approve of, appreciate and fight for, as many of our generations have. Therefore, there is quite a burden on all of us in parliaments around the country to uphold those rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">International Human Rights Day celebrates the anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in the United Nations on 10 December 1948. Speaking on that day, the great jurist and statesman Bert Evatt&mdash;wouldn't it have been so much better to have had the `Gareth Evans Drive' and the `Bert Evatt Building', but we will set that aside for a later day&mdash;declared:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The adoption of the declaration is a step forward in a great evolutionary process, the first occasion on which the organised community of nations has made a declaration of human rights and fundamental freedoms. That document is backed by the authority of the body of opinion of the United Nations as a whole and millions of people&mdash;men, women and children&mdash;all over the world who would turn to it for help, guidance and inspiration.</PARA>
<PARA>In 1966 that universal declaration was joined by two more covenants&mdash;one on civil and political rights and the other on economic, social and cultural rights&mdash;to form what is often called the international bill of rights. Many conventions have followed since then, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8112"> on the elimination of racial discrimination, the elimination of discrimination against women, and a convention against torture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decades since the end of the Second World War, and formed by the two great wars this century&mdash;the only two total wars&mdash;have seen human rights elevated into the global agenda and international relations. This has been a great victory for the idea of the rights of the individual. Human rights now vie for attention on an agenda previously preoccupied by the simple calculation and use of military power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's record in advancing the cause of human rights internationally is a very proud one. As the motion states, all Australian governments since 1948 have supported the principle of universal and indivisible human rights. Human rights issues present a substantial challenge for Australian foreign policy in the region. As our regional neighbours grapple with their human rights issues, the challenge for Australia is to develop a consistent and appropriate response both for the region and befitting Australian values and concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this context I want to point to a couple of developments in the region&mdash;a couple of statements as much as developments&mdash;which I think offer great hope for the universality of the sorts of rights that we are dealing with. Sometimes a bogus proposition is put before us that there are distinctive types of rights or attitudes, rights that are different from culture to culture, and there is no universal element to them. There is an argument amongst some of the governments in the region around us that this happens to be the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there is also a contrary position expressed, and I was moved to read a recent speech by the Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister, Anwar Ibrahim, on precisely this matter. I do not know the extent to which the speech attracted publicity in his own country, but it was an extraordinarily articulate expression of the universal questions that are involved in these declarations. I will quote one or two passages from it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we in Asia want to speak credibly of Asian values, we too must be prepared to champion those ideals which are universal and which belong to humanity as a whole. It is altogether shameful, if <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ingenious, to cite Asian values as an excuse for autocratic practices and denial of basic rights and civil liberties. To say that freedom is western or unAsian is to offend our own traditions as well as our forefathers who gave their lives in the struggle against tyranny and injustices. . . it is certainly wrong to regard society as a kind of false god upon whose altar the individual must constantly be sacrificed. No Asian tradition can be cited to support the proposition that in Asia the individual must melt into the faceless community.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>The rest of his speech was somewhat along those lines, so those were two golden passages from it. The affirmation that there is not a so-called Western interpretation of universal human rights from one of the most influential regional politicians is a very important and very helpful development and ought to be recognised on this day in this country and in this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are other developments in this regard too. I have been impressed in recent times by the efforts of the human rights commission in Indonesia. It was established by the government but, in the reports that have been put forward by it subsequently, very obviously operates at arms length. From time to time, official handling of political demonstrations and other activities have attracted the unfavourable attention of and public exposure by their human rights commission. The fact that that is so well accepted&mdash;that gradually incorporated within the political structure of our nearest neighbour is an ongoing analysis of their society's performance against a set of tests which are essentially universal in application&mdash;is a very important development in the area and it ought to be acknowledged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no area or sensitive concern that this human rights commission will not go into. Indeed, I understand it has just opened an office in Timor. These are two developments which I would draw attention to, including the statement by Anwar Ibrahim&mdash;there are many others as well&mdash;because we are discussing values which we believe to be universal in the statements that are made here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been one or two initiatives in the area of human rights which this government has related to, and I would caution the government against the direction in which it has gone. I acknowledge the point the Prime <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8113"> Minister makes: obviously your right to life, your capacity to survive, is quite clearly the most fundamental of political and human rights. The ability to live in a society free from the thought that, if you go into any public place, you stand a reasonable chance of being shot is quite clearly an important development. The fact that we are able to protect the community from that is a very important thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are one or two other areas, however, where I do not think the government has done itself the credit that it ought to&mdash;and it ought to use this particular day to reflect upon those. The first that I would identify is our reluctance to enter into an agreement with the EEU, not simply on the basis of a reasonable argument over whether or not agricultural protection elements of it are things that we want to sign up to, or wish to press them on further, but a declaration in those agreements. They do not actually have to sign agreements with us. From their point of view, they make it amply clear to us&mdash;whatever we might think about them; we are perfectly expendable on these agreements&mdash;that we have chosen to challenge them not simply on areas where we were debating with them the content of that particular agreement&mdash;reasonable commercial issues&mdash;but also on an area where we were not holding a debate with them, signing up to the human rights clause in their agreements, which they have put automatically to every country that they effectively do business with. I would draw attention to the sentiments expressed by Dagmar Roth&hyphen;Behrendt, a member of the European parliament, who said last week when questioned as to the Australian attitude on this human rights issue:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Really, I have to say we don't need the agreement necessarily. If they don't want to sign it they should not sign it because the first time that I ever thought about problems with human rights in Australia was now when I heard that the Australians don't like this clause in the framework agreement.</PARA>
<PARA>They did not care particularly much whether we chose to go down that road or not. Whatever else you do with the Europeans&mdash;and by all means twist their arms up behind their backs on the subject of their agricultural protection; it is very important that we do <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this&mdash;we should not compromise our stand by putting forward what seems to them such outlandish views on a set of principles which we have absolutely no trouble signing up to, I would have thought; in fact, signing up to what is precisely here in this motion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second area relates to the ILO. We have taken a stance in which we have argued with the Americans that on the position they are putting forward, that before they consider or whilst they are considering trade matters, they may wish to consider the rights of workers and the rights of children not to be enslaved and other general human rights and environmental matters&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would also like to say a few words on the motion introduced by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). It is important that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8114"> people remember that, in the heady euphoria at the end of World War II, when the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the charter which constituted the United Nations was set down, it was the aftermath of a great deal of trauma, personal distress and very considerable suffering. There is little doubt that today the world has changed. Yet, 51 years on, in many countries the same trauma and suffering that existed in those war&hyphen;torn days regrettably are still with us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we are looking at International Human Rights Day we would do well to look both inwards and outwards. We should look inwards at ourselves and our country and the extent to which, within our own country, there are those who are less well off. While it is true that few suffer to the degree that they did during the days of the Great Depression, sadly there are still those who are short of food, clothing and shelter. There are those who do suffer. As one who comes from the country, I know how many people were forced to very significantly reduce their standards of living during the rural recession. It is to combat those very reductions in their standard of living that we on the government side of the House seek to provide policies to ensure that these problems are addressed and to provide opportunity and hope for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, we need to realise that there are other aspects of the debate within Australia that are equally important. I am one of those who condemns the prejudice that has emerged from the statements by the honourable member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). I believe that racial tolerance and the recognition of the rights of individuals&mdash;whatever their background, whatever their colour, whatever their creed&mdash;are an essential part of the status of being an Australian. We would do well, on a day like today when we recognise International Human Rights Day, to practise those basic precepts in our own society as much as we would impose them on others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we are looking at the motion, we would do well to look at the world around us. In so doing, I want to pay particular tribute to Maree Worthington, the Red Cross nurse held hostage for five weeks by Sudanese rebels. I <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> do not know her, but I understand she comes from Toongabbie&mdash;an Australian working with the International Red Cross. Apparently, having been captured, she treated the children of one of her captors. She was offered to be released but stayed with the two other captives until they could all be released. In so doing, she showed remarkable courage. On a day like today, we would do well to praise her&mdash;to recognise her bravery and her self&hyphen;sacrifice. At the same time, we say to all those others who served in government and non-government organisations in peacekeeping units around the world, `We share with you in the pride of your achievement.' Regrettably, in so many other countries, the basic freedoms of food, clothing and shelter are not present.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to the violations referred to in the motion, there is no doubt that ethnic cleansing, torture and some of the prejudices that are a product of the absolute abuse of power&mdash;they still seem to be the product of too many regimes around the world&mdash;are also matters of great concern. One needs only to look at two instances in our own vicinity. In Burma, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has only just been released from house arrest. Also, we read in reports after the demonstrations in Rangoon in the last few days that there has been a crackdown on universities where there has been repression against students. Individuals there are being treated in a way which we would all condemn.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should admire Daw Aung San Suu Kyi not only for the way in which she stood up to the SLORC regime but also for the fact that she represents the basic essence of the freedoms to which we would hope, in the expression of democracy, the people of Burma might some day be able to realise. After all, she is an elected leader of the people of Burma but has been denied the capacity to take office by virtue of the intervention by the State Law and Order Restoration Council and the hierarchy that it represents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other country so close to us about which we also need to feel concerned is East Timor. There, too, regrettably, there are still unfortunate interventions by the Indonesian <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8115"> authorities which do not recognise the rights of those who are there. There, too, the precepts that are part of this motion need to be followed and recognised. Within Bougainville, which is even closer, sadly there are abuses which all of us condemn and which we would hope might be reversed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the other aspect of this motion which I want to mention is that, in paragraph 5, the Prime Minister refers to the `efforts of successive Australian governments to promote the rule of law and the spirit of democracy'. There are two ways in which this world can be changed. There is no doubt that that will occur if we can implement to a greater degree the practices that apply to the rule of law. In other words, the administration of law by impartial members of a judiciary&mdash;not part of elected officers and not part of officers exercising power in whatever way but, having been appointed, exercising power and then dispassionately fulfilling their function at arm's length from the government for the time being. Sadly, in so many countries, the practice of an independent dispassionate rule of law is not present.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same might be said, too, of the spirit of democracy. There has been notable progress but much still needs to be achieved. One would hope that the spread of democratic institutions in a true way can be advanced as a result of the improved economic conditions that are creeping into so many countries and as a result of the assistance that countries like Australia provide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is little doubt that, in the last little while, the trend towards humanitarian assistance rather than the development of foreign aid has prejudiced the extent to which countries like Australia have been able to help in the advance of human rights. On a day like this, we need to recognise the extent to which there is, universally within the Australian parliament, a commitment to the principles that were laid down in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. I would like to join in the expression of the view that those principles might be more widely accepted in the future.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to this motion on <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> International Human Rights Day, which reaffirms our support for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that was adopted on this day 48 years ago. The preamble of the UN charter sets out the noble determination of the peoples of the world `to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in equal rights of men and women' and `to promote social progress and better standards of life'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was pleased to note that the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) this day at the National Press Club picked up those very sentiments in his address. The words are very welcome, but I think it is appropriate today to note that there is much in the government's performance which falls short of the rhetoric, particularly so in regard to the fundamental human rights associated with the lives of working men, women and children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the few moments available to me today I want to especially refer to the government's policies concerning the work of the International Labour Organisation&mdash;the organisation which only this week the government has made so much of as the forum to address international labour standards, including child labour exploitation. Questions of core labour standards are issues of fundamental human rights. In the case of child labour exploitation, the need for urgent international action is overwhelming. It is a state of affairs highlighted by UNICEF's 1997 report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">State of the world's children</EMPHASIS>, which I believe the minister is going to release on Thursday of this week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although Australia has been a leading member of the ILO for more than 70 years, the government has now drastically curtailed our involvement in that organisation. Since March, the government has withdrawn from the ILO's governing body and terminated Australia's permanent representation to the ILO. It is true, of course, that we remain a financial member of the ILO, but we are no longer in a position to be a significant contributor to the work of the organisation&mdash;something that we have been down through the ages. Tragically, I point out to the House today that it appears we will no longer be a member of the ILO's working party on the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8116"> social dimensions of trade liberalisation&mdash;the very instrument that the minister identified as being the key to the ILO's attack on the exploitation of children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For good measure, the government has withdrawn Australia's funding for ILO regional programs supporting core labour standards, including programs to eliminate child labour exploitation. It is worth remembering that in the budget year 1994-95 Australia committed more than $4 million of aid towards the development of core labour standards in Asia, particularly programs to eliminate exploitative child labour. In 1995-96, the last year of our government, our commitments in this area doubled to exceed $8 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These programs included training industrial workplace organisers in the Philippines, principally women process workers, to negotiate employment conditions and to strengthen basic health and safety measures. In Malaysia, Australia assisted occupational health and safety programs, whilst in Nepal we were working with the ILO to provide rehabilitation services to bonded children and income generating activities for their families. We were also active in promoting adherence to international labour standards in China, Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These programs and others were designed to protect and to promote basic human rights in our region. They were a practical demonstration of our nation's commitment to promote all human rights, not just civil rights and political rights. I am sorry to have to point out to the House that all of these commitments have now been slashed. If the government is to perform in a way that sees reality matching the rhetoric, it is going to have to lift its performance very dramatically, and I live in hope that it will do so.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Chair of the parliament's human rights subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and Chair of the Parliamentary Amnesty International Group, I am particularly pleased to support this motion today on International Human Rights Day. As you will be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, human rights are long understood but only comparatively recently <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> defined in international law by the international bill of rights, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, plus the international covenants in 1996 on civil and political rights and on economic, social and cultural rights. Other conventions have followed, giving greater definition to internationally acceptable rights.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The standards defined in the various covenants are both broad and basic and therefore difficult to dispute: the preservation of the inherent dignity of human life, the right to life, liberty, freedom of thought and expression, and the pursuit of justice and peace. The importance of universality and indivisibility was reaffirmed at the Vienna World Conference on Human Rights in June 1993. All nations then agreed to the principles in the final declaration. Therefore, there is an international consensus that there is no cultural difference in what constitutes human rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The end of the Cold War should offer opportunities to implement human rights standards in a way that was impossible when the world was sensitive to a moral competition between two political philosophies, yet any cursory look at the state of the world would recognise a bleak prospect indeed. Fierce internal disputes of considerable savagery have broken out in most continents: Rwanda, Bosnia, Afghanistan and Sri Lanka.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More than any other issue, the international community should address the issue, it seems to me, of minority rights&mdash;the most urgent and the most vexed issue facing the United Nations and the major threat to world security. There is a need to rethink the idea of national self-determination, remove from it its secessionist tendencies and its inherent approval of national ethnic purity. It is a dangerous and divisive notion in a mobile world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moreover, governments cannot maintain national cohesion by force and the continual oppression of minorities. Effective and successful multiracial and multi&hyphen;ethnic states need to express their diversity in institutions and political structures which genuinely accommodate the aspirations of their minorities. Failure to make that accommodation&mdash;or worse, abuse and oppression of minorities&mdash;gives moral force to claims for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8117"> independence and secession. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is essential, if man is not to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that human rights should be protected by the rule of law.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>The pursuit of human rights is a matter of great importance for Australians. It is one of our defining characteristics, expressed colloquially as the `fair go' philosophy. There is broad cross-party support in the parliament for human rights principles. The human rights subcommittee in this parliament gets an enormous volume of correspondence from Australian citizens. There is considerable consensus of view expressed by people on their expectations on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> There is, and always has been, a gulf between theory and practice. Implementation is the real test of commitment. All nations, including our own, have weaknesses that must be addressed. Just as the values underpinning human rights are universal, so the human weaknesses&mdash;cruelty, tyranny, racial intolerance and war&mdash;are universal. For us, the flaws in our record are in the treatment of Aboriginal people, the homelessness amongst youth, the treatment of the mentally ill, violence against women and violence against children, which is particularly topical at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is generally well served by its legal framework, and its record overall is a laudable one. Australia genuinely tries to live up to the obligations that it has agreed to. We believe in the rule of law and the protection of the weak against the strong. Having said that, however, we should also be aware that any failure to maintain the highest standards undermines the fundamental principles upon which the nation defines itself: vigilance is ever important. I thank the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the deputy chair of the two organisations mentioned by the previous speaker, the member for Aston (Mr Nugent), I am pleased to support this motion. International Human Rights Day is an important day in the calendar because human rights are never easily achieved. They can be easily diminished, they are less easily improved, and their protection requires eternal vigilance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The processes of democracy and the protection of human rights are intricately linked. Democracy&mdash;through recurrent elections, an independent judiciary and a free press&mdash;minimises the possibility for dictatorship and allows individuals avenues for complaint and the redress of grievances. Human rights are best protected and preserved by scrutiny through the free press and the democratic institutions of parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This parliament has always been a forum for the debate on human rights. All legislation is about the balancing and the defining of rights. The Australian Parliamentary Amnesty International Group is a relatively unusual group, rare in the parliaments of the world. It keeps human rights issues, particularly relating to prisoners of conscience, before the parliament. In the domestic sphere, there is a Senate committee, the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, whose specific terms of reference are to examine all legislation to ensure that it does not offend human rights principles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Over recent years, parliament has instituted new and important mechanisms to enhance the promotion and protection of human rights. In 1991, the human rights subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade was formed. Over the last five years, it has produced reports on human rights in a wide range of areas; it has given access to community groups from all over Australia to the parliament; it has made recommendations on domestic policy frameworks on aid, trade and human rights, on peacekeeping, on children's rights, on indigenous people's rights, on women's rights and on workers' rights; and it has discussed and debated issues of principle in this country and in the region. In the process, it has increased the knowledge of the parliament about international human rights standards, and the weaknesses in policy and processes which the government has redressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The human rights subcommittee debated the role of parliament in the treaty making process in its 1994 report and found the current arrangements to be unsatisfactory. It recommended greater parliamentary involvement. This matter was subsequently examined by <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8118"> the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee. Its recommendation for a treaties committee has been implemented in this parliament. I am pleased to say the Chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, the member for Groom (Mr Taylor), is in the chamber. This is an important change and an enhancement of the role of parliament in relation to treaty making.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The inquiries that the human rights subcommittee has conducted have affirmed the universality and indivisibility of human rights and have informed members of details of situations all over the world where torture and cruelty remain prevalent. It is distressing that so many unresolved conflicts continue which devastate people's lives and destroy the prosperity of so many nations. They continue in Burma, Sri Lanka, East Timor, Bougainville, Tibet, Rwanda, the Sudan and the former Yugoslavia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee has also been reminded that, whilst Australia's record at home is good by any international standards, there are still serious unresolved problems that we must address. These include high rates of violence against women; the abuse and neglect of too many children; youth homelessness; and Aboriginal disadvantage and unemployment, leading to high rates of incarceration, deaths in custody, and poor health and housing standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are shortcomings in our performances. We do not have a national law regarding racial vilification, although some states do have such legislation. Internationally, there are issues such as child labour, which was mentioned by the honourable member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith (Mr Brereton). We should be showing the lead there; we are not. I share his concerns about the downgrading of our representation and our role in the ILO.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For a country that has a good record and has support on both sides, I am appalled that the government will not sign up to the human rights article with the European Commission relating to trade. I know it is a sophisticated argument, but we are sending out the wrong message. I am concerned too about the recent debate initiated by the honourable member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). It has done little to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> enhance Australia's image abroad concerning human rights. Again, it sends the wrong message. On International Human Rights Day, it is valuable to recall the importance of eternal vigilance and continuous monitoring at home.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is indeed an honour to speak today to this motion. It is so easy for those of us living in Australia, an island apart from the tragedies and major human rights abuses of the world, to dismiss the urgency of the need to correct those abuses. Others in this debate have alluded to the situation in Burma, where supporters of democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi are desperate for the free world to maintain intense pressure on the Burmese military regime; otherwise we will see a repeat of the bloody uprising of 1988 that left thousands either dead or in gaol. The same applies with China and its continued heavy&hyphen;handed treatment of those who would promote even the most basic of democratic reforms and which maintains a policy in Tibet that is ethnic cleansing dressed cynically as neighbourly aid.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the short time I have available, I want to concentrate on one issue of human rights. On this International Human Rights Day, I appeal to the Indonesian government to reappraise its policy on East Timor and for Australia to reappraise its acquiescent policy of over 20 years on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is too late to turn back the clock. The Portuguese abandoned their former colony and cannot legitimately claim to have any lasting commitment to the country. But most so&hyphen;called world leaders have stood aside for more than two decades, hands over eyes, and wished the Indonesians would get on with the integration of East Timor as quickly and bloodlessly as possible. It has not been so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With many thousands of East Timorese dying for their land and culture, their brave fight is recognised today at Oslo, where Bishop Belo and Jose Ramos Horta will receive this year's Nobel Peace Prize. The Indonesian mission at the United Nations has described as `ironic' the award bestowed on Horta. It has reportedly questioned how the award could be granted to `this person whose <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8119"> hands are stained with the blood of the reign of terror'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who really began this reign of terror? Any armed resistance involves bloodshed, as the Australian diggers who fought the enemy alongside their East Timorese friends during World War II know only too well. So too were our diggers stained in blood. To claim a people who have lost 200,000&mdash;a third of their number&mdash;in civil war and armed resistance were part of a `reign of terror' is to totally deny the truth of this forced integration and de&hyphen;culturalisation. For all the vast moneys and its own blood that Indonesia has spent in fighting the East Timorese resistance, it has failed to suppress a freedom force now estimated at only between 500 and 600 people. Such can be the case where right rather than might prevails.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indonesia is a very complex society of 200 million people. I noticed recently that the eminent Australian Brian Burdekin, now special human rights adviser to the United Nations, has made flattering comments about Indonesia's recent progress in human rights. Mr Burdekin stressed the collective nature of Indonesia's human rights compared to Australia's and the Western world's obsession with selfish, individual rights. He mentioned our lack of attention to the homeless, the mentally ill and the Aborigines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that Indonesia's national commission on human rights, established in 1993, is making progress in some essential areas, while we are still struggling with the health, education and housing needs of many thousands of our own original inhabitants. But that is no reason to gloss over the abuses of human rights that remain in East Timor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Pressure does work. Some Indonesian academics are now openly questioning Indonesian policies in its so&hyphen;called 27th province. There is pressure mounting for self&hyphen;determination in East Timor. I believe anything less than recognition of East Timorese cultural identity will be no justice at all. Former Prime Minister Keating said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no relationship more important to Australia than Indonesia's.</PARA>
<PARA>No relationship is worth anything if it cannot survive honest, forthright discussion on <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> perceived human rights abuses. East Timor is not about perceptions. The disappearance of East Timorese after the Santa Cruz massacre of December 1991 and the misinformation on the scale of the killings throughout this 20&hyphen;year struggle should be part of frank discussions one should have with a trusted neighbour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not to speak out on human rights abuses such as these, especially on occasions such as International Human Rights Day, is to betray our own conscience and, worse, to betray those battling racial, religious, social and economic persecution around the world who need us&mdash;perhaps the freest, most peaceful nation on earth&mdash;to take up their cause, while remaining as we are&mdash;open, tolerant and honest&mdash;but also needing to be less selfish and always alert to the inequalities within our own borders.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I want to make a prediction. The prediction that I make to my colleagues is that, shortly after 1 July 1997, Telstra will introduce for a very select number of subscribers who live in exclusive suburbs in Sydney and Melbourne a cheaper local phone charge.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My prediction to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and to my colleagues is that the lower 20c rate in those very lucky suburbs will not be extended nationally to all of the other subscribers right across the country.

It will be available only in those suburbs where Optus has rolled out the pay TV cables and where Optus has introduced local phone calls. That is the prediction I make this afternoon.</PARA>

An article by Michael Gordon in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> reported what the Prime Minister allegedly said to his party room last week, and I would like to share it with the House. According to Michael Gordon, the Prime Minister made a `pledge to the government party&hyphen;room that those in remote areas will have all the "whiz-bangery" that the new <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8121"> technology has to offer'&mdash;and here is the crucial bit&mdash;`at the same price as those in the cities'. So the people in remote areas will get these new services at the same price as those people in the cities. That is what the Prime Minister said to his own party room last week, according to Michael Gordon. We put that to the Prime Minister yesterday, and he certainly did not deny it. So the Prime Minister's view is that the people in the bush should get these services at the same price as their city cousins.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the most basic service that people in the bush use? The answer is local calls. That is the most commonly used service and is the one that is most important to people who live in rural and regional Australia. That is the service that is at risk because Telstra has a monopoly on local telephone calls in almost every part of Australia. That is what the Prime Minister said to his party room last week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the House yesterday, we all know that the Prime Minister got into a bit of strife. The shoulders were twitching away. He was given a detailed briefing by the member for Bass, the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith), who is the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston). Lots of detailed information was given to the Treasurer (Mr Costello). The Treasurer rushed up to whisper in the Prime Minister's ear and, after getting that detailed briefing from the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts, this is the pearl of wisdom we got from the Prime Minister. In answer to our third question on whether there would be differential prices, the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me say in answer to the Leader of the Opposition that obviously the arrangements that apply in local areas covered by Telstra are going to continue.</PARA>
<PARA>So what are the arrangements that currently apply? There are three protections for people who live in the bush. Firstly, under section 183 of the Telecommunications Act, there is a ban on discriminatory pricing, except in certain circumstances that I will go to in a minute. Secondly, the minister has the power <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to direct the board of Telstra to carry out certain actions&mdash;for example, to look after people in the bush. Thirdly, at the moment, Telstra remains 100 per cent government owned. Ultimately, that means that the people of Australia can hold the government responsible for stupid decisions or decisions that adversely affect people in the bush. They are the three protections that people have under the current arrangements, arrangements which the Prime Minister said would continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once you remove those three elements&mdash;once you abolish section 183, once you remove the power of the minister to direct Telstra and once Telstra is no longer 100 per cent government owned&mdash;the protections that people in the bush have enjoyed to date will be lost. I will explain how that would occur in this matter of public importance this afternoon.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Revealed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> today was the government's view of the future under its changes to telecommunications. After the Prime Minister's shoulders were twitching during question time yesterday as he got into trouble, he got his office to speak to the media. This is what resulted in the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>. The article said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">His office said later that local call charges would not be allowed to rise in regional Australia&mdash;or anywhere else&mdash;but the extent of price reductions could vary between areas.</PARA>
<PARA>The extent of price reductions would vary, as I explained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, it costs 25c now for a local call in your electorate and in other electorates throughout the country. But, if Telstra dropped the price to only 20c in Chatswood to match Optus after 1 July 1997, do you think it would be fair to your constituents if they had to keep paying 25c for their local calls? That is what section 183 says. If Telstra wants to drop the price of local calls in Chatswood, it can drop the price of local calls right throughout the country, including Launceston. That is what section 183 tries to protect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the same article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, we have the following quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Communications, Senator Alston, has confirmed Telstra will be free to charge different prices for customers in different cities or towns when the industry is opened to all&hyphen;comers on July 1.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know that, once you sell a significant portion of a company, under Corporations Law you lose the ability to control the company, to direct the company to carry out your actions. The Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government, who is at the table, can confirm once again&mdash;we have had him confirm it once in the past&mdash;that, if the government does sell a third of its shares, the government cannot do what Senator Boswell and the National Party thinks it can do; the government cannot protect rural people, even <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8123"> though it has two-thirds of the shares. That would, in the words of corporate lawyers, oppress the minority shareholders. So it is quite clear that the government retaining two-thirds of the shares is no protection whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us focus on section 183. Having admitted in this morning's papers that Telstra will be allowed to reduce its local call charges in the affluent suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne but will not be forced to reduce prices in Launceston and all the other places, the government needed a line for question time. The line they had for question time&mdash;and no doubt the line that the minister will come up and parrot in his response this afternoon&mdash;was that section 183 might require you to have uniform prices across the country, but there are certain exceptions under section 185.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government used to be the telecommunication industry ombudsman, and he claims to understand the Telecommunications Act. This will put him to the test this afternoon: will he confirm for us that the only exceptions that are allowed under section 185 are discounts for flexiplans that are available to everyone in the country? They have to be freely available or they don't hold up. This includes the sorts of discounts that pensioners enjoy&mdash;every pensioner, right throughout the country. Also included are the sorts of discounts that are available to businesses that have got a certain volume. If they reach that certain volume, wherever they are in the country, they are entitled to that same discount under section 185.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, when you come to this dispatch box, you will have to admit that your defence in question time has come tumbling down. It is no coincidence that 25c is the standard rate for local calls in Launceston, Queensland and Western Australia. That is because of section 183. Section 183 and the power of the minister to direct Telstra are the only two things that stand between uniform local call charges across the country and affluent suburbs in Sydney and Melbourne getting that discount.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, you may wonder why I say it is only the people who live in the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> affluent suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne that will get the discounts. The reason I say that is that is where Optus Vision has chosen to roll out its pay TV cable in the first place and that is where Optus Vision is offering the 20c local call charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that section 183 should be retained because, if it is good enough to cut local call charges in Wollstonecraft, it should be good enough to cut local call charges in Wollongong. If it is good enough to cut local call charges in Hunters Hill, they should be cut in Pendle Hill as well. If they can be cut in Toorak, they should be cut in Ballarat as well. We believe that section 183 and the power to direct is what is required to make sure that that continues. Telstra has enormous market power. It has this monopoly inheritance. Section 183 makes sure that any concessions to people, wherever they may be, should flow on to all Australians, wherever they may live.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point we want to make is that at the moment Optus Vision is saying they will roll out in only some suburbs of Sydney, some suburbs of Melbourne, some suburbs of Adelaide and, if we are lucky, some suburbs of Brisbane. If you are not lucky enough to live in one of those affluent suburbs; if you make the mistake of living in Perth, or anywhere in Tasmania; or if you make the mistake of being a telephone subscriber in any regional town, any rural town, Optus Vision will not be installing the cables in your street. Some people might think that is a good thing. It means you will not get those cheaper local calls from Optus Vision. Under this government's telecommunication regime, if Optus Vision do not have a cable running down your street, you will not get the discounts on local calls. You will not get the benefits of that price competition that they are saying is going to flow across the land. That is the point we are trying to make. If you do not have section 183 and the power to direct, there will be enormous pressure on Telstra and its board to maximise its profits by dropping the prices only in those suburbs where there is direct competition with Optus Vision. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8124">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other defence the government had in question time was that they guarantee that through the price caps you will pay no more. They will not guarantee that you will pay the same. They will only guarantee that you will pay no more. We believe that, if it is good enough for people in the affluent suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne to get discounts on their local calls, those discounts should be available to all Australians&mdash;wherever they may live.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Prime Minister himself said when he launched the Optus Vision local call discounts, `The local telephone call is as Australian as a gum tree.' He said that it `gives comfort and support, particularly to older people'. That is what the Prime Minister said back in June. If it is like the Australian gum tree and it is giving support and comfort to Australians in affluent suburbs, why can't people who live outside those affluent suburbs get the same support and comfort at discount rates which people in the affluent suburbs of the Prime Minister's electorate are going to get?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) for his contribution. The issue basically is reflected in the words used by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) yesterday, when he asserted that `under the current law, Telstra price reductions in local calls in city areas must be passed on to subscribers in all areas'. That is the fundamental basis for the proposition that has been put by the Leader of the Opposition and supported in the MPI today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to the other matters that you raised, if time permits, I will try to address those. We did address a lot of those matters in May when we introduced the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill and again last week when we introduced the post&hyphen;1997 arrangements. We may not get to all of those issues, but there will perhaps be an opportunity when that debate comes on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the current telecommunications legislation regime, which was put in place in 1991 by the present Leader of the Opposition <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> when he was minister, it is clear from the information that I have been provided with&mdash;and I did fossick around this morning, after being challenged by the question asked yesterday&mdash;that Telstra can charge different amounts for local calls in the country as against the city if it can justify doing so on the basis of different costs, that is, Telstra can discriminate in this way if Austel decides that it is cost justified under section 185A(2) of the Telecommunications Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I pointed out in question time, you must read section 185 in conjunction with section 183. I will not quote those sections at present, but section 183 fundamentally says there shall not be a price discrimination except in circumstances under the exemptions, and 185A is one of the exemptions&mdash;that is, where a carrier can show that there are cost justification reasons for doing so. Quite clearly, it costs a lot more to provide call systems in remote or regional areas than it does in some closely populated urban areas, and that is why the exemption is there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1991, when the legislation that we are talking about came to the parliament, it was put forward by the current Leader of the Opposition when he was the minister. Again, in an interesting twist of irony&mdash;and there seem to be a few of those&mdash;I was the opposition spokesman on that occasion.</PARA>

That is because, broadly speaking, without being egotistical about this matter, I do understand what I am talking about. On that occasion we did support the commonsense approach taken.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite clear that no political party has ever sought to guarantee that after 1 July 1997 people in regional areas will pay identical local call prices to those paid by people in metropolitan areas. That is a point that you cannot jump over, because it is provided for in your own law. In December 1995, the previous government released an exposure draft, which I displayed in question time today, about the post&hyphen;1997 legislation, which <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8125"> gave no such guarantee and clearly allowed price discrimination between areas.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="LEE" NAMEID="MG4">

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GJ4">Mr WARWICK SMITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to the directive. The government's legislation reflects the position in Labor's exposure draft, and that was the point I made in the answer today. I can guarantee&mdash;and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) did this in question time today&mdash;that people, whether they live in the city or in the bush, will not pay more after 1 July 1997 than they do now. I refer you to the speech I made here in May about the current pricing arrangements with regard to local calls. They are currently charged out at about 25c each. Optus have indicated to the marketplace that they will pitch some of their local call prices at a lower rate. I believe that under increased competition we will see Telstra's local call prices move down. We have certainly seen that with the STD and IDD rates. I know the former minister would acknowledge that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also maintaining the existence of the price cap regime, which puts a ceiling on local calls&mdash;you cannot charge above a certain amount. So there will be competition below that ceiling, and that is a consumer protection arrangement which I articulated here earlier. We are also maintaining the option of untimed local voice calls for residential and business customers. Again, the Prime Minister made that point today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the coalition is doing&mdash;which, unfortunately, the Labor Party refuses to support&mdash;is providing an additional $250 million through the regional telecommunications infrastructure fund to ensure that regional areas have access to the infrastructure required to drive the competition that will push prices downwards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me explain the importance of that for regional and remote areas. What we understand, and what most people who look at telecommunications understand, is that the fundamental building blocks to telecommunications are the switching points. If you have got high level capacity switches and digital arrangements, such as ISDN&mdash;and we did talk about ISDN before; you made quite a song <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and dance about whether or not we would meet the commitments on ISDN&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GJ4">Mr WARWICK SMITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That fund will assist, and if you look closely at what the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Alston, has said, you will see that we have not walked away from it. This fund will make it possible for the upgrading of switches. I refer, for example, to Flinders Island, a remote area in the middle of Bass Strait which is part of my electorate. If they want to be part of the Internet arrangements&mdash;and this is in statements released by Senator Alston&mdash;there will be more Internet access points established through Telstra around Tasmania so that people can ring in at a local call rate for Internet access. That will be possible because of the upgrading of the switches to digital standard. This might occur in a town such as Longreach. They are fundamental issues that need to be addressed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you want to have the benefits of competition, with all that that brings&mdash;and we have seen some of that already&mdash;if you want to see it in the local call area and for regional and remote areas to get the benefit of it, you must have a rapid upgrading of that infrastructure. Telstra spends in the vicinity of $4 billion a year in infrastructure upgrading. We are saying there needs to be an additional push in upgrading infrastructure in those remote areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The way we have calculated the fund&mdash;and some people have made a bit of noise about this&mdash;is on the basis of the number of people who live outside capital cities. If you look at it, you will see that a state such as Tasmania has 59 per cent of its population in rural areas, outside capital cities. That is why it gets a proportionately larger amount. If you look at some of the earlier speeches that Senator Alston and I have made, you will see we have had a constant concern about regional and remote areas. You might criticise Senator Harradine and Senator Colston, but they appreciated the points we were making previously. The figure for Queensland is 54 per cent, and that is why they get that larger amount, to address those problems, to bring those people into the mainstream telecommunications infrastructure upgrading, so that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8126"> they can participate in the information age, trite though it is to say it. But we are in the information age and those people deserve to be part of it, just as much as anybody else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also important to recognise that Labor wants to deprive Australia of that telecommunications infrastructure. Australia will be unable to benefit from the lower prices and the better services that will flow from that infrastructure. Fundamentally, that is the driver behind what we are trying to achieve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In talking about price discrimination, the shadow minister at the table, the member for Dobell, would be well aware that in 1994 the then Labor government introduced amendments to make even more flexible the price discrimination arrangements.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister at the table also signed the instruments setting out December 1998 as the expiry date for the existing price cap regime. Nothing has changed since we came into government. We would expect to review the existing price cap regime as the expiry date approaches. So there is a fundamental issue that you are in a sense, to use the legal term, estopped from denying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You mentioned the ministerial direction in the Telstra bill. The answer fundamentally is the answer that I gave to you when you raised this issue during debate&mdash;and there were some 40 speakers during the debate back in May. I am advised that the ministerial direction power has never been used by a government. As we move towards greater competition and the commitment the government has made to the upgrading of infrastructure, then there is no necessity for there to be that ministerial directive power. Ministerial directive power is not in keeping with an instrumentality that has been taken to the marketplace.</PARA>

When I was a candidate in 1996, again the issue was raised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the government is proposing here with the regional fund is the first time a government has manifestly taken a proactive approach to address those issues. The strengthening of the universal service obligation in the arrangements for the post-1997 activity is a further issue that supports regional and remote dwellers in our nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have the consumer codes of practice across a wide range of issues and the customer service guarantee&mdash;that is, you have a guarantee from the carrier that, if it does not perform to certain criteria within certain periods of time, then it will be required to pay subscribers a financial penalty.

Those are the sorts of changes that have evolved over the period of time from 1991 to the new 1996 act, which will start in 1997. I think that is a particularly good issue for the government and for all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The overall growth in telecommunications demand is obviously huge. That demand and its impact on the service delivery are such that, with increasing competition and the emergence of niche players into the marketplace post-1997, there will be an added basis upon which you will see competition upon the pricing point. Therefore, I think the argument the Labor Party brings to the chamber is misplaced, because all it does is ignore what was put in place through its own period of stewardship of this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I go back to that micro&hyphen;economic reform progress report issued by Mr Beazley in November 1990. Section D22 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Telecom OTC will be required to charge for services on a uniform basis, except where price differences reflect demonstrated cost differences.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the point. That has been carried from 1990 right through to the legislation that I introduced here last week. To use, as you did yesterday, that as an issue through section 183 to distort the arguments and to ignore your own history on this issue does not do you any credit. It confuses the issue. It is clear that Mr Beazley was misinformed about what it was that he was saying. His memory, at best, was faulty about what the legislation did when he brought it into this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have carried through and enhanced the consumer issues. We have also established the regional fund, announced by Senator Alston, for the benefit of all Australians, but it is proportionately weighted towards those who live in regional and remote areas. I think that is commendable and should be supported. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;How devastating it must be for National Party backbenchers and those Liberals representing <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> rural and regional seats to hear the performance  today of the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith). No wonder only one of them is in the chamber. I recognise that the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) is here. How demoralising it must be. It was the same case during the second reading speeches on the Telstra bill: only two National Party members chose to come in here to attempt to defend the government on the partial privatisation of Telstra. Again, I am pleased to be able to recognise that the member for Lyne was one of those members.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> How demoralising it must be, particularly for those in marginal seats, to finally come to the realisation that they do not matter, that rural and regional Australia does not matter, that they are irrelevant and that they are dispensable. It has been clear since the earliest days of the Howard government that the National Party's invitation to form part of the government was only a token gesture. They were invited to share in the spoils, to share the big offices, to share the big pay packets and to share the big staff allocations, but they were clearly told not to expect to have any power, not to expect to have any say whatsoever in the running of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Plenty of support exists for this proposition, including the government's decision to cut funding to regional universities, the decision to cut $622 million from the national highway program over the next four years, the decision to totally abolish the Division of Regional Development, the decision to slash ABC funding, the $16 million reduction in funding to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, the $5 million cut to ABARE's funding and the cuts to CSIRO's funding. I could go on and on. If I did go on, I would particularly concentrate on all the other decisions that impact disproportionately upon rural and regional Australia, such as the cuts to labour market programs, the closure of Medicare, CES and DSS offices and the closure of Family Court registries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The National Party obviously does not get a say. I take the opportunity to point out that that has been confirmed once again by Minister Anderson's inept handling of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8128"> importation of cooked chicken meat issue where he gave an absolutely ironclad guarantee to the industry prior to the election but, on coming to government, learned very quickly that he had no power whatsoever to influence the decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now, as another slap in the face of National Party members in this place, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has passed up the opportunity to guarantee to all of us in this place that a fairer telecommunications system will be given to all Australians, whether they live in the capital cities or in rural Australia. More importantly, the ultimate slap in the face has come with the Prime Minister's statement that the flogging of all of Telstra is an inevitability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the second reading debate on the bill, member after member on the government side came into this place and told us that rural and regional Australia would be protected because the government would retain a two&hyphen;third ownership. What a surprise Mr Howard's revelation is. What was the protection they were referring to? They were referring, mainly, to Telstra's community service obligations, to untimed local telephone calls, to the protection that ensures people in my electorate&mdash;people in Muswellbrook and Singleton&mdash;can have a telephone connected as cheaply as their city counterparts rather than paying the $1,500 to $1,600, which is the true cost of such a service. They were referring to their confidence that, under a partially privatised Telstra, kids in the bush would have the same educational opportunities as their city counterparts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me share with the House what the member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) had to say during his speech in the second reading debate. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you listened to the opposition, you would think we were selling it all off . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The member for Lyne said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Leader of the Opposition is trying to cast aspersions on this bill and the way we propose to proceed with the sale of one-third of Telstra by comparing the situation with the sales of British Telecom and Telecom in New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We know they were done differently. They were put on the open market and sold completely.</PARA>
<PARA>How misguided was the faith of National Party members in the Prime Minister and the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston)? But Senators Harradine and Colston were a little more sceptical. Unlike members of the National Party in this place and Liberals representing regional areas, they had the opportunity to do something about it. They wrangled from the government a commitment that a slush fund would be created and that the lion's share of that money would be spent in their respective states&mdash;$27 per capita in Tasmania and $29 per capita in Queensland. What is it in New South Wales, the National Party's strongest state, their real stronghold? Just $16 per capita. For members of the National Party and Liberal backbenchers it is now a case of once bitten, twice shy. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>  of yesterday and today highlights that point. The article yesterday said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">National and Liberal Party backbenchers from rural areas plan to raise questions this week about the State breakdown of the Government's $250 million regional telecommunications infrastructure fund and about the effectiveness of the universal service obligations in the Telstra sale legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>Today's article says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">National Party MP Mr Michael Cobb said he planned to raise in today's Coalition party room meeting concerns about the "disproportionate" carve&hyphen;up of funds from the $250 million telecommunications rural infrastructure fund.</PARA>
<PARA>The article goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Cobb, whose electorate of Parkes covers a large area of New South Wales, told AAP: "New South Wales has got the short end of the straw, so I'm looking for a reasonable explanation . . . "</PARA>
<PARA>Why wouldn't he? Wouldn't we all like to know the outcome of that party room meeting this morning? This is not the approach adopted by Senator Boswell, and this was touched on by the member for Dobell (Mr Lee). With respect to the impact on rural and regional Australia of the sale of Telstra, Senator Boswell is placing his faith in Minister Alston and the Prime Minister&mdash;the same Prime Minister who conceded in this place yesterday that he did not have a full briefing on his government's telecommunications reforms. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8129"> The same Senator Alston had this to say in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  today:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Communications, Senator Alston, has confirmed Telstra will be free to charge different prices for customers in different cities or towns when the industry is opened to all&hyphen;comers on July 1.</PARA>
<PARA>Building on what the member for Dobell had to say, let me quote what Senator Boswell had to say on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS>  this morning&mdash;because he has still got plenty of faith:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">SUZANNE SMITH:</EMPHASIS>  Senator Boswell, isn't Kim Beazley right when he says .. I mean, isn't it just commonsense to think that where there's competition with Optus prices will fall and that's in the main cities; and where there isn't, they'll remain the same or go up?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">RON BOSWELL:</EMPHASIS>  Look, with reference to rural Australia and regional Australia, the Prime Minister has made a commitment to the party room that rural Australia and regional Australia will be no worse off than they are now and in many cases they will be better off. He has made the commitment that he will promise all the state&hyphen;of&hyphen;the&hyphen;art equipment that'll run faxes, that'll run computers, that will be the equivalent of anything that is in the cities.</PARA>
<PARA>But here's the good bit:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">SUZANNE SMITH: </EMPHASIS> But Senator Boswell, how can you make that guarantee when it's privatised?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">RON BOSWELL:</EMPHASIS>  Well, It isn't privatised at the moment and the Government owns two&hyphen;thirds of it. So, the Government is a majority shareholder. So let's not jump the sense of the bridges that we haven't come to yet.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Boswell finishes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I'm taking the Prime Minister at his word that rural Australia will be better off; they won't be worse off; and I believe him . . . </PARA>
<PARA>What misguided and blinded faith. I hope that the member for Lyne is not going to rise in this place and express the same sort of misguided faith.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to some of the matters raised by the minister and the shadow minister. While the minister has been able to find a single bureaucrat who is willing to suggest the contrary, under section 183 of the Telecommunications Act, Telstra is required to pass on the benefits of competition to rural and regional Australia. Although the minister suggested that it is not forced to, that is certainly the case. I think the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> shadow minister, the member for Dobell, has adequately covered that matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In other words, while residents in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra can look forward to reductions in the cost of their telephone calls, for people in my electorate, for people in the Hunter and in many other areas in rural Australia, it is simply bad luck. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it is not a personal explanation. I might start off just answering a few of the comments. Seeing that the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) stole a bit of licence and started talking about chicken meat and all sorts of other matters unrelated to this MPI and was casting aspersions on what has been achieved by the National Party for our constituency in Australia, I might just remind him&mdash;and his electorate is not very far from mine&mdash;of a few of the benefits that have flowed to the mid&hyphen;north coast of New South Wales since this government was elected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For a start, the Southern Cross University's funding was increased by three per cent, not decreased, and the Pacific Highway has received $750 million over the next 10 years. And the previous government, of which your father was a member, could never achieve that. You had two Labor members on the north coast of New South Wales and you could never achieve that. It took a coalition government to achieve it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The greatest thing that is going to happen for our constituency from this government is the $1 billion environment package because it is all going to be spent in regional Australia&mdash;$1 billion worth, all going to be spent in regional Australia. How thick are you people? You have got no idea what is going on around this place. You grasp hold of these miserable lines and run with them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8130"> Another thing that would interest the shadow minister sitting at the table is the extension of SBS into the mid-north coast and the north coast of New South Wales&mdash;something he could not achieve when he was the minister, notwithstanding all the represen tations from those members on the mid&hyphen;north coast and some of his own members who were representing the area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to the funding to Skillshare: all the skillshares in my electorate got re&hyphen;funded, with representations from me and the other members up and down the coast. So the member for Hunter is way off cue. He might look at some of the roads that are going to have some money spent on them in his own area. He need not talk about this government neglecting regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This debate is all about the fact that the Labor Party are hurting on this issue. They went to the 2 March election and made a big thing out of our policy, clearly enunciated to the people of Australia, that we were going to sell one&hyphen;third of Telstra, we were going to apply $1 billion to the environment and we were going to use the balance of the money to retire debt&mdash;which would mean that we would have in excess of $250 million, less interest, to pay each year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We went to the people of Australia in March on that basis. The Labor Party vehemently opposed it. They used the same scaremongering tactics during that election campaign as they are trying to use today in trying to scare people in regional Australia. The Labor Party and their ACTU mates who funded a lot of it went round to regional Australia putting stickers on Telstra phone booths&mdash;defacing public property and trying to scare old people in regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the worst thing they did, the lowest thing they did, was when the ALP and their industrial wing, the ACTU, printed bogus Telecom accounts. What are you going to say now, member for Hunter, because they came out of your area? They came out of Newcastle into my electorate and they were distributed to people. I was getting phone calls from old people, pensioners, who were absolutely frightened and saying, `I've got this enormous telephone account. I haven't used my phone that much.' When we got to the bottom of it, we found out that the Labor Party and the ACTU were using this as an election campaign stunt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people of Australia saw right through that because they got rid of the Labor Party <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in the 2 March election. They voted for the government and they voted for this measure that is being introduced. They voted for $1 billion to be spent on the environment. They voted for $7 billion of debt to be retired because they know that the benefits of those responsible actions by this government will flow on to all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was interesting to see in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on the weekend an article which probably highlights what this MPI is all about. It is all about the Labor Party being beaten in the Senate by two of their disaffected members, who got smart and left the Labor Party. Just like 18 million people in Australia left the Labor Party on 2 March, so did two of their gun senators. The article from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Federal Labor has had better years. It lost government, it lost 32 Labor seats in an election in which it suffered its worst primary vote in 60 years, it lost its former Prime Minister, it was humiliated in losing the Lindsay by&hyphen;election, it lost the fight on behalf of its union base against the new industrial relations laws. Now, in losing the Telstra battle in Parliament, the ultimate indignity: Labor loses it on the votes of two ex&hyphen;Labor members . . . </PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>That is what this MPI is all about. The Labor Party are hurting because two of their disaffected former members, who were smart enough to see the benefit in what the government was doing, got the message from the Australian people that the government was on the right track and voted with the government. They left the Labor Party and voted with the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of those former members was expelled two decades ago&mdash;he has waited a long time to get square but he has fixed them up now&mdash;and one, after 21 years of Labor patronage, walked out for a better offer from Labor's opponents. Kim Beazley and Labor will not easily forget 1996 because, on the back of this and other government measures that we were elected to introduce, they will see this government remain in government for many years to come. It does not matter how much mealy&hyphen;mouthed stuff we get from Labor's frontbenchers and backbenchers when they come in here spruiking about what this government is doing, people in Australia remember. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8131">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think one of our frontbenchers in question time today mentioned the l&hyphen;a&hyphen;w tax cuts. People in Australia will never forget that. The people who were here in the last parliament, sitting over there behind Prime Minister Keating, bowing and scraping to him and believing every word that he said, will not forget it either because they know that is what hung them. They know that the people of Australia will not forget that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people of Australia voted for this government to introduce the measures that we are debating in this MPI. They expect this government to introduce them. Two of your disaffected senators realised that the people of Australia were right. The evidence is on the record. We have had many debates in this place about what Labor was going to do with Telstra if it had been re&hyphen;elected.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1991 the Beazley act, the labour law, was introduced, allowing discrimination where it could be justified. We have heard the twists and the turns on the two sections in the act but the fact remains that the 1991 act allowed it. In 1994, the amending act was introduced by the then minister, the member for Dobell (Mr Lee), who is at the table, providing further flexibility for allowing discrimination. I have with me the then minister's second <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reading speech when he introduced that amendment. I do not have time to read it but honourable members would do well to read for themselves what the then minister had to say when he introduced it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1995, Labor's exposure draft of the post&hyphen;1997 telecommunications act did exactly the same thing. Now in 1996, the same post&hyphen;1997 legislative package being introduced by this government is being opposed by those opposite. The minister showed them that at question time; he showed them the act, showed them what they are opposing. It is unbelievable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the matter of nine short months you have been converted on the road to Damascus. You were going to sell all of Telstra, you were going to introduce the same legislation that we are introducing now. Now you are opposing the sale of one&hyphen;third of Telstra, after two of your senators saw the light, moved over and voted with the government in support of it, leaving the Labor Party the same as 18 million Australians did in March of this year, reducing you to a rump in this place. Yet you come in here, arguing that what the government is doing is wrong and will detrimentally affect regional and rural Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are spending $1 billion, predominantly in rural and regional Australia, doing what the Labor Party in 13 years of power could never do and never even got excited about. Going back to the comments made by the member for Hunter, they never got excited about and never spent any money on the Pacific Highway. They just ignored regional Australia. Yet they come in here and have a go at the government about what we are trying to do. We are rebuilding the environment and making sustainable agriculture a feature of the future.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, the bills before the House today&mdash;the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1996 and cognate bills&mdash;are part of the government's strategy to produce an appropriate migration program for Australia in the late 20th century. Australia is built on migration, and migration has formed the character of our multi&hyphen;ethnic society. Two of my grandparents were descendants of German immigrants; two were descendants of Scottish immigrants. My husband was a migrant from Central Europe. And although my children have always been Australian citizens, all three were born in North America.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has attracted migrants from all over the globe, and much of our heritage has been developed by their influence. Economic growth has been stimulated by their contributions, and the same migrants who have made <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> their homes in Australia have sought to bring members of their wider family to join them. Without its diverse and multi&hyphen;ethnic migration program, Australia would be a much poorer place than it is today, not just economically but culturally, socially and intellectually.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of migration policy is to develop both the economic interests of the nation and to look after the needs of the migrants themselves. Importantly, an economically strong Australia is in the best interests of migrants because this is how they and their families will become prosperous. Recently, the number of family reunion migrants has far outweighed those in other migration categories. The government seeks to restore the balance of the program by increasing the proportion of migrants with skills important to Australia's economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the limit to the migration program of 74,000 for 1996-97&mdash;equal to the average of the last four years&mdash;has been set, the increase in skilled migration can only be achieved by reducing migrants in the family stream. To achieve a reduction in the family stream, which changes it from close to 70 per cent of the program to just over 60 per cent, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) put forward regulations that would have required sponsors of family members to be Australian citizens and for sponsored parents to have more children resident in Australia than overseas. These regulations were disallowed by the Senate on 7 November. The current legislation was intended to work in concert with those now disallowed regulations by allowing the minister to limit the number of migrants in specified categories, queue applications into the following year and prescribe a cohabitation period for de facto spouses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cognate bills roll visa application fees, the health service charge and the English education charge into a simplified single visa charge and clarify migrants' entitlement to English tuition. They also amend section 21 of the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 and the Migration Act 1958 to allow the minister to revoke Australian citizenship when it was obtained as a result of fraud when the migrant was applying for permanent residency.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition says it has accepted the proposed size and composition of the government's migration program for 1996-97, although the less than strong endorsement of the shadow minister, the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr)&mdash;`we have accepted the government's authority and decision to control the size of the program and the composition of the program'&mdash;is so equivocal as to allow the opposition to placate those who want a smaller program and those who do not, those who want a change to the program balance and those who do not. With the added cryptic rider `except where it conflicts with basic human rights such as would be destructive of the rights of Australian families', the shadow minister has allowed himself the luxury of reading the wind on the migration debate before adopting whatever position appears politic at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do recognise the honourable member's dilemma. What benefit is a definitive statement now if it spoils the chance to join the Democrats later? While it is unedifying to believe that it is the Democrat tail wagging the ALP dog, it is better than believing that behind the shadow minister's decision to equivocate, rather than to take a stand, was the fear that he would evoke the ire, and hence lose the votes, of those on one or the other side of the immigration debate. By placing caveats on its support for the government's right to determine the size and composition of the migration program, the opposition can now claim to support the program goals while simultaneously opposing the regulations and legislation necessary for the government to put its program into effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> On the question of migration numbers, the opposition has not opposed the current quota of 74,000, and in the shadow minister's speech he came close to endorsing it. While the government's migration target has received bipartisan support, it is important to acknowledge that a large number of people believe that 74,000 is too high. While some of those voicing such a complaint do so from a fear of different cultures, they are a small minority. In general, the call for less migration arises because of high unemploy ment and fear for jobs or a concern about Australia's environmental vulnerability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have not had a thoroughgoing investigation into Australia's population dynamics since the national population inquiry of Professor Borrie in 1975. In the face of conflicting estimates of Australia's optimum population, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Long Term Strategies failed to provide an answer to the question of a sustainable population for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I regret that the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), who chaired the committee, did not provide alternative models taking into account environmental, technological, economic and lifestyle assumptions. We may have been left as much in the wilderness as we are now, but at least the wilderness would have had a couple of signposts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need a debate on population policy because, like Professor Graeme Hugo of Adelaide University, I believe it is fundamental for the long-term future of this country. It is within the context of population policy, which sets a direction for Australia into the next millennium, that we should determine our migration policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much of the debate on the bills today centres on the minister's changes to the legislation which would allow him, if necessary, to cap the number of spouse, parent and dependent child visas granted in any one year and to queue them into the next. The minister does not do this lightly. In Australia we have taken for granted the fact that Australians should be able to marry the person of his or her choice and bring them to Australia as potential citizens. We support the right of an Australian citizen to bring in his or her dependent child or children, and it has been our custom to allow our migrant citizens to sponsor their elderly parents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the past years, the migration program has become skewed towards the family stream&mdash;concessional and preferential&mdash;which grew by 27 per cent in 1995-96 to almost 70 per cent of the entire program. If the 1995-96 demand had stabilised, the family stream would constitute 76 per cent of our migration for this year. If growth had continued at the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8134"> same rate it would be 97 per cent of the program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Economically, Australia has not been doing as well as it should, and no-one questions the need to pick up our economic performance by expanding our economic opportunities. Our migration program should reflect that need as much as any other program. If we are to limit migration, there is a clear need to ensure that, within that limit, the family stream does not overwhelm the numbers and we continue to secure migrants with high skills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the government's proposed program, spouses, dependent children and aged parents will still be able to migrate to Australia but not necessarily in the year of their choice; some may have to wait. For those who do, we have to regret their discomfort without embracing the alternative&mdash;that is, put up with an unacceptably disproportionate migration program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Without the proposed legislation, under section 39 of the Migration Act, the minister could still limit the number of relatives coming into Australia in the preferential family category, although he would not be able to queue those applicants who miss out into the next year. By deleting section 87 of the act, the minister can, however, cap and queue applicants in all categories under sections 85 and 86.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In rejecting this legislation, the shadow minister seeks to prevent parents, spouses and children who miss out in one year from being placed at the beginning of the queue in the following year and forces them to commence again with a totally new application in the following year with no surety that they will not miss out again. Perhaps members on the other side can explain why they have adopted this position if they are, as they claim, interested in assisting spouses, children and parents to join their families in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Capping and queuing is a strategy of the government to reduce the size of the preferential family category. To reduce the pressure within this category, the government has restricted sponsorship of spouses, aged parents and dependent children to Australian citizens and has introduced a minimum cohabitation <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> period before de facto spouses can be sponsored.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to discuss both these measures&mdash;the citizenship requirement for sponsorship and a minimum cohabitation for recognition of de facto relationships&mdash;although it is only the latter that is the subject of the current legislation. First of all, I want to state clearly that I believe both are practical ways of achieving the desired outcome, and philosophically I do not have problems with either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I was 15 I asked a businessman from another country who was living here what he thought of Australia. His reply was a contemptuous, `It's a good place to make money,' with the implication that, on all other criteria, we were really rather inferior. He wanted to live here to enjoy the benefits that Australia could offer, but he did not want, or need, to take out Australian citizenship. That time has passed and now we expect more from those who choose to live here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Citizenship brings with it responsibilities and rights and indicates a commitment to a particular country. It is true that dual citizenship has made this commitment easier for some than for others. But if, for whatever reason, permanent residents are reluctant to make a commitment to Australia by taking out citizenship then they must be prepared to accept the consequences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On de facto spouse immigration, currently Australia has an extremely liberal policy, officially requiring no period of cohabitation. Most countries do not recognise de facto spouses as a legitimate category for migration, and generally those countries that do, such as New Zealand, require a two&hyphen;year cohabitation. We need to maintain the de facto spouse category within the family category to overcome individual situations where a couple, for whatever reason, cannot legitimately marry. But it is not incumbent on the Australian government to treat de facto couples as if they were married.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For most couples, the decision to marry is their own, as is their decision to live in Australia. If couples see this as too onerous a choice, then perhaps they should question the strength of their relationship or the strength of their desire to migrate to and live <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8135"> in Australia. With thousands wanting to migrate to Australia and unable to do so, there is no reason why we should encourage some people to come here as prospective citizens on the basis of a relationship that has neither been tested by time nor cemented by ceremony.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although the three migration bills debated here today will be passed by the House, I understand that in the Senate the opposition will combine with the Australian Democrats to reject the bills, as they did the regulations, in order to bring a halt to the government's migration program. In opposing elements of the coalition's migration program, the opposition's strategy has been to use innuendo to strengthen its rhetoric and smear to bolster its argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 7 November, in opposing regulations that would have awarded points for English language proficiency in the concessional family category, Senator Bolkus, representing the shadow minister in the Senate, accused the government of racial discrimination. Although English points for the concessional category are not under debate today, accusations of racial discrimination have such an unpleasant implication that it is important to take the time to refute the opposition's contention that the inclusion of English language points in the concessional category is racially discriminatory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, English points will apply only to concessional and not preferential migration. Children, spouses and aged parents can continue to enter Australia whether or not they can speak English. Secondly, although English language proficiency will be of benefit for entry, it is still not a necessary condition, and an applicant with high skill points will be accepted on the basis of those skill points alone. Thirdly, although those who enter under the concessional family category obtain points for their relationships to Australian citizens, their acceptance has always been dependent on school level. It makes sense to add English language as part of the applicant's&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Bolkus adopted a dangerous and false position when, in his speech, he accused the government of racially discriminatory policies and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) of having a racially discriminatory agenda. By his comments, Senator Bolkus has raised one further notch the already highly unpleasant race debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was disappointed that the shadow minister, the member for Denison, followed the lead of Senator Bolkus in attributing racist motives to the government. In his speech to the House on 2 December on the present bills, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This government has distinguished itself as the first government in this country in living memory to seek to embark on a social engineering program of a kind never contemplated previously by any Australian government, one more fitting totalitarian societies.</PARA>
<PARA>I would like the shadow minister in the consideration in detail stage to more clearly articulate why Australia is approaching a totalitarian society and the nature of the social engineering we are supposed to be undertaking. I would be fascinated by the shadow minister's explanation because he knows as well as all other members in this House that such accusations are ridiculous. This extreme form of hyperbole contributes nothing to the debate and detracts from the shadow minister's credibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Equally as serious and more contemptible is the shadow minister's claim that in this legislation the coalition is speaking in code. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8136"> The shadow minister is careful not to spell out exactly what this code is saying, except that it is `appealing to the sentiments in the community' and is `pitched at a certain frequency and to a certain audience'. Such phrases could mean anything, but I suspect the shadow minister wishes to imply by his very ambiguity that the coalition's program is appealing to racists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I personally take exception to the shadow minister's comments, especially to the way he has phrased them. If he wishes to call this legislation racist, for heaven's sake make the accusation plain and let us debate it. The reason the shadow minister has chosen to use innuendo is that he knows he cannot substantiate such a direct attack.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not racist to insist that migrants to this country pay their way. Australia's needs have changed since the days when migrants were given assisted passage to meet Australia's need for a larger population. It is not racially discriminatory to require that residents be Australian citizens to sponsor other migrants. It is not racially discriminatory to insist that de facto relationships require a cohabitation period for sponsorship. It is not racially discriminatory to want a higher skilled migrant base. As English is the language of this country, as I have already argued, it is not racially discriminatory to award points for English language skills. If it is, the Labor Party must face the same accusation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) made her comments out of ignorance and inexperience. Senator Bolkus and the shadow minister and those in opposition who are prepared to echo their words have done something much worse. Knowing the consequences, they have deliberately inflamed the race debate. By implication they have labelled all coalition members racist&mdash;knowing that we are not&mdash;and in doing so have subjected Australia to disapprobation from the rest of world. When opposition shadow ministers accuse the government of race driven policies rather than contributing to better legislation, they are deliberately driving the race debate in Australia, legitimising racist thought and provoking fear and division within the community. I commend the bills to the House.</PARA>

I intend to do that as a member of this parliament and as a person who has been concerned with human rights for a very long time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has happened in this case is very clear in the politics of the Liberal Party. The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock)&mdash;who, unfortunately, is not here to listen to the debate&mdash;has always opposed clauses of this kind. Unfortunately, the immigration minister is now under a lot of pressure from the Prime Minister and others who are more right wing and more ferocious in their policies. What have these people done? They have applied pressure so as to make him adopt a policy and a position which is totally unacceptable on human rights grounds. If you think that I am making a mistake about the minister, let me quote what <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8137"> he said on this matter in 1989. This is what Philip Ruddock said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I regard it as absolutely unconscionable for a government to say half way through the year, `We have enough spouses in now, we are going to close off the category and no more people in that category can come to Australia&mdash;no more husbands and wives, no more dependent children, or aged parents.' I am glad that the Minister&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and he was referring to the minister at that time&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">has made the decision to exclude those groups.</PARA>
<PARA>Yes, in making certain key decisions at that time, we excluded those groups&mdash;the so-called preferential family category&mdash;precisely because this is the category that has always been considered in the immigration system as being demand driven, as having a right to come into this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why do we say that? Because it is a fundamental human right that one is able to be reunited with one's wife or husband. To hear the member for Hindmarsh say, `It is only an inconvenience,' it is all right for her and for others to talk about it being only an inconvenience when you are married and separated forcibly in circumstances where you cannot rejoin but have done nothing wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point is that some people will think that this measure is going to keep out a few people, recent migrants, and that it is only going to apply in a limited way. This measure applies to all Australians. This measure will affect anyone, no matter whether they are of migrant background or not, who goes overseas, falls in love and wants to get married. What will happen? They will have to wait in a queue for their spouse to come to Australia, a queue which could last 18 months or more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us imagine anyone's brother, sister or children who may want to get married. They meet somebody nice from another country. And what happens? They are not allowed to bring them to Australia without a long waiting period. This is a remarkable measure. Why did the minister get himself into this trouble? He uses all these facts and statistics and says that under the Labor government there was a big increase in the preferential category of spouses.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The minister is implying that the vast bulk of this increase is due to some kind of rort and that suddenly people have decided that the spouse category is a way of getting into Australia. This is not the true explanation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I go into the true explanation, let me talk a bit about so&hyphen;called non-genuine marriages. I know a lot about this because I was Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration at the time we produced a report on this issue. In that report, we recommended a number of tough measures in relation to non-genuine spouses. In fact, the current government wants to make those measures even tougher in some respects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is all right. We are not in favour of non-genuine marriages; we are not in favour of marriages of convenience for the sake of immigration. That is one thing, but it is another to try to claim that, because there has been a temporary increase in the preferential family category, there has suddenly been an increase in the rorting by Australians of the immigration system. That is not the true explanation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The minister, in a number of answers to questions in this place, has never referred to the true explanation. The true explanation is that in the last three years we have had the acceptance of two groups of people that were <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8138"> not previously expected to be in the regular program. One group is the 40,000 or so Chinese students who were accepted for permanent residence and the other group was the big increase in the special humanitarian category for people from eastern Europe and other places such as Bosnia&hyphen;Herzegovina.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had an increase in those categories. Naturally, once those people gained permanent residence, a number of them would have been expected, would they not, to have been able to bring their spouses or their fiances to Australia? So we had this sudden increase. The minister comes in and says, `The preferential category is going out of control; therefore, we must cap it. We must bring in these new rules and regulations,' which effectively take away the fundamental human right of union for spouses, for a husband and a wife.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But these new rules and regulations also affect dependent children. That is an amazing one, isn't it? We are not talking about children over 18; we are talking about dependent children. For some reason or another, someone who has come to Australia but who then wants to bring their child here is told, `I am sorry, you're not allowed to do this because you have to get into a queue.'

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do you know what the concessional family category is? It is the brothers and sisters and nephews and nieces.

Aren't you going to discriminate between those nations where it just so happens that English is a major language or the major language and those nations in which English is not? Of course, you are.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party took this decision very carefully in its response to the Fitzgerald report. Because Fitzgerald required it, we said, `There will be an English language requirement in the independent category. We understand that if these people want to come independently and make a contribution as skilled migrants, then, fair enough, they should make the effort to have a knowledge of English.' But, when it comes to brothers and sisters and nephews and nieces, if you introduce an English language requirement, you effectively are saying that those nations which do not have English as the primary language will be discriminated against.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister knows this, even though the member for Hindmarsh does not know. She says, `What is the difference?' There is a difference. All of these things are very important and can be explained. She tried to make out that our opposition to the English language requirement in the concessional family reunion was some inconsistency, had no rationale and was an extension of our view. All that is absolutely false. She fails to understand the difference between those two categories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are we going to do about this? First of all, it has been mentioned that we are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8139"> going to vote against this measure in the Senate because we consider it totally unjustifiable on human rights and other grounds. Secondly, in the event that the government thinks that it is going to make some kinds of threats on this matter, I can assure you that we are ready for all consequences. The leader and the shadow minister made it perfectly clear that we will not back off on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you want to use this for some other political purposes, so be it. We are not going to allow a situation in the Senate where this legislation passes if we can prevent it. Who knows what is going to happen in the Senate nowadays? We are going to oppose these measures totally in the Senate. We believe that they are totally unjustified. As the shadow minister has already said, you can frame a fair, reasonable and balanced immigration program on the numbers for this year without resorting to these sorts of measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The capping power the minister seeks is a very dangerous power. It means that the control which the parliament will have over the immigration program will become a nonsense. The parliament has a program, a set of categories and regulations. The minister says, `That is all very well. I will cap this one and not that one. Therefore, I will get an outcome that I want,' irrespective of whether it has anything to do with the real intentions of the parliament on the immigration program. That would be a very serious change in the way in which the immigration program has operated to this point&mdash;at least I believe it would be, from my knowledge of the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think there has been a request from a minister for a long time to have this sort of power over the immigration program. By capping specific categories, we then end up with a situation where the program can be manipulated in such a way as to suit the outcomes which the minister desires. The minister has come forward with this, not believing a word of it&mdash;especially this stuff about spouses. He does not believe this; it is not correct. I have already quoted what he said and I could quote other speeches of his. He has a record on human rights. I find it absolutely appalling that he should come here <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and support this approach. We should have a more cooperative approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a committee chaired by the member for Hindmarsh. I chaired that committee before. We do not believe this matter is intractable. If the minister thinks it is intractable, why did he not refer the matter to the committee for an urgent report? We have had months to consider this matter. We could have had the matter considered by the committee. We would have had input from the opposition. We could have tried to get a genuine resolution of the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the minister is really serious and wants to find some solution to what he considers is a problem&mdash;I have already explained that, in my view, it is a temporary problem to do with special sets of people coming in at a particular time&mdash;he could have taken the matter to the Joint Standing Committee on Migration and said, `Give me a bipartisan report on how to resolve this matter.' This is not something which has not been done. I remember it specifically being done when we had a problem with refugees and refugee control when I was chairman at one time. The minister knows he could have done that because he was on those committees all that time. Instead of that, we have this unilateral inquisition from the top and these very difficult measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to refer to another measure: the so&hyphen;called English education charge. People who have been accepted to come to Australia under certain categories need a knowledge of English language. At present it is proposed to limit those without knowledge of English.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Development of operational facilities at RAAF Base Tindal, NT.</PARA>
<PARA>The Department of Defence proposes to construct new facilities to improve the operational effectiveness of RAAF Base Tindal. RAAF Base Tindal forms part of a chain of defensive airfields across northern Australia and is vital to the air defence of northern Australia. It is the home base for a fighter squadron and supporting RAAF elements. Together with RAAF Base Darwin, it is used for operational training of air elements of the Australian Defence Force, often in conjunction with regional air elements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposal will provide explosive ordnance aprons for maritime, patrol and transport aircraft, alert facilities for fighter aircraft, operational and technical support facilities and living accommodation for personnel during exercises and contingencies. The estimated outturn cost is $31.4 million. It is anticipated that the construction will start in May 1997 and be completed by November 1999.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Public Works Committee, in its report tabled on 4 December 1996, concluded that there is a need for the project and recommended that it proceed subject to the following recommendation: that a further evaluation of the cost and benefits of covered accommodation be undertaken and resubmitted to the committee before this component of the project is commenced. The Department of Defence agrees to the recommendation and will institute measures to conform and report back to the PWC.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to remark on the comments of the member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) prior to the suspension of the sitting for dinner. He is rightly enthusiastic about this subject, but perhaps he could apply his self-proclaimed expertise more in relation to the proposals currently before the House. I might further add that the member might wish to constructively participate in the debate on the bill before trotting off to an international agency looking for an opinion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The three cognate bills on migration being considered here today come at a very useful time. It is a time when many Australians have lost confidence in the migration program because of the way in which it was operated and manipulated by the former Labor government. The former government discredited the program. Labor created the community's concern about the migration program and, once again, this government is left to fix it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1996, the Migration (Visa Application) Charge Bill 1996 and the Immigration (Education) Charge Amendment Bill 1996 are some of the sensible and measured steps that this government is pursuing to rebuild community confidence in the migration program. The measures contained in these bills seek to realign the migration program clearly with our national interest and, in turn, rebuild community support for the program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before making some specific comments about these bills, let me share with you where <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8141"> I view these things from. Madam Acting Deputy Speaker, I am sure you would agree that often your view of things is more influenced by your vantage point than the nature of the issue itself. Here is my vantage point. When Hubert Opperman, the then member for Corio and Minister for Immigration, rose in the House of Representatives on 6 March 1966 to deliver a ministerial statement that effectively ended the White Australia policy, a child had not long been brought home from the Albury Base Hospital to his older brother and proud parents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the 15-year rule period of stay requirement for non-European temporary entry permit holders seeking residency or citizenship status was being buried, a fibro house in Davies Street, Albury, near the cemetery was becoming the home of a new Australian. The new Australian was me&mdash;coming into an Australia that a minister from our side of politics, who was a great Australian, had freed from the White Australia policy. I know no other Australia than one that is and has always been accepting of and accepted by people who come from all around the world without discrimination to make a contribution to our nation and to seek better lives for themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Through my experience from birthday parties at my brother's school, where the majority of children could not speak English, to the Malaysian students who lived next door to our flat in Carnegie, who often took us on outings and were our on-hand baby&hyphen;sitters, all the way through to teaching Turks at my primary school how to play cricket, and to my high school days, where I was surrounded by Scottish, German, Swedish, Italian, Dutch and Pacific islander friends, this is the world that I have come to know. I have been involved with people who come from all corners of the world. The richness and diversity of our community has always been around me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tina's and my wedding day, in a Greek Orthodox Church with an English best man and Scots, Greeks and `skips' in the bridal party, was a celebration of many dimensions. I was not so quick to learn that I was the `skip' my in&hyphen;laws and wife&hyphen;to&hyphen;be referred to, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> while I thought we were talking about the need to hire a cart&hyphen;away dumpster.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know no other Australia than one that embraces the diversity and similarities of people from all walks of life and cultural backgrounds who have enriched, enlightened, shaped and brought great joy to my life. This is my vantage point and probably the same for all those of my generation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will share with you a story in the context of these bills. My parents were working two jobs at the time I was studying; they were looking to afford to buy a new home. The same thing was occurring in the case of my wife's parents, who are of Greek descent. They came through similar challenges and had similar values and applied themselves greatly to those tasks. Tina's father was trying to make a go of a small business in Richmond as `John PAP&hyphen;A&hyphen;KOS', and was active in the local Patra community, his home before emigrating to Australia in July 1962, where his friends called him `Ioannis PAPA&hyphen;KOS'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both families were working hard, going without and doing the best they could. These were the sorts of values that we all embraced. We were two families from different backgrounds whose paths never crossed until Tina and I met in a law class. These two families provide support, encouragement and a great deal of enthusiasm for both of us and they have a great shared belief in our dreams. We, like all Australians, are strengthened by what we share and delighted by our differences. This is my vantage point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These bills seek to reinforce the underlying principles that provide for a migration program that allows for all Australians to share a similar vantage point. These bills are part of a realignment of the migration program with the national interest. As then Minister Opperman said in that landmark speech I referred to earlier:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Every country has not only a right to its own immigration policy but a heavy duty and a vital responsibility to administer it in the interests of its own people.</PARA>
<PARA>The then member for Corio and Minister for Immigration, Mr Opperman, went on to talk about how our neighbours shape and manage their immigration programs in line with their <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8142"> own needs and self-interest and for the benefit of their own people and their own future. In migration policy, the national interest was the key under coalition prime ministers like Bob Menzies. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The coalition government wants to restore public confidence in the immigration program, while maintaining the overall intake for 1996&hyphen;97 at 74,000&mdash;not dissimilar from the average of previous years, though the skilled category is being more heavily emphasised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a sense in the community that, under Labor, ministers of the day took actions that many Dunkley residents would regard as inappropriate. Prime Minister Hawke's instant decision to grant residency rights to Chinese students present in Australia because of the Tiananmen Square massacre was a case in point. As Bob Birrell of Monash University observed in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">People and Place</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In all, the People's Republic of China nationals present in Australia before June 1989 and their relatives who arrived prior to November 1993 are expected to generate a total chain migration flow of 29,580 extra people.</PARA>
<PARA>I might add that that figure is somewhat different from the one the member for Calwell referred to. No&hyphen;one would argue that Australia should not be sympathetic to the individuals who have witnessed such unspeakable acts of brutality and persecution. However, humanitarian entry and refugee residency decisions need to involve a sober consideration of international hot spots, not mood triggered spontaneous declarations. The end result of that Labor government's failure to consult with its immigration officials&mdash;a number of whom we have with us this evening&mdash;and indeed its own backbench over the Chinese student decision has been a blow out in some migration categories, such as the issuing of fiance visas. More disturbingly, this sort of instant decision leads to other migrant groups wondering how the hardships and deprivations they experience do not qualify their nationals and their relatives or potential partners for similarly generous treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) said in his speech on the second reading of the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1996:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is Australia's sovereign right to decide the total level of immigration to Australia. It is also Australia's sovereign right to decide the balance between the various immigration categories.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the greatest indictment of Labor. It will come as a surprise to many people in Frankston and Mornington that Labor never really had the formal power to determine the number of immigrants accepted in the preferential family and other categories. Perhaps this is why immigration got out of balance. Last year the preferential family stream increased by more than 32 per cent, with the number of parents accepted rising by almost 75 per cent in a year; while a 29 per cent reduction occurred in the highly skilled independent category. None of this is good for Australia in the long-term, particularly if it is camouflaged within an overall ballooning program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition and minor party rejection of a number of important management tools contained in the regulations disallowed by the Senate serves only to strengthen the need for the measures contained in these bills before the House. The regulations provided for a more informed self&hyphen;selection process for intending migrants, which signalled key issues that realigned the program with the national interest. Rather than rely heavily on this self&hyphen;selection process to manage demand, the Senate's attitude reinforces the need for the program management tools in the proposed amendments to the Migration Act 1958.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill provides for the minister to cap various components of the migration program so as to ensure the desired balance in the program is achieved. The bill also aims to permit the minister to fix an overall maximum number of visas that may be granted in order to ensure that the aggregate number of entrants is contained within the government's national interest goals. The government is committed to a non&hyphen;discriminatory migration program. It is essential, however, that the government is able to access more flexible means to limit the number of visas that may be granted within a financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) seeks to provide the government with these very mechanisms. The behaviour of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8143"> those opposite to oppose other regulatory measures compounds the need and importance of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must recognise that migrants who do not have skills that are desired by Australian employers, including vocational English and qualifications recognised in our country, may have a bleak future. Despite Labor's claims, its administration was sloppy and poorly matched to the level of demand for occupations. For instance, in 1994&hyphen;95, 264 secondary school teachers were allowed into Australia as independent category settler arrivals. This was more than twice the 118 who entered the previous year. Yet in our country we have a large oversupply of secondary school teachers, with the exception of mathematics and science teachers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor also managed to almost double the intake of accountants over these two years from 294 to 558. That certainly did not help the Labor Party to manage its own budget dilemmas. Many of these accountants have qualifications that are unusable in Australia, but perhaps usable in the former government as it tried to manage its budget deficits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given this government's dissolution of Labor's aNiMaLS propaganda machine, why would we need 178 more public relations officers, up from the 65 two years previous? These facts give foundation to the community's concern that the previous Labor government mismanaged the program. The coalition has had to restore an emphasis to the skilled migration categories, because the unemployment rate for some non&hyphen;skills tested entrants is over 80 per cent, but for some subsets of business migrants it is under five per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Longitudinal studies have found that the unemployment rate of independent migrants who are skills tested is 11 per cent after 18 months, with nine out of 10 participating in the labour market. With a 52 per cent participation rate, preferential family entrants have an unemployment rate of 20 per cent. In 1995&hyphen;96, under Labor's migration program, five out of every eight applicants entered Australia without their skills being tested. This creates difficulties for our country as the years progress.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government's new emphasis on the skilled categories of migration will overcome some of the numerous problems created by Labor. The financial year that ended in June saw a drop of 6,300 in successful applicants accepted under skilled categories. In 1994&hyphen;95, the skilled migrant intake had comprised 39.7 per cent of all applicants. Last year, the figure fell to only 29.2 per cent, not high enough for a nation like ours which has needs in infrastructure development, in science and technology and in general research and development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only option currently available to the government to contain migration demands involves terminating lodged applications. The opportunity to queue valid applications and carry them over to future years becomes available with the passage of these bills. This is a fairer and more equitable arrangement that will avoid our posts being besieged by intending applicants at the commencement of a new intake year as if it were an offshore version of Frankston Myer's post-Christmas sale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is also determined to enhance the integrity of the migration program. The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) seeks to enforce and uphold the conditions and circumstances that permit migrants to enter this country. Again, this is a national interest and confidence building measure. As Minister Opperman said in the memorable speech which I mentioned earlier:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No responsible government condones illegality or deceit, which are poor gateways indeed for the entry of new settlers.</PARA>
<PARA>Many prospective migrants play by the rules. I pay tribute to the hardworking Italian and Greek migrants in my Dunkley electorate who arrived here legally, as I do to the 10 per cent of Dunkley by the bay's population who were born in the United Kingdom or Ireland. However, they are quite outspoken against those migrants who do not respect Australia's migration policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Take, for example, the issue of sham marriages. In a Sydney District Court case heard earlier this year, Chinese citizens who took part in arranged but completely loveless marriages of convenience have paid up to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8144"> $16,000 to immigration consultants and marriage celebrants here to defraud Commonwealth law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I stress that many marriages between Australians and foreigners are genuine and lead to happy, successful and loving relationships, the government's move to introduce a two&hyphen;year cohabitation requirement for de facto relationships will assist in rectifying a related problem. As Bob Birrell pointed out in another issue of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">People and Place</EMPHASIS> in 1995:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . (Under Labor) Australia continues with its practice (not found with any other western country) of allowing de facto spouses to be approved for permanent residence. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Evidence shows that those couples who do not marry and who apply to migrate sometimes turn out to be engaging in a false or deliberately short&hyphen;term relationship to gain entry to our country. Migrant marital breakdowns involve many costs that regrettably have to be borne by other Australians. Sadly, under Labor, high numbers of spouse arrivals from countries such as Turkey, Lebanon and Vietnam have been dependent on unemployment benefits. The minister in his second reading speech pointed to an evaluation of onshore spouse applications which highlighted the extent of relationship breakdowns during migration application processes.</PARA>

The bill proposes to extend the government's avenues to deprive citizenship where it has been obtained following fraud, without time limitations, during migration or application for citizenship.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that this measure will have overwhelming community support, not just from citizens but from both permanent and temporary residents. The latter two groups know that citizenship of any country is an honour and a privilege. The coalition seeks to restore true meaning to the pledge that new citizens give to this country.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Essentially, two changes are proposed. The first change will fold the separate health services charge and English education charge into a single, simplified visa application fee that will encompass all charges associated with the immigration process. The second change will permit the government to more fully recover the cost of visa services. This measure will significantly reduce the cross&hyphen;subsidisation of migration costs by the Australian taxpayer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If prospective migrants applied offshore under Labor, they did not have to pay any charge for English language tuition. So, not unnaturally, onshore applicants began applying offshore. The coalition government's set of bills ends this anomaly, ensuring that the English education charge is incorporated into a single visa application charge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Importantly, the bill incorporates enabling provisions for an English education charge of up to $5,500, with the details to be worked through with the development of implementation regulations. The ceiling reflects the estimated actual cost of providing language tuition to migrants who do not have functional English.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8145">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Immigration (Education) Charge Amendment Bill is sound and necessary. Both extensive argument and anecdotal evidence now show that better English language skills are of great use to both employers and employees. Migrants who take these classes show a substantial return over the years following their arrival. While migrants are unable to converse in English, they are unable to be full citizens in the real sense of the word, to function within and contribute wholeheartedly to our nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has carefully balanced this user&hyphen;pays charge introduction with an additional $17.6 million over four years for English language training through the adult migrant education program. In 1996&hyphen;97 AMEP funding is being increased to $76.3 million. Intending migrants with functional English, refugee, humanitarian and preferential clients will continue to remain totally exempt from this English education charge. The government expects that fewer than 3,000 individuals will be affected by this change, since more than nine out of every 10 individuals who receive English education through this scheme pay a concessional charge. The government's proposals do not fully recover the cost of immigration and migrant settlement services but will substantially increase the proportion of these costs funded by the direct beneficiaries. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regrettably, the member for Denison (Mr Kerr) engaged in petty politics and name calling around these matters, in vivid contrast to the constructive approach adopted by our side of the House when in opposition. Labor wants to micro&hyphen;manage the migration program and impede the government's program of sensible, practical reform and a modest reduction in the size of the program.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similar to many other aspects of migration legislation, amendments introduced by the former government with the cooperation of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this side of politics had enabling provisions which provided more flexibility and improved the management of the migration program. A constructive approach would be for those opposite to support these bills and take up any legitimate concerns when the regulations were being developed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This debate on the migration bills ends the charade and ends the double play&mdash;the two sides of the fence; telling one part of the community one story and another part of the community another story. The months those now in government spent undermining our immigration program are encapsulated quite nicely in the government's policy statement of February, which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition will also re&hyphen;establish the credibility and accountability of immigration administration and procedure to restore community confidence in its implementation.</PARA>
<PARA>The fact is that they were the ones undermining confidence. They were the ones out there day in and day out bagging migrants and migrant communities to other communities. At the same time, they were telling migrant communities a different story.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) sat with me day after day on public hearings inquiring into migrant access and equity. There would not have been a person who was more supportive of those people from overseas and who wanted more hours of English language courses provided free to people from non-English speaking backgrounds. We heard this day after day after day. It is funny how the rhetoric has changed now that he is a minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This does all come together because eventually they have to pull it together somehow. Here we are post-budget with the usual log jam of legislation. The draftsmen are too <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8146"> busy. We have legislation about doctors, for example, getting postponed for weeks and weeks because there has not been time to get it drafted. What do we find gets priority in the drafting process? What do we find jumps the queue and gets into the House in October? Legislation to limit the number of spouses who can come to Australia. This is the biggest shift in attitude to immigration that this country has seen for a very long time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government wants to say to Australians: `If you marry someone from overseas, don't be sure of living in this country.' Mind you, perhaps they cannot live in the spouse's country either. That is a huge change. Why are these migration bills so important? It is not budget legislation. These bills have nothing to do with the budget. There are no savings in here. It is simply about social engineering. It is simply about the government playing to the audience it created.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is setting out to prove that there was a rort and it is correcting it. Even the minister has the audacity to talk about fake marriages in his speech. He knows, I know and we all know that there is not one thing in these bills that will correct fake marriages. Putting a cap on spouses will not stop fake marriages, in fact it probably does the opposite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people who are cheating are probably the best informed, are in there first and know it better than anyone else. The person who will get caught by this measure will be the genuine Australian who falls in love and gets married, assuming they can bring their spouse home. That has been a reasonable assumption for all of this century. Not just since Federation or not just since 1949, but for all of this century it has been reasonable for Australians to assume that, if they marry someone, they can bring them home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard speaker after speaker opposite saying that that is a wrong assumption. `Why should anybody assume that? What is more, it is a rort.' This legislation does nothing about those who may seek to cheat. If it did, I would be in there supporting it because, as a local member, I spend a lot of my time dealing with these kinds of cases. It is important that people do not cheat.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, the word has gone out to our posts overseas. Most of us deal with our overseas posts in person, by phone or by correspondence. Now I am finding that overseas posts are advising my constituents to marry because, if they do not get married, they will not get here. That advice has been given on more than one occasion to constituents of mine who are now marrying people because they have been forced to by the department. The advisers and the department were listening, so should the minister. That is what is happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I go further to the topic of fiancees. I was advised by a post a few months back when this cap came in&mdash;and it was not my constituent&mdash;that it had a case involving a pregnant woman and it had already reached the quota for fiancees. She has to wait until next July. This is the kind of morality and attitude of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The filters are up now in a major way around the world. I was talking to Cairo a few weeks back about the brother of a businessman in Newcastle who is a Moroccan. This brother applied to come to Australia as a permanent resident a year or so back and failed because he had no hope of passing the point score. The family accepted that, but my constituent has some young children who have never met any of their family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The brother applied and my constituent gave an absolute assurance in writing that the brother would go back, that he could afford to support him and that he could afford to pay for his ticket. The brother was refused. I made a submission to the embassy outlining my knowledge of the constituent and of his reliability and credibility in the community. I was confident that that assurance would be met. The answer was very simple: `The profile of this applicant is such that he may be an overstayer; therefore, he will not succeed.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sponsor can appeal. I point out, from the sponsor's point of view, that the government is saying that his word cannot be trusted. The sponsor has said his brother will return, but the government is saying, `We don't believe you. He is the wrong profile.' The official in Cairo said, `No, we're not <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8147"> judging the sponsor; we're judging the applicant.' But who hasn't lodged the appeal? The sponsor. All over the world, in Poland, Russia, Europe, the Middle East and Asia&mdash;I have spoken to all those embassies in the last three to four months&mdash;the word is out: `Don't take a risk. Don't stick your neck out. Run the profile. No exceptions.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the past, when a parliamentarian said, `This constituent is responsible, reliable and will do what they promise to do and, what's more, we'll oppose any attempt to convert their status,' the application was always successful because they would vouch for them. That kind of reference to a constituent is not given lightly. We all understand that. But that no longer matters a damn because this government is running a different angle, a different line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why are we here tonight debating immigration? So we can reduce the number of spouses allowed under the program, so we can balance the program. Let us look at what the coalition said in February in its policy statement about the program:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our goal, wherever possible, is to reunite dislocated families. Dependents of the family unit must receive priority in our annual immigration intakes. The role, and often necessity, of the family in providing emotional and financial assistance to its members will continue to be an overriding consideration in entry.</PARA>
<PARA>The coalition said earlier in its policy statement that the immediate family unit&mdash;husband, wife, dependent children&mdash;is the primary organ of support. This is Liberal Party policy. This is not the policy of the Labor Party, the previous government. This is Liberal Party policy being put into legislation where the approval of the parliament is sought to limit the number of spouses, to limit the number of parents in the immigration program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at what that means. We will take the case of parents. We all know the rules very well. The parents have to be healthier for their age than most other people. They are the only aged people in Australia who have to pass a health test. They are prohibited from pensions for at least 10 years, and in most cases either they or their children have to have substantial means.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I dealt with a recent case involving the parents of a constituent. They brought to Australia about a quarter of a million dollars in cash and $35,000 in annual pensions, plus a lot of other assets. They will spend that money. They are buying a house&mdash;I assume they have bought it now&mdash;so they are consumers. They are spending more than $40,000 a year here. They do not require education. They do not require any services. They had to be covered for all their costs. These people are actually bringing money into the country. They are not some drain, they are not some massive liability; these people are bringing in money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But let us put a cap on them. Let us stop them. Let us play some silly numbers game. Forget the quality, forget what is involved, let us just put up the numbers and limit those parents. Let us put up the numbers for the spouses who come to Australia and who bring skills&mdash;they are still spouses&mdash;or do we try to do a double twist on independent spouses, do a skills test on spouses, and have another category altogether? What kinds of games are we playing? Why are we debating this? We are debating this because it is a priority in the government's agenda of public debate. This is part of the game to prove that the previous government was incompetent in immigration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you talk to migrant communities, you will find that they do not see a problem with the policies of the past. These are the policies that previous speakers, when in opposition, endorsed. There was bipartisanship on most of these issues. The current immigration minister spoke most vehemently about the concept of capping spouses not all that long ago. I know he has been here a lot of years, but he spoke about it in recent years, not in his first few years here. He spoke on a range of matters but mainly about human rights and, more importantly, on the issue that an Australian cannot bring their spouse back to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that we are a country of isolation. We are a small country in a very big world. We have been great travellers. Our people travel an awful lot. Successive years of migration have meant that there is even more reason to travel as people go back and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8148"> visit their families and the places their parents and grandparents came from. The idea that somehow the number of people who marry someone from overseas will increase is quite logical and natural. We are a country of migrants and travellers. It is not surprising, with the number of people coming here and the number of our people going overseas, that quite a lot of them should marry someone from overseas. The idea has always been that if you marry someone overseas you can bring them home. Now we are talking about a two&hyphen;, three&hyphen;, four&hyphen; or five&hyphen; year wait.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year I was aware of a case of a girl marrying a man in South America. Her parents in Newcastle were absolutely desperate because she would not come home unless her husband was approved. She was pregnant. They faced the prospect of their daughter having a child in an unknown hospital in an unknown town in a country they had heard of but knew little about. They went through enormous anxiety to try to get him approved in time for their daughter to come back for the baby to be born. There was a week to spare before the airline would not take her. Tell that family, `Forget it. Sorry, Ma'am, the quota's full.' What is the reason for it? To balance the program. To balance the program for whom? For independent migrants who have no family here, by this government's definition&mdash;a government that says it gives priority to families but is giving priority to strangers. Their definition of independence is that they have no-one here to sponsor them; therefore, they are independent. They take priority over those with families here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> We hear figures about unemployment, but what members do not tell us is what jobs migrants are doing. They are in work, but doing what? The minister will know what they are doing because he went through the inquiry with me. Doctors are working as gardeners or as cleaners. Let's face it, this is not the first generation where we have deskilled our migrants. The number of skilled European migrants in the late 1940s and 1950s who went to work as labourers in the factories of Newcastle was legion. The number of skilled migrants now in Australia in work but not using their skills is also le gion&mdash;architects working as draftsmen and doctors working as gardeners or trying to get work as social workers. We had witness after witness before the inquiry in the last parliament. The idea of producing numbers saying that these people are working does not tell the whole story.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the other hand, where families are bringing out their relations who pass on a points test&mdash;which, as we all know, is very tough&mdash;the chance of their getting work in their profession is much greater because they are brought into the system with someone who knows how the system works. Bringing a person from overseas with no connections, no contact, is a much surer recipe for failure as a migrant than the alternative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had this debate for some weeks now. We had the debate about immigration the other night to a farcical level. We had the minister sitting there, listening to speaker after speaker opposite absolutely misrepresenting the legislation. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) just a few weeks back claimed that the Senate's decisions meant that we on this side of the House were supporting the idea of people getting off the boat onto the dole. That expression was used last week by those opposite, speaker after speaker.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister sat here listening, knowing full well what was being done. And what was being done was to reinforce the scurrilous attacks from those opposite before the last election and since. That is why it is being debated now. That is why it got priority. It is not because it is a budget measure&mdash;which we are so short of legislation for and things will not get passed&mdash;but because it suits their purpose to have this debate. I just remind the House of a quote from recent weeks in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>. On 30 November, Mr Ramsey said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What's happening, effectively, is just another nasty version of the race debate.</PARA>
<PARA>And in the same article:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That's the way politics works, too. Now we've got new migrants to bash, along with all the other scapegoats this Government keeps coming up with to justify what's wrong with the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Who do we blame next? <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8149"> </PARA>
<PARA>A few days later, the same journalist wrote another article in a similar vein. It is of concern to a lot of thinking Australians that we are debating immigration over and over&mdash;and what for? No&hyphen;one seems to know what for. Certainly what we are debating is not in line with the government's policies at the last election. It is not in line with any other standing position that has come forward. It absolutely breaches any attempt at bipartisanship because there has been no consultation and no attempt to consult.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been no attempt to rein in the remarks of those opposite who know better. I watched the other night while people listened to what was said. They were very clear the other night that the amendments about restricting access to benefits were not being opposed for social security benefits, for jobsearch and youth training allowance. People got up over and over again and kept saying they were, yet they knew they were not. What they were doing was maintaining the fiction and the confection. It is a very nasty fiction; it is a very nasty confection; it is a very nasty version of the same race debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been surprised somewhat at the willingness of the new members of parliament to buy into this debate. They have not been here for immigration debates in previous years. To those of you were not here in 1984: go back and look at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> and see what the then shadow minister for immigration&mdash;Mr Hodgman, from Tasmania&mdash;was saying and what happened with that debate. Go back and look.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not the first time these issues have come up in this country, but this is the worst time by far. For a government to start talking about taking away from Australians the right of their spouse to join them in this country&mdash;when there is no evidence of fakery, no claim about forgery, nothing in the legislation that says that it is making the processing more rigorous&mdash;is a major change. This is not some trivial issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for not reducing the number of migrants overall&mdash;simply balancing the program, as it is called&mdash;in the minister's second reading speech there is no issue about what the proper <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> balance is. He does not say how many of each should be the balance or why. He does not say what changes the balance and what criteria he will weigh up in the balance. He simply uses these motherhood statements about balance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He is trying most of all to imply that this legislation corrects so&hyphen;called rorts. He knows that it does not. We all know it does not because there is nothing in the legislation that changes the rules about spouses. He also tried to maintain the fiction that somehow this government is fixing up immigration. What this government is doing is not fixing it; it is ensuring that immigration will be kept a matter of contention for months ahead. As the migrant community, the academic community, read <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, speak to those opposite and start to understand what this debate about, there will be an awakening and an awareness. It will not just be Alan Ramsey talking in this way; there will be many other people doing so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government can run it so far. It ran the split agenda for some months. The agenda comes together and, when it comes together, it shows: it does not fit. This government is maintaining a fiction, a very nasty fiction. Tonight and in the weeks ahead that will come to a head. This legislation is odious and should be condemned and rejected from the parliament absolutely.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to speak on these migration bills and to make some general comments on immigration that are relevant to these bills. If we go back 2&frac14; centuries in this country, Australia was 100 per cent Aboriginal. We had a wave of British migration into Australia, and the 100 per cent Aboriginal population has dropped down to about 1&half; to two per cent of the population today. We became a predominantly Anglo&hyphen;Celtic population. That varied a bit as other Europeans came in and have contributed to this country. There have been some great names: Ralph Sarich, a Croatian, and people like Arvi Parbo and the Greiner family from Hungary. In recent times there has been a modest shift towards Asian and Middle East immigration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8150">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to look back on these waves of immigration. With each group of people that came in, the ones that were already there actually resented them&mdash;and I guess that is human nature. No doubt, the Aborigines resented the British coming in originally. The British who were here probably worried about the French coming in. When those British people became, and called themselves, Australian, they were worried about the Chinese coming in in the middle of last century. In 1849, I think there were only 270 Chinese people in this country, but by 1881 that number had risen to over 38,500, of which, interestingly, only 259 were women. But the wave of Chinese people did not come to pass and the numbers dropped right back.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then, ironically, we had Australians worried about the British taking over through investment in this country. Since World War II things have not changed. There were concerns in this country about Balts and about groups sometimes, and improperly, called `wogs' and `dagos'. Fortunately, those terms are disappearing from our vocabulary. Those people have turned out to be some of our best citizens. In fact, one name in the news this week was that of David Campese. His family, undoubtedly, comes from Italy and he has turned out to be Australia's most famous international footballer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we had concerns about the Yanks, particularly with their very great investment in northern Australia. We had worries about the Japanese taking over through investment. Here I pay tribute to towns like Cowra, which, through its Japanese memorial gardens, has tended to break down that fear and prejudice in this country. Even Joh Bjelke&hyphen;Petersen&mdash;I know people have criticised him in this place&mdash;saw the value of Japanese investment. Who will ever forget Iwasaki at Yeppoon?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there was the worry&mdash;on the agenda in recent months&mdash;about other Asians coming in, particularly Vietnamese. What will we worry about in the future? My tip would be that there will be worries about the Middle East and people from there invading this country, the concern being not their colour but their different religion. Probably there also <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will be concern in the future about black Africans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a series of concerns like those but throughout it all the essential Australian character has remained and flourished, benefiting from these immigrants from all corners of the world, and I am sure that will continue to be the case. If I have a particular worry it is not so much about the immigrants; it is more about the importation of culture from the United States of America, a country I admire greatly but I do worry about its culture swamping us through television programs, et cetera.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But let's not forget that there are 175&hyphen;plus countries in the world and virtually all of them have sent people to Australia in the past. With rapid communications, rapid travel and with business contacts continually going backwards and forwards, we need mixing between the races in this country in order to flourish and survive. Australia today benefits from something like an $18,000 billion surplus from our trade with Asia. If we shut down our contact with Asia in any way, the ones who would be harmed most would be Australian farmers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was amused by a little letter I saw in one of the papers the other day from an English speaking person who was in Tahiti. He said that the taxis there had an insignia on the roof to indicate that those taxi drivers spoke English. He said that would be a marvellous thing to introduce for Sydney taxis. I guess that anyone who read that letter would have had a chuckle. It is indicative of how, in many ways, Australians of an Anglo&hyphen;Celtic background today have lost the will to work. If we do move from an Anglo&hyphen;Celtic background to a more Asian background, the fault would lie not with the Asians but with us here. The taxi example I gave is indicative, but there are plenty of others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come from a rural electorate and it is incredibly difficult to get Australian born and bred doctors to come and work in country areas. Asian people are lined up willing to go out to remote towns like Brewarrina and Wilcannia if we would let them in to work, but Australian born people are not.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8151">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Chinese seem to have a wonderful work ethic that we would do well to re&hyphen;examine. We have had some wonderful citizens in this country who have come from China. We all know about Dr Chan, but there have been others. For example, there is Richard Chee&hyphen;Quee, who often opens the batting for New South Wales. He is a very popular cricketer, possibly the hardest hitter of a cricket ball in this country. May we have more Chinese and Asian cricketers in this country. The Chinese have contributed wonderfully to our restaurant industry, and I often think that, in many country towns, if they ever went on strike, we would probably starve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was in Singapore on a brief visit a few weeks ago and it struck me there that in this country we are losing many of the values that they retain in those sorts of countries. Singapore have a land mass 0.2 per cent the size of my electorate. In that teeny country they have 2.8 million residents. They have a per capita income 33 per cent higher than we have in Australia. If you doubt that, you only have to step outside your hotel and look at all the brand new white Mercedes driving past. They have an inflation rate of 1.2 per cent. They have an unemployment rate of virtually zero. In fact, they have labour shortages in most areas. They have an overseas surplus of $130 billion. Here we are with an overseas deficit of $190 billion. They have a surplus in a country with no natural resources; they even have to get their water piped in from Malaysia. It shows how we have lost our way in this country. If we shut out these people and stop learning from them we will go further backwards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These people are small in physical stature but they are leaving us for dead. Their work ethic is quite phenomenal. It is something that we have lost in this country. Their respect for their elders is quite remarkable. They have family values, which our Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has spoken about in the past. Dare I breach a taboo subject&mdash;you could not talk about sex in the 1890s, in the Victorian era; today you cannot talk about differences between races&mdash;and look at the intelligence of these people.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The controversial book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Bell Curve</EMPHASIS>, which came out a couple of years ago, said that these people are possibly eight to 10 per cent more intelligent than we are. I do not know whether they are&mdash;you could argue incessantly about how you measure these things&mdash;but on anecdotal evidence they certainly are not behind us. We have boat people landing on these shores whose children cannot speak English but who go into our schools and, within six months, top their classes. I think we have something to learn from these people in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Asian born people who live in Australia permanently today make up only 4.8 per cent of the population. If present trends continue, in a quarter of a century's time, in the year 2021, they will be up to just over seven per cent of the population, a level that has been exceeded in many areas of Australia in the past&mdash;and I spoke about the gold rush back in the 1850s earlier in this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue of foreign investment has also been raised even as recently as in the parliament today. Some people think we should stop foreign investment in this country. Personally, I think that is the way to condemn Australia to poverty and to going backwards. We should not be banning foreign investment; we should be strengthening our economy so that we can compete with these people so that we do not need as much foreign investment as we have had to depend on in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All this leads to many lessons for us, not the least for our original citizens. The Aborigines, as I have said, have gone from 100 per cent of the population down to somewhere between 1&half; per cent to two per cent of the population, but I think we are on the verge again of the Aboriginal people having the opportunity to bounce back in this country&mdash;by that I do not necessarily mean percentage wise but in taking a much more pre-eminent position. I think there has been too much emphasis in the past on talking about the injustices of the past, as serious as those were and as much as those have to be recognised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take great heart in the attitude of the new chairman of ATSIC. We should all get behind him and the new board and build on their strengths. I think Aboriginal people are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8152"> superior in many ways. They have natural advantages with movement, art and dance. We have had some wonderful Aboriginal sportsmen in the past&mdash;the Ella brothers come to mind, Lionel Rose and people like that. There is also the innate wisdom of the Aboriginal elders, particularly amongst the female fraternity. There are great areas that we can build on, and I hope that can succeed so our mix of people in this country can change again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to look at the things proposed in this bill and see how they have evolved over the years. I was reading the biography of probably one of Australia's most famous citizens, Sir Donald Bradman, only the other day. There are now five generations of Bradmans in this country, but his grandfather came out as a 19-year-old from Suffolk in 1852. They were the gold rush days. In that year alone, 95,000 people came from England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland when the total non-Aboriginal population of Australia was barely over 405,000 people. Over 20 per cent of overseas born people of the total non-Aboriginal population lobbed into Australia in one year, 1852. It is quite remarkable. Think of the change in the debate that would generate today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Between the Second World War and today&mdash;a period of 51 years&mdash;we have had 5.4 million immigrants to this country. As the population has gone from seven million up to 18&half; million today, about six million&hyphen;odd of those were born here of that increase. If you look at 10&hyphen; and 15&hyphen;year spans, you see that migration has been pretty constant. Between 1945 and 1959, 1.4 million were immigrants. In the 1960s, a 1.3 million increase was due to immigration. In the 1970s, it was just under one million and, in the 1980s, 1.1 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The highest number of immigrants to come to Australia in a one&hyphen;year period was in 1969&hyphen;70, when 185,000 came in. The lowest period was in 1975&hyphen;76, when only 52,748 came in. Last year, 1995-96, 99,000 came in permanently. Of course, a number of Australians left the country to give us a 70,000 net increase in our population. It is interesting to contemplate that the 70,000 net who came in last year came from 150 different countries in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> total&mdash;a great enrichment, drawing on a pool of skills and cultures from all over the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today, we have quite a variety of people from all over the world. Last year, the main group that contributed was New Zealand, at 12.4 per cent of the immigrants. The United Kingdom contributed 11.4 per cent; China rated No. 3 at 11.3 per cent; Hong Kong was 4.4 per cent; India, 3.7 per cent; Vietnam, 3.6 per cent; and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was interesting that the 78,000 who came in on a temporary basis were actually business migrants who were coming out here to enrich the wealth of this country and to leave again. Our population has been increasing about one per cent to two per cent every year. I think it has been in only two recent years&mdash;1988 and 1989&mdash;where the births and deaths, the natural increase of this country, did not exceed the immigration numbers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today, of the 18.5 million people in this country, 23 per cent were born overseas. In 25 years time, on present rates of immigration, that will fall to 19.4 per cent. Our immigration policy, which has been in the news of late, is much more conservative than the one we had 150 years ago. We should not forget that. The immigration policy that we have today is proudly non-discriminatory. It is non-discriminatory on ethnic origin, sex, race and religion, but it is discriminatory in other ways, if you like, as far as health, the character of the people&mdash;whether they have a criminal record or not&mdash;skills and family migration go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has decided to cut back on the family migration aspect of immigration, and I think quite properly so. We are a sovereign nation and cannot take as many people as we like because of high unemployment. In fact, it is like this: we have decided to wind back family migration to some extent and increase the intake numbers of those who can make a definite contribution to this country, such as those with business skills. I think that is a proper way to go in formulating a migration policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many other problems that we face with immigration in this country that should be debated in the Australian population. For example, boat people have been talked about <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8153"> a lot over the last 10 or 15 years. We have to keep that in perspective. Fifty&hyphen;seven boats arrived in this country between 1980 and 1996 carrying 2,654 people. From those people that arrived on our shores, there were another 71 births. You might be interested to know that, of that total, 1,901 have been sent back, 390 have received refugee status, 34 have been let in on humanitarian grounds, 62 have bridging visas, 48 have been allowed to stay on marriage grounds, only nine have escaped&mdash;I am pleased to say that the figure is not higher&mdash;and, on the last count, 281 were still in detention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, it costs the Australian taxpayer a lot to keep those people in detention, and most of them have been in the Port Hedland area. It costs $580 a week to keep them in detention. It has cost the Australian taxpayer $39.6 million since 1992&hyphen;93. In fact, of the 1,900 that have been returned, it has cost the Australian taxpayer an average of $5,431 each to send them back. If we are sending them back on an individual basis, they are sent in a commercial aircraft with an escort, which is obviously costly. If we are sending them back in groups, we have to make special closed charter flights. So this is something that we do not want to see too much of&mdash;boat people arriving in Australia. But it is a very difficult issue because there are compassionate grounds and there are grounds whereby we just cannot let these people in willy&hyphen;nilly. I think the taxpayers appreciate that very much.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I commend the government, especially the minister, for the changes that he has brought in since he was made the minister in March, particularly the changes that we have before us tonight to discuss. The particular aspect of English language tuition classes of one entitlement per person for 510 hours is something that we should all look at very carefully indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When these bills, hopefully, go through not only this House but also the Senate we will have a more balanced migration program. We will have more educated migrants and we will have migrants that can make a better contribution to the Australian population. They will be able to enjoy their lives here better and they <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will be able to make a greater contribution to this great country of ours.</PARA></SPEECH>

We heard in this chamber a few weeks ago a speech by President Clinton in which he praised this country for its attitude to multiculturalism. President Clinton said that he thought that that was the way to go for the world and that we were, in fact, a good example to the rest of the world. Parts of Australia like my electorate are probably very good examples of how we are an example to the rest of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Forty per cent of the constituents in my electorate come from a non-English speaking background. The city of Canterbury, which is within my electorate, is made up of people from 132 different nationalities. It is those very migrants who have chosen this country as their home who will be affected, unfortunately, by the provisions that we are debating here tonight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While there are many reasons for opposing the bills before us, there are two that particularly concern me. The first is the proposal to limit the number of spouses, aged parents and dependent children visas that can be granted in one year, and the second is the increase in the English language charge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ever since the 1940s Australia's policy on immigration has had bipartisan support in this House, and that is what allowed the program to grow and prosper. We started out with a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8154"> populate or perish policy in the 1940s, and that has evolved to one which, under the Labor government, attempted to be a balance of skill, family reunion and business migration in a comparatively small program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Parkes mentioned that there was a net gain of about 70,000 immigrants last year. That is not a country being overtaken, as some other members of this House would have us believe in some of the more rabid speeches that we have heard on these bills earlier today. Seventy thousand is a modest number of people to add to a growing country like  Australia. A very important part of that balanced program has allowed us to see families come here to be reunited with the rest of their families and help themselves through the maze of settlement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bipartisan approach which we have had in the past was never better illustrated than in the era of the Fraser government, when the Liberal Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs in that government, Ian Macphee, and shadow minister Mick Young both actively campaigned in favour of Australia supporting the intake of Asian refugees. We took in 90,000 refugees under the refugee program that those two gentlemen campaigned for. It was a hard thing for them to convince some of their colleagues of. In the end, I think it was something that we, as people living in this part of the world, had an obligation to do. We also had an obligation to do that for humanitarian reasons that we as a well&hyphen;fed, wealthy, developed country recognised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, we have seen the bipartisan support that we had in the 1970s and 1980s, right back to the 1940s, severely tested in recent times. It seems that the government is content to use some of the jingoistic and anti-migration campaigns that are being mounted by some people as a smokescreen for its own efforts, which will see migrants, unfortunately, if some of the things in this bill are successful, pushed into an underclass in Australian society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the member for Parkes said earlier, immigration has helped to make Australia more culturally diverse, more tolerant and a more optimistic and forward looking society. He mentioned the importance of Asia to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australia as a market for our farm products. It would be interesting to understand that, for farmers, that market is becoming more important. Without that market, there would be a reduction in the standard of living of all of us in this country. Economic arguments aside, the fact that this diversity is good for us is enough to justify the contributions that migrants have made to Australia's national interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Migrants generate more demand for goods and services which, in the end, creates more employment opportunities than the number of jobs which new migrants can fill. So, out of migration into Australia, there is a net plus in jobs. It is just wrong for people to think that migration takes away jobs from Australians. The reality is that most new migrants tend to do the jobs that people who are already living in this country will not do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most telling examples of that was some years ago, when I visited a factory&mdash;it was in my electorate then but is now in the electorate of the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese), down at south Marrickville&mdash;which was a big forge shop. It was a dirty place, with noise and dust and heat. The people who ran that factory said that you could tell who the latest wave of migrants were, because they were the only people who would do this hard, dusty, unclean work. They said that, if they had to rely on people staying in those jobs for a long while, they would have to close that business, and that was a very big exporting business for Australia. The people who manned the forge works, which was the central characteristic of that business, were those in the latest wave of migrants. So to say that immigrants take the jobs of Australians is pretty silly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Immigration is also important to improve the quality of life of those of us who live in this country. Living in a multicultural environment enriches all the population groups in that environment. With multiculturalism comes an exposure to other people's thoughts, language and food. As I said earlier, all of that creates economic benefit for Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At a meeting of the Advisory Council on Multicultural Affairs in 1987, then Prime Minister Bob Hawke said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8155">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has been immeasurably enriched by the contribution of immigration to our national life and by the success of the immigration program. It is one of our nation's greatest achievements that people have been accepted from a wide and diverse range of backgrounds, race, religion and culture.</PARA>
<PARA>I think Australia can look the world in the face and say&mdash;and people in my electorate are a living example of this&mdash;that people have come from countries all over the world and they have put aside their differences here. They have put aside their differences very quickly. In my electorate, we have people from Cyprus, both Greeks and Turks, living in the same street but not arguing with each other like they would have been in Cyprus. You have people from Lebanon of both the Christian and the Muslim faith living in the same streets and sending their children to the same schools, but not fighting with each other and killing each other like they would have been in Lebanon a few years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia was one of those very significant examples of how people could live together, even 100 years ago. There is one great rift in the Anglo-Saxon culture that people do not talk about so much in this country but, for people who live in Europe and in Ireland in particular, it is blatantly obvious that the Irish were busy killing each other for hundreds of years in that country. When the Irish and the English came to Australia, they managed to find enough space in this country so that that never happened. There was prejudice, but there was not bloodshed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think space and the fact that Australians are a lot more tolerant and easy going probably has something to do with why we have been successful. Because we have a short history as a country, we probably do not have the prejudices of the old world ingrained into us. Rather than be afraid of immigration and rather than be afraid of other cultures&mdash;and some people seem to be trying to whip this up at present&mdash;we should be sensible and embrace them, because that diversity makes all of us better. It makes for a much more interesting, a much more outgoing and, I think, a much more successful country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both sides of the political fence in this country have said the unifying effect of our immigration program was that people should <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> accept that we have a common language of English in this country and that immigrants should be willing to commit themselves to the importance of living here. They should put aside some of the problems of their homeland, happily share their culture with us and help to make Australia a better place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, this legislation goes against that in a couple of ways. It strikes very much at the concept that immigrants should take on the language of Australia, which is English. In the past, we heard many members of the government say that English language skills were very important. The government proposes to do some good things through this legislation. They intend to spend an extra $17 million on English language programs over four years. That is reasonable. But it is no good spending extra money if you are then going to increase the costs of the program by over 100 per cent for those people who are going to use it. It is like saying, `Look, we're going to open this nice new school for people who wish to learn English in this country but it is now going to cost you twice as much to get in the door.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In dollar terms, the fee for English language programs will rise from $2,205 to $5,500. An interim rise to $4,405 occurred on 1 October this year. I do not think there can be any stronger deterrent to new settlers learning English than more than doubling the fee. It is ludicrous for the government to say, `We want all new arrivals to speak English and we want them to learn English but now we're going to charge them twice as much.' It militates against the idea of language being something that binds us together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have received many letters from people in my electorate who have been attending language classes and who are now finding it very difficult to pay the fees. One letter was from a woman called Gilma Ramirez, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am interested in continuing with my English classes as I have found that my improvement in this language is of great benefit in my day to day communication with the Australian Community. If I have the opportunity of continuing with my English classes, I am sure my future in this country can be successful. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8156"> </PARA>
<PARA>Another person wrote and said the advantage from learning English was that it would help them to get a job. They did not believe they would be able to get a job&mdash;in order to keep their family together&mdash;without being able to understand English, but they said the cost of the classes was becoming prohibitive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How can these people have any prospect of being successful and of having a future in this country if their access to English language programs is affected by the cost? The sum of $5,500 is a great deal of money when you consider that most people starting out in a new land&mdash;if they are lucky&mdash;are earning $25,000 to $30,000 a year and of that they will only receive around $20,000 only after tax. If they have to pay a quarter of their income to learn English, that seems to go against what the government says it wants to achieve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have met many migrants who have settled effectively in Australia and who have said that good English language skills were very important for them. But the government wants to make it very hard for people to access those programs. Earlier this year, I was fortunate to present the Australian student prize for academic achievement to a number of young people who live in my electorate. The four students that I presented with the prize were either migrants themselves or children born of migrants. Those students were of Vietnamese, Korean, Chinese and Italian parentage. They were a shining example of what an immigration program is about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In many ways, an immigration program is about helping to make the children of immigrants the shining future of this country. Immigrants&mdash;whether they come from England, Scotland or Vietnam&mdash;often bring with them some baggage from their homeland. But in the years that I have lived in the inner west of Sydney, which is one of the largest immigrant receiving parts of this country, I have found the children of immigrants to be the ones that highlight the great benefit of the immigration program. I thought these four young people were shining examples of how that program had worked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> One of those students, Katherine Lieu, arrived in Australia as a refugee from Viet nam in 1979. She came here as a little girl. Now, some few years later, she is studying medicine at the University of New South Wales. It is people like Katherine who show that this program has been a great success because, by giving immigrants skills in English, they can empower themselves and be of benefit to Australia. English language ability is certainly a very important determinant in getting a job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that the government has put up the price of learning English is already starting to show up in unemployment figures. In September 1996, the unemployment rate in New South Wales was 8.1 per cent. However, when you looked at those figures, the unemployment rate for people from a non-English speaking background was 11.4 per cent as opposed to 6.2 per cent for people who speak English as their native language. Now that we have doubled the charges, the number of people proficient in English will go down and those unemployment figures will go up. The government should not really pat themselves on the back for this measure; they should really admit that they have made a mistake.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other matter that I think is wrong with these bills is the cap that has been put on family migration. All of us who live in this country would believe that one of the better ways to help immigrants become accepted and build their lives here is if they have the support of family members and if they do not have the stress of worrying about family members who might be left in the country of their homeland and who wish to come to live here with them. For the government to put an arbitrary level on the number of people who can sponsor their parents, children, spouses or fiancees to come to Australia, I think is really getting in the way of ordinary people's lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8157"> Here you have a government that says they are pro&hyphen;family. Every day we hear the Treasurer (Mr Costello) raving on in here about their family tax package&mdash;their family this, their family that and their family something else. Liberal governments in the past used to wrap themselves in the jingoism and patriotism of the flag. This lot are doing that, but they are also trying to wrap themselves up in Australian families. It would seem that fami lies are all right with this government if they live here and were born here. But if part of your family comes from overseas you are not the family we want. We are going to say to you, `You have got to get in a long queue.' So parents are going to have to worry about their children; husbands are going to have worry about their wives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had the ludicrous situation in the last few weeks in my electorate where people have been refused permanent residence applications for their spouses. We have the Australian government saying, `We are going to let half of the family here and not the other half.' Then they say, `Isn't it terrible that people are getting divorced?' It is just absolutely bizarre. The government should really reconsider some of these things. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in support of the coalition's 1996&hyphen;97 migration program. It is a program to be implemented by a combination of administrative, regulatory and legislative measures. I believe that the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1996, the Migration (Visa Application) Charge Bill 1996 and the Immigration (Education) Charge Amendment Bill 1996 that we are debating today make good economic sense, restore integrity to this vital public policy arena, are socially responsible and maintain Australia's commitment to a sustainable immigration program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After listening to the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay), I certainly applaud his agreement for the diversity of our migration program and the benefits it has created for Australia. As a migrant, I thank him for those comments. I also got the feeling that he was searching hard, deep down to find something to criticise in the program&mdash;more political than of substance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My major concern is not so much with the honourable member for Watson but with the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) and the comments he made earlier this evening about referring this bill to the United Nations for breaching sexual discrimination guidelines. I am concerned about that for a very important reason. We talk about politicising debate in this country, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> about bipartisanship for our migration program and about racial acceptance. I believe that the member for Calwell must seriously think about his actions and his comments and the implications that they have for Australian society. Does he really want to give those who are sceptical, fearful, intolerant and have a lack of understanding for the diversity of our immigration program an excuse to band together&mdash;a forum to attack and create even greater division? That is exactly what the member for Calwell will be doing if he pursues this course of action. I also say to him that many countries out there have the same requirements for cohabitation and de facto spouse arrangements. We are not alone in this measure; in fact, we are one of a number of countries in the Western world with this arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The migration legislation Bills is about a number of issues which I would like to refer to. It is about rolling the health services and English services charge into one visa application fee. It is about an entitlement to 510 hours of English language tuition to a level of functional proficiency. Nowhere does it say that the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs should be providing English tuition to a level where the new immigrant can be fully competent in English. DEETYA then has the responsibility of helping the new immigrant find a job. The responsibility of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs is simply to bring the person to a level of functional proficiency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bills also provide the minister with greater flexibility to cap various components of the program, including the preferential family category. There is nothing wrong with this. It is simply an extension of the capping provisions. It is a vital provision considering that under Labor the preferential family program, which was set at 42,000, blew out to 52,000 simply because of the spouse component. Unless we have that provision, which allows the minister to cap the preferential family category, we could very well see that happen again. If that happens, where do the numbers come off? The Labor Party took them off in the business skills category.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8158">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bills are about the power to determine the number of visas that may be granted in any one year. They introduce, as I mentioned before, a two&hyphen;year cohabitation period for applicants who apply for offshore migration on the basis of a de facto or interdependency relationship with an Australian citizen or resident. They are about citizenship fraud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issues raised by this legislation, as well as those recently rejected by the Senate, go to the heart of the debate which is raging in this country at present. Most of us understand that an immigration program of high integrity not only is expected by the wider community but lies at the heart of our Australian heritage and is part of our national identity. It is important to demonstrate to those who are sceptical, fearful and ignorant of immigration that the short&hyphen;term impact of immigration is minimal and that the long&hyphen;term positive effects are great. In order to convince the immigration sceptics, it is vital that we include in our program a sizeable number of skilled immigrants, which this year has been set at 28,000 compared with the previous year's 23,600.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These skilled immigrants are people who can deal with the challenges of finding work in Australia without being a burden to the system. This bill will offer such assurances to most Australians. Once again, we are not alone in this measure. On 30 October, the Canadian Immigration Minister, Lucien Robillard, said in a statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many Canadians were not ready to accept increased numbers of immigrants even though the country could handle tens of thousands more. . . Right now the Canadian population is divided according to the last poll we had.</PARA>
<PARA>There is something very similar in the Canadian experience to what is happening here in Australia. The minister then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . while immigrants benefit the economy and do not take jobs from residents, many Canadians think otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have to demonstrate to the Canadian people that this is a myth. . . But I have to recognise the myth is there. . . We need the support of the population.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the situation confronting us here in Australia. We have to confront the myth. We have to face the population and get their <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> support on the immigration program. We have to achieve a balance and achieve integrity in the program, and that requires the support of all parties in a bipartisan manner&mdash;rather than trying to make political points, rather than threatening to go to the United Nations and rather than adding fuel to the fire that currently exists in those fringe elements in our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition has publicly indicated its support for the size of the 1996-97 program. I welcomed this initial support and believed it to reflect a genuine belief that immigration should not be a party political issue. The government's proposal is after all about maintaining the levels of immigration established under the previous Labor government. The 1996-97 intake will be 74,000, a slight decrease compared with the previous year's intake of 83,000. However, the intake is substantially more than the 1993-94 intake of 62,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is nothing the opposition should find in any way offensive in this year's program. The total levels reflect the normal ebb and flow of immigration numbers. It maintains the commitment to non-discriminatory principles and universal criteria. Above all, the emphasis moves towards the skills categories. This is a bill which will benefit all of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also well known that the previous Labor government allowed Australia's migration program to spiral out of control. As a result, it lost some important components&mdash;those components being balance and integrity in the eyes of the Australian population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The family stream of the Labor government's immigration program grew by 27 per cent in 1995-96, coming to constitute almost 70 per cent of the immigration program. Let us bear in mind that the current government does take its responsibility to the family&mdash;as the member for Watson said&mdash;very seriously. That also includes the family reunification program. I am personally convinced that this program is extremely important to the long-term stability of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, we cannot deny the harsh reality of the family immigration programs under the Labor government. Under Labor, the preferential family component did blow out. It became <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8159"> an increasingly large part of the immigration program. If left unchecked, the migration program for 1996-97 would have reached an unacceptably high level of 100,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, anecdotal evidence suggested that the family schemes were leading to levels of unemployment in certain communities that were unacceptably high&mdash;unacceptably high for any community in Australia. We owe more to those migrants than simply offering them a potential environment of despair where high levels of unemployment may exist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is for this reason that I would like to emphasise the integrity and balance that Australia must uphold in its immigration program. Those coming to our country must have a reasonable chance of obtaining work and finding ways to support themselves and their families in a dignified way. There is nothing more undignified than coming out here and being shackled to a welfare system when your dreams and aspirations have been blown out the window.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is, I believe, a compassionate philosophy&mdash;one which says that our commitment to immigrants does not end the moment they have a successful application. They are given a fair chance of succeeding in their new home. Success is good for their families and good for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under no circumstances should this bill be construed as a lack of commitment to family reunion. Of the 74,000 people who will immigrate in the 1996-97 period, 36,000 will still be in the preferential family program, 8,000 in the concessional family category and 28,000 in the skilled scheme. The government is suggesting a new emphasis on skilled migration, an emphasis which I believe will lead to a greater social cohesion and restoration of faith and goodwill by resident Australians to our new immigrants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those sceptical of the long-term benefits of immigration will find little comfort in this bill. Unfortunately, there appears not to be a great deal we can do to persuade these people that immigration is in the long-term interest of this country. But a unified approach from both parties would certainly go a long way.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, in response to the current public debate, the Asian immigration figures, which have been provided to me by the Department of the Parliamentary Library, show that business and professional migrants from Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and Indonesia are, in general, English speaking and more highly qualified than the average Australian. In professional managerial positions, they earn above average incomes. These people are providing a real benefit to Australia. While in 1985-86 they comprised 35 per cent of all settler arrivals, in today's terms they represent around 40 per cent of all settler arrivals. The Australian population has certainly benefited from a non-discriminatory immigration program which emphasises the need to open our gates to our Asian neighbours as well as out more traditional source countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those sceptical of our program should also come to realise, as the member for Watson stated, that these immigrants do contribute to Australia and to its success. Immigration actually stimulates the economy. Every new person brought to this country is a consumer as well as a worker.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, when my family arrived out here, they had nothing. They had nothing at all, and what did they do when they came here? They were consumers. They were workers. They bought a house, a fridge, a washing machine, a TV set, furniture, a lawn mower and a couple of cars, eventually. Where did all this come from? The answer is that my family's possessions came from Australian businesses and Australian industry. It also came from sheer hard work and the perseverance of their dream of establishing a life in their new country. In many cases an Australian worker built the appliances, an Australian retailer sold those appliances and an Australian builder built their house. They also contributed to this country through having skills which were necessary in this country at that stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should direct the attention of those sceptical or fearful of immigration to the Canadian experience&mdash;a country with a population comparable to that of Australia, in which the immigration target is between <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8160"> 195,000 and 200,000 in 1997. This is a country with one of the highest standards of living. The most prosperous area of Canada&mdash;the Western Provinces&mdash;are the most popular destinations of immigrants, many of them from Asian countries. We all know that immigration attracts prosperity. Let us hope it can continue within the framework of an intelligent immigration policy. That is what this bill will provide, and that is what I am supporting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government understands that economically this country has everything to gain from immigration, and the bill that we are debating today continues the tradition of recognising the importance of a strong, non&hyphen;discriminatory immigration policy. It is important, however, to demonstrate to those who have no faith in immigration that the government's policy is firm. It is about balance, it is about restoring the wider community's confidence in the program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important also that Australia communicate to prospective immigrants that they must be serious in their application to come to Australia. They must harbour no doubt that they truly have something important to contribute to this nation. I believe that the increase in the visa fee will ensure that those applying to come to live in Australia are quite determined to go through with their applications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The offshore migration fee is to be increased by $40 in this financial year, then by an extra $400 the next. The onshore family residence fee is to increase by $185 this year, by $900 the next, and so on. This will lead to an increase in revenue over the next four years, providing the necessary legislation is passed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that we communicate to the world that Australia is indeed serious about economic recovery&mdash;a recovery that has been thrust upon this government because of the inadequacies of the previous 13 years of Labor government. I believe this bill does send a strong message to the world that Australia is an economically sound place to emmigrate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The good news is that the current reduction in visa applications has led to the cap on two visa classes within the preferential family <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> category being raised. The cap on fiance visas will be raised from 1,500 to 3,000 places. The cap on independent visas granted onshore will be raised from 200 to 300 places. This indicates that government policy is working in this area, and the 14 per cent fall in application rates for the preferential family category, in the first quarter of 1996&hyphen;97, allows the government greater scope of raising the capping threshold. It creates that integrity that I was talking about earlier and that balance that is widely sought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill is also indicative of the government's intention to get tough with applicants who do not deserve to be admitted into Australia. The government will improve screening procedures with respect to the entry into Australia of possible war criminals, people associated with organised crime, or `gang' members. Future applicants will be required to give an additional undertaking that they have not committed or participated in war crimes, atrocities or crimes against humanity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will also strengthen the enforcement of the provisions for the revocation of visas where they have been obtained as a result of fraudulent or false declarations. The Citizenship Act will be amended, where necessary, to allow the revocation of future grants of citizenship, where such citizenship was granted as a result of a material false declaration made or a demonstrable fraud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8161"> There is nothing draconian or unfair about these new measures. It really comes down to the type of person we want to see working and living in Australia. In the case of those who do not meet basic standards of honesty and decency, we have a right as a government, as a population, to prefer other people to take their place in a very, very long queue. The government has also decided that only Australian citizens will be able to sponsor people under the preferential family category. The right to sponsor family members to become part of Australian society is a privilege that should be available to only those who have made a public commitment to Australia by becoming an Australian citizen. There is nothing sinister about this requirement, certainly no hidden conservative agen da, no pandering to the populist view. There is simply a need to recognise a level of commitment to Australia's people and Australia's principles of democracy by those who are planning to assist other people in coming to this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by adding that, in the recent debate on immigration, I have disagreed with those who claim that the level of Asian immigration is too high. There is simply no foundation to the claim that Australia is swamped by Asians. Currently 4.5 per cent Australia's population is of Asian descent. By the year 2031 Asian Australians will comprise about 7.5 per cent of our population. I refer once again to notes from the parliamentary library which say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the most recent wave of immigrants, Asians, along with people from Middle Eastern countries, are currently the most `different'. However, by the second and third generations, most migrant groups have integrated into the broader society, and the issue of ethnic ancestry has an individual rather than a broader social focus.</PARA>
<PARA>I ask those who are sceptical and those who are fearful to put those fears aside and come to accept the migration program of this government. I ask that the opposition take a bipartisan stance in order to dispel the views of those out there who want to discredit Australia's diversity of culture and its ethnic make&hyphen;up.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have listened with some interest to the contributions of the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Barresi) and the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Billson). There are certain clear and apparent truths in this area of immigration. They are that basically there has been a bipartisan policy operating out of this parliament for many years. But that does not mean that there will not always be arguments, both within parties and across the benches of this parliament, on what should be the level of immigration and what categories should operate within the framework of that policy. It is a matter of some regret to hear words like `racist' being bandied around in terms of the detail of that argument.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to the honourable member for Dunkley that I do not believe there is a debate going on in this country in terms of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Asian immigration. We have got one member of this parliament, speaking largely out of ignorance, without any understanding of the complexities of immigration policy, who does not understand the way in which that policy has been developed over the years. In most cases she is speaking without facts and with blind prejudice. She has received a level of publicity to which I do not believe she is entitled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not feel warmly towards those newspapers, because many very impressive maiden speeches have been made by members on both sides of the House. The contribution by the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) was barely worth reporting, but it has been sensationalised by the press. They want to run every stupid thing she says and then moralise in their editorial column, saying how terrible it is. It is time that some responsibility was shown by newspaper editors. Their responsibility to contribute to the development of a bipartisan policy is no less than the responsibility of each individual member.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will always be this argument that is taking place now about the way in which the policy is being enforced. It is regrettable, but I think understandable, given the nature of this institution, that the two speakers from the government side who preceded me in the debate described the policies of the former Labor government as having blown out the emphasis on family reunion. I have no doubt that, in the case of those two members, if a Russian, an Italian or a Chinese citizen walked into their office tomorrow and said, `We're doing reasonably well but we want to bring out our mother from our homeland,' they would not say, `She's not really productive, she's too old.' In my view, they would try to assist them. They would talk to officers of the department, who apply objective criteria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) knows, there are officers working in embassies throughout the world who are under incredible pressure, who are working in posts which are described, to the minister and within the department, as hardship posts. The queues are very long outside many of our embassies. The <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8162"> great majority of applicants who come before them are given summary examinations and many of them do not succeed. To talk about a blow&hyphen;out, quite frankly, does not make any serious contribution to this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Equally, some of the views that have been expressed to the effect that that can simply be dismissed as racist do not contribute to the debate. I have known the minister for many years. We have served on many committees together, including the Aboriginal affairs committee and the immigration committee. We have not always agreed; we have sometimes bitterly disagreed. But I could never say of him that he has expressed on any occasion a view that could be described as racist. I would reject any assertion that that is any aspect of the policy that he formulates or carries out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the broader issues have been fairly fully covered in this debate. I am concerned about the reputation of this government&mdash;and, indeed, any government&mdash;in terms of our immigration policy. I was concerned to meet in my office two young Russian citizens, both highly technically qualified, who have come to Australia. They have a small child. Their application had been approved in 1995, their visas were issued in 1996 and they arrived on 1 April.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 1 April, there was no decision by this parliament to say to those people that they were not entitled to assistance to settle in Australia. When they arrived, because they had spent all their money getting to Australia, they applied for a special benefit, and it was refused. It was not refused on the basis of any decision made by this parliament or by the government. I find it hard to believe that the Department of Social Security would have made the decision that they did. Everybody knew the direction in which the government was heading, but no bill had gone through this parliament. Yet they were refused social security benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On what basis? It was on the basis, perhaps, of a discussion between the relevant minister and his permanent head, because existing policy is still in place and will stay in place until this parliament reverses those policies. The debate that we are having now is part of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that process. So a decision was made in respect of two young people&mdash;admirable settlers to Australia, both highly qualified&mdash;who had to secure accommodation with friends. I advised them to appeal to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. Of course, having gone through the process, the department had to concede that there was no basis for the decision made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have heard speeches made in this parliament about the way in which we have a duty to see that immigrants who come here learn English and that they understand our traditions and philosophies. Although many of the people who come here cannot speak English, they are going to make a contribution to our country in the future; there is no doubt about that. This case is a perfect example of people who come here with rights and entitlements, but a decision is made on the basis of what is predicated to be government policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If these changes are to take place, then there is no point telling people who do not speak English after they arrive that they do not have an entitlement. If these changes ultimately become law, there should be no action by any level of government which predicates the decision of this House or of the Senate. In my view, that is almost contempt of this parliament and contempt of the processes of this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe those decisions could have been made without the authority of the minister. If they were made without the authority of the minister, then someone in the bureaucracy has got a very serious problem on their hands if the minister acts as he should act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are going to make these changes, the important thing is that those things are explained, particularly in those countries where there are massive numbers of people wanting to come here. We ought to tell them in their own language so that they understand the range of problems they will confront, if they pass the test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is great tension within migrant communities in my electorate because the government, in its anxiety to deal with some of the problems that exist at the moment, is approaching this almost like a sledgehammer. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8163"> It is evident in this debate&mdash;`everything the previous Labor government did was wrong'. The honourable member for Dunkley talked about sham marriages and about the rorts that existed in the system. Of course they existed.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CH4">Mr HOLDING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I bet you have got actual cases, but he acted as if all were well in Dunkley. He did not have those problems in Dunkley. He would not get up in Dunkley and say that someone down the street had been involved in a sham marriage. He acted as if all were well in the multicultural community which he represents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He also talked about his own background. I accept all of that. But, while he enjoys and responds in a positive way to the multicultural nature of his community, he also gets up here on a party political basis and says, `While all is well and I really enjoy this society, I am also bound to say how terrible it is that the figures have blown out.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He also talked about the decision made by the former Prime Minister Bob Hawke. There was no doubt that that caused real concern within the department, but it was not raised in this parliament. It was open to the then Leader of the Opposition and to members of the National Party and the Country Party to move a vote of no confidence. Did they? They were perfectly happy, given the tension that existed around that situation and given the sympathy that existed out in the broad community, to sit quietly on the opposition benches and hope the matter would resolve itself. Now, some years later, they come in here and say that was a really rotten decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we look at the development and the history of our immigration policy, no party can claim that it and some of its members have always been on the right side of this debate. The member for Dunkley talked with some pride about Hubert Opperman and was right when he said that he was a great Minister for Immigration, but so was Arthur Calwell.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Arthur Calwell brought survivors of the holocaust to Australia, there were venomous articles written about that decision in the then <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> and a letter was written by a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Liberal member of parliament which said that Jews really did not have any place in Australian society, they could not fit in, they had a different religion, they were not part of our culture and they should be excluded. I could show these articles to the honourable member for Dunkley if he is interested in seeing them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The development of our policy has had these sorts of problems not only in the broad community but within our own political structures. It is important as we now approach this problem with a different perspective to understand that there have been very few ministers for immigration who have not had as much responsibility in the decision making process and faced the same range of problems as the now minister for immigration has.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not add anything to this debate by looking at the history of immigration and saying, `We have got a problem now because of all the things that happened under a Labor government over that long period of office. Let the whole process go to rack and ruin.' The fact is that all ministers for immigration carry a great burden and a great responsibility. In most cases they get it right and, from time to time, they are subject to uninformed criticism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a level of racial hatred being developed in this country and the member for Oxley has to take responsibility for that. It is very easy to get a meeting of 300 or 400 people who share her views&mdash;the League of Rights will organise one. I have challenged her to a debate. If she wants a debate, I have said, `Any time, any place and anywhere in Australia.' It will not be accepted. So we should not honour in any way at all what is occurring in Australia as being part of the debate. It is not part of the debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The right of free speech, in my view, does not include the right to make hurtful and derogatory comments of any group of people who have come to settle in Australia and to say that they threaten our way of life when there is no evidence for that. It certainly does not include uninformed ignorant comments which are designed to build up a body of prejudice against new settlers in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have said it before and I will say it again: the history of immigration in Australia is that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8164"> the last group off the boat receives most of the criticism. That, I suspect, will continue to be the history no matter who has the responsibility for administering and developing immigration policy. In the difficult days that lie ahead, I wish the minister well in what is a difficult and complex portfolio.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise with pleasure to follow the member for Melbourne Ports, Clyde Holding, in the debate on the migration bills. I say to the House tonight that I do not come to this place with the passion the member for Deakin (Mr Barresi) displayed, the experience the member for Dunkley (Mr Billson) has with his approach to this issue or the depth of experience and wisdom the member for Melbourne Ports, Clyde Holding, has.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a pleasure to be in the House and to see two new members of parliament&mdash;Teresa Gambaro, the member for Petrie, and Phillip Barresi, the member for Deakin&mdash;sitting here chatting. I wonder whether their parents ever dreamed that one day Teresa Gambaro and Phillip Barresi would hold office in the parliament of Australia&mdash;the country they came to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We raise this debate at a time when, as the member for Melbourne Ports has outlined, the broad community is facing some difficulty. I was recently called to a meeting of concerned citizens of Pakenham&mdash;it turned out to be not quite the concerned citizens of Pakenham&mdash;and there were 70 people there when I thought there would be seven people. I tell you the story because we still run a small business in an outer Melbourne area in part of my electorate. It was a very difficult night for me because a number of people in that room actually came from my church, came from my town, came from my community, and they were raising a whole lot of issues that were certainly not ones I supported.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would have been easy for me, in a marginal seat, just to roll over and agree with everything they said. But I could not, because I represent a multicultural community. There ain't no difference in the blood that runs in the veins of the people who live in the streets of Pakenham, Traralgon, Morwell, Moe or any of the townships in my area. As the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> member for Melbourne Ports said, we do have some disagreement, we do have some arguments, on this issue. We do have differing views within parties and with the opposition parties. A number of issues have been raised tonight about opposition parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I found myself having to stand my ground at that meeting the other night. It was a great pleasure that in the ensuing week, after I thought I had had a pretty tough time with those people, people from the meeting actually came into my wife's place of business and said, `Look, we didn't go to that meeting to support your husband, but we are very proud of the way that he defended himself on the issues on behalf of his party and the approach that they were taking.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not come tonight to pat anybody on the back but to say this. I have known the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) for some seven or eight years. I came back into the parliament and found him in a very responsible position, having to respond not only to the program put to the people before the last election but also to the position that he finds himself having to deal with now he has been given the facts of the situation. I have watched him quietly and with compassion. He has listened and sought out the views of many people, including the backbench, by the way, which is different. He has put a point of view and has put that into legislation, in a deliberate fashion, which reflects the influence he has gained in the short time that he has been the minister. I thank him for that because it is a most difficult issue. As I said, he went about it quietly. No voice has been raised by the minister or any of us on this side of the House on this issue, yet voices have been raised on the other side. That is disappointing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The member for Deakin had some passion and concern not only for his community but for the broader Australian community. My disappointment, though, comes with the member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay), who, when he ran out of his written speech, had to say that everything we were putting forward was bizarre. For heaven's sake, I know the member for Watson would have been very keen to introduce a number of the reforms <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8165"> that have been introduced in this bill. We have gone out of our way to be compassionate and to bring forward a sustainable migration program&mdash;knowing that it needed some reform&mdash;that is acceptable to the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yes, you are right, we all have instances where people have been out of order. But is that not the same for every issue that comes before this parliament&mdash;that there are people who tend to rort the system, that there are people who do step out of line, that there are people who do the wrong thing? Should this issue be any different? I do not think so. In fact, I am sure that is not the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Mr Deputy Speaker, in accordance with your normal wishes, I will come to the substance of the bill in a few moments. But, if I can just take a minute, the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris)&mdash;I have known him for quite a while&mdash;called for a balanced program. I believe we have put in place a balanced program. We set out to put in place a balanced program that is acceptable to the community. We do have policies that affect the family. What disappointed me was that he had no yardstick. His whole approach in his speech to the parliament was that there was no yardstick, no limit. He never suggested a limit; he never suggested an appropriate outcome. He just went through all the downside. He talked about, as members do, `the one case I had last year' or `the particular case I had last year'. The legislation has to address the whole of the issue, not `the one case'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is disappointing that someone who is as experienced and has worked on as many committees as the member for Newcastle made remarks about not attending to the yardsticks and the limits that we have to put in place. It is our sovereign right, actually, to put those yardsticks in place. This is our Australia. We make the rules, and that is what we are here for. We are in government and we intend to make the rules on behalf of the nation, because there is feeling in the community&mdash;rightly or wrongly&mdash;that the former government did not get it right. And the new government rightly has an opportunity to address itself to those issues.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come to the remarks of the member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), who just about broke my heart, knowing his passion and concern for this issue. I get very displeased when he stands up and says, `You are speaking to an expert on this issue.' Everybody is an expert on this issue and every other issue in this parliament. And he was wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former government were rejected because they said, `If you can't do it in this country, we are going to send it off to the United Nations'&mdash;for heaven's sake! The member for Calwell said, `If you don't do the right thing here, we'll send it off to the United Nations. We will get you on discrimination.' Yes, discrimination, or discernment? We want to discern what is right for our country, what gives the people that do come here the best opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not care whether you happen to be Croatian, Serbian, Polish, Italian: the member for McMillan is going to support those people in his electorate. Whether or not you have an English background, I am going to stand by you, especially the new Bosnian people, whom I have terrible difficulty communicating with because of their English skills&mdash;</PARA>

The staff working around me even tonight&mdash;and I wish them all the best stuffing envelopes tonight&mdash;are from an Irish background; one is of direct Italian descent and one is from an Italian&hyphen;English background. They are good people, all of whom you would describe as Australian. But when it comes to the debate that has been raging in this nation, they also feel concerned and just a little bit threatened as to how the broader community treats not only them but their parents and the others around them. It is rather a serious episode; not one for us to enter into tears about but to consider seriously.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8166"> Through the bill we are determined to&mdash;and we will&mdash;achieve the goals that we have set out to achieve. The bill sets out to achieve better management of the migration program. And, as I said before, it is a sovereign right of this nation of Australia to determine its own migration program. The family compo nent has grown disproportionately in recent years&mdash;1995&hyphen;96&mdash;and this stream has grown by 27 per cent, representing nearly 70 per cent of the migration program in 1995&hyphen;96. That is from the minister's second reading speech. Is it not right that we address those issues? Is it not right that we say, `Let us look at this issue and see if we can bring in some changes in the legislation that will effect a better outcome for our community'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the family reunion program, the minister has hitherto only had the power to cap and terminate applications. The amendment that has been missed by most of the speakers on the other side actually allows the minister to cap and queue family migration. The measures are less draconian than the former government had in place, allowing some flexibility. It is the same for children. Where there is criticism where children are affected, it allows the minister to enter in and say, `Here is an issue that is not fitting into the mainstream.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is one of the things that I have argued for in a number of areas of government activity. For a long time we have wanted for those in management positions&mdash;be they ministers, heads of departments or heads of certain areas of government&mdash;to have more flexibility. This bill does exactly that. It gives more flexibility for decisions to be made on behalf of `ordinary'&mdash;I hate the word&mdash;reasonable people who want to come into this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are looking for administrative efficiencies, of course, and the complexity will be removed by merging the visa application fee with the health services charge and the English education charge to form a single visa application charge. The charge will be subject to a maximum specified in the Migration (Visa Application) Charge Bill. Certain applicants will be exempt from the charge: refugees and humanitarian applicants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can you do more than address those in the bottom 20 per cent or 10 per cent? Throughout this bill and all of the government's new legislation, we have addressed ourselves to the social issues of the people who are underprivileged or disadvantaged. There has been no criticism from the other side of this House in regard to that issue.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In de facto relationships where the nature of the relationship forms the basis of an individual's application for citizenship, the veracity of such an arrangement is crucial to the legitimacy of one's citizenship. This bill proposes to allow the government to make regulations under the Migration Act 1958, stipulating that applicants for a permanent visa on the ground of de facto relationship with an Australian citizen or lawful permanent resident satisfies a two&hyphen;year cohabitation requirement as a condition precedent to obtaining a permanent visa. De facto relationships are twice as likely as according to law relationships to fail during the period within which visa applications are assessed. This requirement is consistent with the coalition's election commitments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An exemption will be sought from the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, for otherwise such differential treatment will amount to discrimination on account of marital status, which, of course, is proscribed under the act. There are exceptions to the cohabitation requirement: for instance, where there are children of the relationship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to department advice, Australia has adopted a fair and generous approach to the entry of persons on the grounds of de facto relationships. The US, UK, France and Germany have no provisions allowing permanent entry of a de facto of one of their nationals. New Zealand has a two&hyphen;year waiting period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The integrity of our migration program necessitates decisive action where it is clear that the acquisition of citizenship has been tainted by fraud. The government needs to transmit the right signals about the value of citizenship. The bill proposes to amend the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 and the Migration Act 1958. The changes will add a new ground to the Australian Citizenship Act 1948, empowering the minister to deprive at his or her discretion a person of his or her citizenship where that citizenship is fraudulently procured. Where it can be proved that citizenship has been fraudulently procured, the minister has the right to determine whether a person should stay or go, or whatever else should happen.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8167">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The time limits within which prosecutions needed to be instituted, either pursuant to the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 or the Migration Act 1958, have been removed. The provisions will operate prospectively. Any decision to revoke a person's citizenship on the ground of migration related fraud is subject to full merits review and judicial review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I defend the right of any person to comment on Australia's immigration program or multiculturalism. As a parliamentarian, I am bound by solemn duty to represent all of the people in my electorate. I have many stories to tell about the people in my electorate and I would like to go through a couple very quickly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first is Tony Calabro, whom I met in the music industry. He arrived in Australia from Sicily when he was eight years old. His father had emigrated from Italy a year earlier to find work in Australia. Eventually, Tony Calabro senior landed full&hyphen;time employment at the state electricity commission before starting his own business in the township of Moe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Younger Tony found it difficult as a child contending with racial taunts of `wog' and `dago'. But he became interested in music and formed his own band, after which he began teaching locals how to play guitar. I cannot go into his whole story, because I think he was thrown out of his first band and had to learn a few lessons, as many of us do. But since that start he has taught over 8,500 people in the area and around Australia. He has contributed on a regular basis to local papers on the importance of being positive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As part of a recent LEAP program, which told the story of new immigrants to the La Trobe valley, Tony contributed by telling his story, which has been recorded for posterity. Tony Calabro is a very well&hyphen;known person, as is his brother and the rest of his family, and they have all made a major contribution to their area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of Shameen Rahman, she emigrated from Bangladesh in July 1972 with her husband and son. They settled in the La Trobe Valley in 1975. She says that she felt the racial aspersions cast on members of her family but not on her. Despite the problems <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> her children faced and the family's struggles, she has opened a restaurant in the La Trobe Valley, which has been going now for nearly seven years. Far from being tokenism, this demonstrates the contribution that migrants have made to commerce and culture in the electorate of McMillan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does not matter what name you grab hold of&mdash;it could be the Falcon Soccer Club, which started as a small Italian soccer club and has grown into a national league soccer club&mdash;hopefully, they all play a part, in the minds of many Australians, as our population grows, be it with Indonesians, Filipinos, or whomever. If members care to get hold of them, all these stories are included in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Valley Success Stories: Migrant Voices to be Heard</EMPHASIS>, which was launched at the German Club only a few months ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In finishing my comments on my commitment to multiculturalism and its benefits to Australia, I want to say this: we are most prone to alienating others of dissimilar ethnicity and values when we appropriate fear&mdash;when we appropriate fear in this debate or in any other debate that goes before this House. There has been far too much appropriation of fear and not enough praise of those people who have contributed so greatly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This evening, in the short break we have just had after 6.30, I went down the street in this town and saw the variety of restaurants there. They are not selling just fish and chips and hamburgers; they are selling every nation's food. Every nation's food is appreciated not only here in Canberra but also in Longreach, Tasmania, Morwell, Moe, Traralgon, and all over the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we continue to appropriate fear in this House, we only lead ourselves astray, confuse the issues and set ourselves apart from the community that we serve. From this date, let us move together not to appropriate fear but to appropriate the great pleasures that are before us in this country whilst we have such a great contribution from our multicultural friends. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition campaign of inclusiveness featured no less a figure than the now Prime Minister (Mr Howard), whom members opposite will recall in one television advertisement stopping to allow a friendly Asian Australian to catch up with him and engage in conversation. The message that Liberal Party propagandists, with the Prime Minister's consent, wanted us to believe was that that inclusiveness related especially to migrants. Six months later, the Prime Minister's attempts at inclusion have been shown up. Inclusion has transformed itself into exclusion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition government is less than a year old but already it is demonstrating that disturbing trend of U&hyphen;turn. As Arthur Daly would say, it's got form. This U&hyphen;turn on immigration is par for the course. Already we have had U&hyphen;turns on industry policy, ABC funding, the republic, nursing homes and many other things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will confess to being surprised by the Prime Minister's role in allowing a U-turn on migration policy. It is a political sore which he picked at in 1988 and which festered for several years afterwards. He should know better. He should know that the Australian electorate regards him with caution on immigration and racial matters. He even grudgingly acknowledged some six years later, as he prepared to resume the leadership from the beleaguered member for Mayo (Mr Downer), that his remarks were ill&hyphen;advised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By finally acknowledging that he was wrong to say what he had said back in 1988, the Prime Minister attempted, with some success at the time, to relieve himself of an albatross. But, as these bills demonstrate&mdash;and as his half-hearted responses to the divisive demagoguery of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) have already indicated&mdash;the albatross is back. The Prime Minister wanted migrant <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australians to believe that he could be trusted on migration issues but, unfortunately for him, this bill sends precisely the opposite message to those Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bills being debated this evening involve provisions which will impede the migration process. The bills include measures which are regressive in their impact. In particular, I and other opposition members reject the proposal to increase the English education charge by 250 per cent. We regard the learning of English as important, and I am sorry to hear that members opposite do not regard it as important. Prior to the last election, attitudinal responses of the Australian candidates study of 1996 indicated that more than 97 per cent of Liberal and National Party candidates regarded speaking English as critical to being truly Australian.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In view of that, and in view of the fact that the member for McMillan (Mr Broadbent) referred in his contribution to the difficulty he had communicating with some constituents of his who did not have English language skills, it is absolutely extraordinary that this legislation is in fact increasing the English education charge. It is skyrocketing the English education charge in a way which will discourage migrants from learning English and being able to participate in the Australian community in the way that we would all want them to participate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is ironic that a government promoting the virtues of efficiency and good management has handled its migration reform so poorly and so inefficiently. The sudden mid-year changes to migration regulations by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) have resulted in visa applications being rejected when either immediately before the changes were announced or immediately after the Senate sensibly rejected them those applications would have succeeded. My office has dealt with two such cases in recent weeks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a terrible state of affairs when the department rejects applications without any legal foundation. There is nothing inclusive about these people being told that, because the government messed up the process, they now have to line up again and pay another <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8169"> application fee. There is nothing inclusive about the anger and frustration they feel. The only message prospective Australians have received from this government is that becoming an Australian will be more expensive and more onerous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also wish to comment on what I regard as one of the more objectionable aspects of this legislation&mdash;that is, the power that it will vest in the minister to arbitrarily cap the number of spouse, aged parent and dependent child visas that can be granted in one year. There is nothing honourable or dignified about this proposal. I would say to the House that the government's proposal on capping revives memories of that other infamous conservative numbers game&mdash;that is, the national service lottery. Back then, our defence and foreign policies were reduced to a game of chance. If you happened to be born on a certain day of a certain year, off you went. That was the numbers game that Australians learned to despise because it randomly destroyed Australian lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thought that we had seen the last of Liberal governments replacing proper public policy with numbers games, but I have to stand corrected. In framing this legislation, the government has delved back into its gladstone bag of ministerial tricks and dusted off the national service lottery. There could be few things crueller than telling migrant Australians that, irrespective of their credentials, they have missed out&mdash;the quota has been reached, the gate has been shut, better luck next year. Just like the Vietnam lottery, luck, not compassion or understanding, is the key ingredient.</PARA>

If the real sentiment of migrant communities in this country were to be condensed into any public broadcast, it might well violate existing regulations on language and conduct.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's attitude to migrant Australians deserves condemnation. It betrays the message that the Prime Minister and his propagandists vigorously promoted in the lead-up to the election. Furthermore, it exposes him as someone who, although he might have admitted to earlier folly on migration and racial issues, has failed to learn anything from that experience, if his professed change of heart was in fact sincere in the first place. This is damaging us in a collective sense. This is not without cost, and some of the free speech that the Prime Minister has referred to concerning racial matters and migration matters is not free at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to draw the attention of the House to a recent poll of Asian executives which indicated that over 67 per cent were not satisfied with the Australian government's stance in the race debate. In South Korea, for example, it found that 80 per cent of executives believed that the increase in anti-Asian rhetoric had made Australia less attractive for Asian investment. There are similar figures: Malaysia, 64 per cent plus; Hong Kong, 61 per cent plus; and, Taiwan, 53 per cent plus. The most extreme result was in South Korea where 70 per cent believed Australians were racist while in Indonesia the figure was 59 per cent and in Malaysia it was over 58 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These statistics indicate that this debate and these measures are not without cost in terms of Australia's interests in trade, in business and in becoming closer to the Asian nations and the Asian communities. In addition, this legislation represents both an attack on fundamental family values and a repudiation of the coalition's pre-election commitments. The <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8170"> coalition said prior to the election, `The family unit is the foundation of our society and must be at the core of immigration and settlement policy.'</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last weekend I attended two functions in my electorate which highlighted two important community values that go to the heart of what makes Australia great&mdash;namely, the values of racial tolerance and volunteerism. While the two functions were quite different, they demonstrated in their own way some intrinsic and uplifting features of our Australian way of life that are worth preserving at all costs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On Sunday I attended the opening of the new building of Geelong's Filipino community. I had visited the premises in its early stages of construction when all that existed was a building frame and a couple of walls. The community was seeking funds from individual donors in the form of a buy&hyphen;a&hyphen;brick scheme and also some financial support from the City of Greater Geelong to complete the premises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a pleasure to see the Filipino community gather on Sunday to celebrate the fact that, after much toil and effort largely from community volunteers, the building had been brought to the stage where it could be used for community functions. The fact that the Filipino community is able to enjoy these facilities is due to the extraordinary and dedicated efforts of volunteers who have organised materials and donated their skills and time to construct the building. My congratulations go to the community's committee which has brought this dream to reality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The event on Sunday made a powerful statement about the sort of society Australia is today. Gathered were Australians of caucasian and Asian origin coming together to celebrate their collective achievement. At a time when some in our midst despair at the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> breakdown of family life, I witnessed a community celebration that placed great emphasis on the participation of families and of children. My mind wandered to the current debate on immigration and the sad and negative sentiments that have been unleashed by the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) in her first speech to this parliament&mdash;a regrettable speech because of the sheer inaccuracies that underpinned it and the distorted perceptions that are generated in the wider community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I watched young Australians of Asian origin enjoying the celebration, I thought of how un&hyphen;Australian it would be for any of them to be victimised because of their racial background. Like most of us who are immigrants in this great land, they are entitled to their culture, to their history and to live their lives out as true Australians. More than anything else, they are entitled to an Australian fair go. The racial tolerance we have built into the ethos of the Australian community must be defended from the ill&hyphen;informed, the mercenaries, the bigots and the racists who pine for an Australia that simply does not exist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second event I attended was the 10th anniversary celebrations of the Anakie and District Community Group. Anakie is a small rural town in my electorate. The story of the group's community house is a really interesting one. The first house coordinator, Heather O'Shannessy, started her early days in the job with no carpet or heaters and only a child's chair and a telephone to commence her duties. From these humble beginnings the house has grown to become a meeting place for the residents, holding classes and craft workshops for those seeking to improve their skills and to socialise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The celebrations honoured the contribution to the community of ex&hyphen;Corio Shire Councillor Ray Tucker, who has been the president of the group for the past 10 years. Ray is one of those dedicated volunteers who works tirelessly and unselfishly to build and maintain the bonds of community in his locality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is this sort of commitment by volunteers such as Ray Tucker that has enabled small communities in provincial Australia to develop and retain a sense of local identity amidst <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8171"> the global changes that bear in on even those local communities. I thank both groups for the hospitality that they displayed to me on Sunday. I was made most welcome. More importantly, at both functions there were encouraging signs that a sense of community and local identity are alive and well in provincial Australia.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Forget what the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans) has described as `relevance deprivation syndrome'&mdash;the overwhelming sense of depression experienced by the true believers in South Australia on 11 December 1993, as they were corralled into a wedge between Port Road and Main North Road, makes my federal ALP colleagues look euphoric. It is a measure of how desperate the Labor Party are in South Australia that, three years after their historic election defeat, they are prepared to offer enticements for private and confidential information.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we approach the festive season, it is worth remembering that, in my home state of South Australia, many of the traditions revolve around religious festivals. We have the Oakbank races at Easter, the John Martin's Christmas pageant and the South Australian Brewing Company's Christmas display on the River Torrens. These are all unique and distinctive South Australian traditions. The ALP wants to introduce a new tradition at Christmas&mdash;Christmas hampers for anyone who will give their private details to the ALP database.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Central to my electorate of Boothby is the South Australian state seat of Mitchell. The Labor candidate for the state seat of Mitchell, a Mr Kris Hanna, has circulated a survey pamphlet entitled `Putting South Australia first'. Distributed to the resident with a covering letter, Mr Kris Hanna writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tell us what you think. You could win a Christmas Shopping Spree.</PARA>
<PARA>The covering letter's postscript states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pick up a pen now and let us know what you think. You could win a Myer voucher worth $450!</PARA>

<PARA>What it neglects to say is that anyone who responds to this survey will be receiving direct mail in the future from the ALP as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The matter I would like to draw to the attention of the House would be hilarious if it was not so serious. This prize compromises the electors; this prize compromises democratic process. It is clear that Myer is not impressed. The Electoral Commission has already received several calls questioning the legality of the inducement. The ALP did not need to do this. In my experience, most people actually do like responding to these sorts of surveys.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 1980s, the Labor leader Mike Rann was heralded as the glamour boy of the Bannon government. Forget gender quotas, forget affirmative action and forget factional deals. Under the leadership of Mike Rann, all you have to do is hope that, when Mike puts his hand into the lucky dip, your Christmas bonus will come through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst accepting that the writs have not been issued and the state election cannot, by local statute, be held until next year, the endorsed ALP candidate for the seat of Mitchell, Mr Kris Hanna&mdash;a solicitor and someone who should know better&mdash;in concert with the state Labor leader Mike Rann, has clearly breached the spirit of the state Electoral Act and has clearly breached the spirit of 140 years of solid democratic tradition in South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose I should not be too surprised by the deceit. The ALP have done similar things before. I recall that, during the 1987 federal election, they ran into trouble by having a free barbecue, where sausages were given to anyone who was prepared to support the ALP.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The issue of child labour has been raised in this place, but perhaps not often enough. It is an issue which needs to be raised again and again so that Australians are aware that in some countries children are forced into work in the most appalling conditions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Somewhere between 100 million and 200 million children around the world are forced into labour. Exact statistics are not kept, and one must rely on estimates. Child labour is related to a vast array of problems. It is strongest in areas where there has been no land reform and where there is little opportunity and/or incentive for children to be educated. Any approach to dealing comprehensively with child labour needs to be based on the elimination of all these problems. However, that does not mean that the evil of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> child labour as an issue in its own right should not be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organisation in Singapore this week is a venue where child labour should be raised. In the past, Australian governments of all persuasions have been reluctant to pursue the issues of child labour and human rights through trade agreements. I have long had difficulty with this position, whether it be from this government or from the previous government. If it is legitimate to include economic issues such as subsidy levels in trade agreements, surely it is equally legitimate to include social issues or environmental issues that affect free trade in such agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation is now beginning to develop where Australia is standing alone against the rest of the developed world on the linking of human rights and trade. Given our excellent record of human rights, this is a very disturbing and unfortunate state of affairs. Australia is now at odds with the United States on a role for the World Trade Organisation in promoting human rights. The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) made this quite clear from his remarks on trade and human rights in Singapore yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, the government has refused to sign a trade agreement with the European Union because it contained a now standard clause on human rights that the European Union requires from all its trading partners. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> said in its editorial today that both objections are difficult to understand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bizarre behaviour means that Australia is becoming increasingly isolated from world opinion about the issues of human rights and trade. Most Australians would be disturbed to discover that their government was not prepared to utilise every forum available to it to promote the values that Australians hold dear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If it is appropriate for countries to reduce or even ban some subsidies in the name of global free trade, surely it is just as appropriate for the exploitation of workers and the virtual slavery of children to be considered as barriers as well. Free trade would be of no benefit to those in developing nations if their <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8173"> human rights are violated by them being exploited or forced into child labour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) have said that the issues of labour standards and human rights are issues for Australia to pursue through the International Labour Organisation rather than the World Trade Organisation. This is somewhat ironic, given the significant downgrading of relations between the ILO and Australia that this government has undertaken. Australia has withdrawn from the governing body of the ILO and has closed the permanent representation to the ILO.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the one hand, the government is signalling that it is no longer interested in playing an active role in the International Labor Organisation but, on the other hand, it is saying that it expects it to deal with important human rights issues. The only conclusion that one can draw from this erratic behaviour is that the government is becoming increasingly ambivalent about issues of labour standards in human rights and increasingly out of step with developed world thinking about how best to pursue them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If they are not able to rely on their government to take up these issues, there is still much that Australians as consumers can do to help eradicate child labour. The Rugmark Foundation is an example of such action. In the early 1990s, German and American rug consumers, who account for the purchase of some 80 per cent of the world's rugs, became so concerned about child labour in India's rug production that action was demanded. An Indian export promotion association and anti-child labour groups formed the Rugmark Foundation. Rugmark certifies that a carpet is not made with child labour, and such products carry a label which is identifiable to the consumer. This way the consumer is able to make informed choices about what is purchased.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Trade can never be an issue which is viewed in isolation. Individual consumers and free trading nations should have the right to impose barriers on free trade for countries which do not ensure that trade is free for everyone. </PARA>

I talk, of course, about the people of Port Douglas, one of the jewels of our tropical north, and the place selected by the President and First Lady of the United States to take a well-earned break from their heavy schedule.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The people of Port Douglas pride themselves on their laid-back style, which allows celebrities of every walk of life to come to this beautiful seaside town between rainforest and reef, and to enjoy their time there devoid of the usual trappings of fan madness, celebrity gawkers and autograph hunters that they normally experience wherever they go. It must have been somewhat of a pleasant change for President and Mrs Clinton to dine out at one of the Port's many world-class restaurants&mdash;the Nautilus Restaurant&mdash;amongst other ordinary patrons without any fuss being made of their presence, or for the President to take an early morning jog on Four Mile Beach with nothing more than a good morning nod from other joggers and strollers that he passed. He did this in the luxury of knowing that he was in one of the safest countries in the world. It is so safe that one normally very uptight secret service member said that he considered Australia to be a holiday for him as well as for the President. I am sure that this is what prompted the President to remark on leaving, Macarthur&hyphen;like: `I will return.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The benefit of the President's visit to Port Douglas and to tropical North Queensland has yet to be judged. But the manner in which the Douglas Shire Tourism Association and the local council feted the visiting international media horde seems to be already paying off big&hyphen;time for the area. In one of the best tourism promotional activities I have ever seen, the tourism association and the local council hosted a monster party for the visiting media contingent, serving them up with <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8174"> Australian delicacies and uniquely Australian entertainment in a party that went until dawn.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The result? Holiday inquiries have jumped. Local Internet sites that expound the virtues of Port Douglas to the electronic world are running red hot. This is to be expected when one considers that, for more than two days, Port Douglas was being beamed out to a world of more than 40 million viewers at any one time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> David Zlatarich, President of the Douglas Shire Tourism Association, and his equally hardworking membership, along with Mayor Mike Berwick and his fellow councillors of the Douglas Shire Council, deserve all the credit that can be given to them for seeing the opportunity which presented itself to them, reaching out and grasping it and turning what in itself was an extremely exciting event&mdash;a presidential visit&mdash;into one very successful tourism marketing exercise. I commend them and all of the laid-back residents of Port Douglas who, with that final `I will return' statement by President Bill Clinton, took this beautiful piece of tropical splendour and put it on the world's `must see' list simply by being themselves. But that is our tropical north: absolutely beautiful one day, incredibly fantastic the next.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to raise the issue of superannuation funds and benefits payable to same sex partners. My electorate of Grayndler is a culturally and socially diverse community. In this context, I consider it crucial that a local member represent the diversity of their electorate and continually push for a fair go for all community members. The Gay and Lesbian Rights Lobby, the Australian Council for Lesbian and Gay Rights, trade unions and superannuation industry representatives have recently joined together to push for an overhaul of existing superannuation laws. In short, they certainly need reform.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Thanks to initiatives introduced by the former Labor government, more than 93 per cent of full-time employees, 67 per cent of part-time employees and 59 per cent of casual employees are now covered by superannua tion. Unfortunately, while these reforms saw superannuation money flowing to more workers on the grounds that they were being wrongly excluded, all people are not equal in terms of the benefits they are entitled to when the time comes for superannuation funds to make payment to superannuants' partners, where that partner happens to be gay or lesbian.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Superannuation funds have in the past&mdash;and continue to do so&mdash;relied on the provisions of Australian superannuation legislation to argue that they are prevented from paying benefits to the partners of gay and lesbian contributors. Furthermore, the vast majority of funds have followed the advice issued in a circular by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission which states that `spouse' does not include a partner of the same sex.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The Administrative Appeals Tribunal has considered the meaning of the term `spouse' as defined in the superannuation act. In the matter of Brown v. Commissioner for Superannuation, No. V94/638, Justice Jane Mathews found that the partner of a deceased gay man, a contributor to the Commonwealth superannuation scheme, was ineligible to receive death benefits under the scheme. The trustees of the fund successfully argued that a same sex spouse was not included in the definition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Further discrimination occurs through the taxation system, whereby death benefits paid through a superannuation fund to a dependant are exempted from tax under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. The definition of `dependency' is similar to that in the superannuation legislation, which means that a same sex partner may be in a position of paying tax on any benefits received from the contributor's estate, when an equivalent heterosexual partner would not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The most recent edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Capital Q </EMPHASIS>weekly newspaper highlights the discriminatory impact. I invite members to picture the following scenario. Adam and Sue are co&hyphen;workers. Sue has been living in a de facto relationship with John for the past four years. Adam and Steve have been living together in a mutually supportive relationship for the past <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8175"> 15 years. On their way to a work event, Adam and Sue are killed in a car accident.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Adam and Sue have both been members of their respective funds since 1984 and have both accumulated $100,000. Sue died without leaving a will or completing a nominated beneficiary form. On her death, her super scheme identifies John as her spouse. John receives that $100,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Adam has been more efficient. He has made a will, naming Steve as his sole nominated beneficiary, and has updated his superannuation beneficiary form naming Steve. The trustees of the fund are able to identify Steve as a beneficiary, but there is no legal scope for the trustees to identify Steve as Adam's spouse. As a result, he is considered a non-dependant and is required to pay $15,000 tax on the $100,000 benefit. John, in contrast, has received the whole amount. If Adam had not made a will and updated his beneficiary form, it is likely that the trustees would not have been able to pay some, or even any, of the money to Steve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> It is plainly unfair that all workers and their partners are not able to receive the same benefits from their equal contributions to superannuation schemes. I daresay, Mr Speaker, that this is not an issue which the Howard government is likely to embrace in the near future. It is disturbing&mdash;but probably not surprising&mdash;to see in retrospect that, when John Howard claimed during the election campaign that he stood for all of us, he only meant us as in white, middle-class, Anglo&hyphen;Saxon, employed members of nuclear families like himself&mdash;certainly not gay and lesbian people. The `family values' rhetoric suddenly becomes a bit hollow when we start talking about families headed by gay and lesbian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I was pleased to see that the member for Wentworth (Mr Andrew Thomson) was mentioned in last week's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Star Observer</EMPHASIS> as being a supporter of superannuation reform. I wish the member for Wentworth every success in his endeavours to convince his colleagues from the Lyons Forum and other coalition members of the value of giving all Australian workers a fair go, regardless of their sexuality. I look forward to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> real reform on this issue on the basis of a non&hyphen;discriminatory policy.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<TITLE>Albanians: Electorate of Murray</TITLE>

<ELECTORATE> (Murray)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(10.52 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today, on International Human Rights Day, I want to speak about the contribution that migrants have made to the electorate of Murray and, in particular, to one group, the Albanians. The Albanians came out in the 1920s. In the last century our British and Irish settlers established world&hyphen;best dairy, wheat and sheep production. In this century, the Albanians, the Greeks, the Turks, the Italians and the Dutch came out and established our world&hyphen;best fruit and vegetable production.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 1920s, the Albanians came out literally with nothing more than what they stood in, got to work on the farmland and started to buy and work in orchards. They worked hard, bringing out their families until the 1940s. In 1945, it all stopped. There were no family reunions because of communism back in the home country. The Albanian community in Shepparton continued to thrive, working hard. They built up their mosque. They made sure their children learned both their old and the new ways and they became model Australian citizens. Back home, their homeland, Albania, was mired in economic stagnation. In 1992, communism was replaced by an independent Albania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Albanian&hyphen;Australian community of Shepparton looked back to their homeland. Although many of them were disappointed to find that our Australian family reunion rules meant that it was too late after 50 years or so of separation for them to recontact their parents and grandparents&mdash;that generation had gone&mdash;they decided the one thing they could do as Australian&hyphen;Albanians was to bring out their distant relatives and friends from their home country and have them learn how to become skilled horticultural workers in the Goulburn Valley.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For 12 months we have had some 20 workers come from Albania to the Goulburn Valley, to train at the Goulburn Valley TAFE and on farms around the district. At the end of the two years, they are going to have certificates in occupational rural studies. The <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8176"> Albanian&hyphen;Muslim society fully covers their fee of some $6,000 through their own family sponsorship. They have brought with them their wives and their children. They are absolutely guaranteed to return to their home country, but while they are here they are learning English and becoming skilled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian&hyphen;Albanian community know that this is one way that they can contribute back to their home country and build ties between these countries. They have the country they have now adopted and call home, where they have made such a major contribution as strong, hardworking, honest Australians. At the same time, they recognise that the country of their birth, of their parents and grandparents, needs the skills that only Australia can teach at this time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that is a fantastic example of what multiculturalism is all about in Australia. It is all about our country accepting difference in religion. The Albanian community have their Muslim mosque and we appreciate that mosque in the Shepparton community. We admire their religious convictions and the strength of their teachings as their children from one generation to the next become strong Muslims. We admire their hard work; we admire their contribution to every aspect of Australian society. We also admire their continued association with their home country and the fact that today they are helping to make the new Albania economically independent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am proud to speak about the Albanian Goulburn Valley community tonight. I hope these first occupational trainees will go back with a lifelong sense of the friendship that Australia extends. I hope that other ethnic and international groups will come out and also try to learn like these Albanian people have by taking a similar course. Certainly, the Goulburn Valley TAFE will welcome all those oncoming sets of new trainees.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

I have just re <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> ceived a pamphlet, which is to be put out by council, entitled `Message from the Mayor'. This pamphlet attacks the Liberal candidate David Doust. It is authorised by the Labor mayor who, incidentally, has authorised the pamphlets put out by at least two other candidates who are self&hyphen;confessed Labor stalwarts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This pamphlet I refer to has used ratepayers' moneys to attack a candidate politically opposed to the ruling faction on the council and, in my opinion, has done so quite illegally. In this by&hyphen;election, David Doust has made justifiable comments on the performance of council. As the ruling faction on the council do not like what David Doust is saying, they have decided to use community moneys in an attempt to stop him getting elected.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my opinion, what Burwood Council has done tonight, under the heading `Message from the Mayor', is illegal. I therefore have no option but to advise my community that I will be recommending to the Minister for Local Government that the council be sacked.

In the past, parliamentary secretaries on their own volition have become involved in the adjournment debate. But to attempt to extend the adjournment debate&mdash;which has always been the device that the executive government has used to quite properly respond to matters raised by ordinary members&mdash;to deal with a matter which is of pertinence only to the parliamentary secretary is, I would think, most out of order. If, as the parliamentary secretary says, he has been threatened, he should not use this device to deal with that. That is a significantly important issue in itself. The parliamentary secretary should raise that as a matter of privilege, if it dealt with the way he does his job, or in some other way, because that is very important. To use the adjournment debate in this way is a bit of an abuse of the power that the minister or the parliamentary secretary at the table has, as opposed to what other members have and I do not think this helps the process.

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0J4">Mr Ruddock</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The Government does not consider it necessary or appropriate at this time to alter the definition of `family unit' in the Migration Regulations, which is applicable to all visa classes including business and independent, to include a person in a same&hyphen;sex relationship with an applicant for migration. The Migration Regulations define `member of the family unit' as a spouse, dependent child, parent, brother, sister, grandparent, grandchild, aunt, uncle, niece or nephew (and their step-equivalents).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The same-sex partner of an applicant for migration must apply for a visa in their own right if they wish to join their partner in Australia. A person in a same-sex relationship with an Australian citizen, permanent resident or eligible New</PARA>
<PARA><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8181"></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Zealand citizen is able to apply for an Interdependency visa for migration to Australia, sponsored by the Australian partner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Following the disallowance by the Senate of certain parts of Migration Regulations (Amendment) Statutory Rules 1996, No 211, the provisions of Regulation 1.20J apply to prospective spouses and onshore spouse and interdependency applicants, but not to offshore spouse and interdependency applicants where disallowance revoked the new temporary subclasses 309 and 310. Following discussions with the Opposition, the Government intends, subject to agreement by the Senate, to reintroduce this provision for offshore spouses and interdependency applicants at an early stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sponsorship limitations specified in Regulation 1.20J are to restrict the number of sponsorships or nominations a person can lodge for a partner (spouse, fiance or interdependency applicant) to a maximum of two in their life time, at least five years apart. Additionally, a person who was themselves granted a permanent visa as a spouse or fiance, or on interdependency grounds, is restricted from sponsoring another partner for at least five years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">These limitations can be waived where the Minister is satisfied that there are compelling circumstances affecting the sponsor or nominator. Compelling circumstances, for the purposes of Regulation 1.20J of the Migration Regulations, are not prescribed in legislation. Each case will be considered on its merits. Policy guidance to assist decision makers is that compelling circumstances could include, but are not limited to, situations where there are children of the new relationship, the new relationship is long-standing, or a previous spouse has died.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Following the disallowance by the Senate of certain parts of Migration Regulations (Amendment) Statutory Rules 199, No 211, the new visa subclasses 309 and 310 have been revoked.</PARA></ANSWER></ANSWER.TO.QON></ANSWERS.TO.QUESTIONS></HANSARD>
