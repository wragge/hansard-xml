<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill is the first of three in the legislation package for the implementation of a cost recovery regime for import related services delivered by the Australian Customs Service, which was announced by the government in the 1996&hyphen;97 budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The three bills in this legislation package provide the legislative authority for the imposition and collection of 13 charges and fees for import related services delivered by the Australian Customs Service. The 13 imposts are located in two new charges bills and this Customs Amendment Bill, and will apply full cost recovery for commercial customs activities directly and indirectly required to process imports. This measure is consistent with the general thrust of government policy which increasingly sees the closer alignment of service delivery costs with sectors of the community which generate the workload.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For instance, the user&hyphen;pays system is already used in relation to the recovery of costs of processing passengers at international airports through the passenger movement charge. Similarly, the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service introduced cost recovery in the early 1990s for its work associated with the movement of international cargo. The services to be covered by the new charges in this legislative package are:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the processing of cargo reports (both sea and air),</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> import entry processing (sea, air and post), and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> licensing of approved places for the examination of  goods</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To coincide with this measure, Customs has taken the opportunity to streamline elements of two existing fees. The first relates to refund of customs duty application fees and the second relates to administrative arrangements for the determination of costs associated with out of hours work by Customs officers or for work by Customs officers at locations where customs work is not usually performed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation package sees an extension of the current cost recovery regime for import related services. Customs currently recovers part of the cost of its electronic systems&mdash;amounting to approximately $18.5 million in 1995&hyphen;96&mdash;through charges levied on importers for import entries. The extension of the charging arrangements, however, relates only to commercial import processing. It does not cover activity associated with Customs' community protection function relating to the detection and interception of prohibited imports and drugs. The government recognises Customs' important role in this area and has, in the budget, provided funds to Customs to significantly increase the use of sophisticated technology to maintain and enhance its community protection capability. Nor will charges apply to the processing of export transactions. The exemption of exports from the new user&hyphen;pays system is a recognition of the key role export industries will play in improving Australia's trade balance, creating more jobs and reducing the federal deficit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Customs has undertaken detailed activity based costing of its services to ensure that the costs recovered do not exceed the costs calculated to process import transactions. The cost model used in calculating the charges has been reviewed by two firms of external auditors. The charges are limited to the calculated costs of delivering the functions, and will be reviewed annually to ensure that they only reflect the actual costs of service delivery. Any efficiencies identified in service <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> delivery will be passed on through lower charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One hundred and three thousand importers generated around 2.2 million customs import entries in 1995 containing 7.2 million entry lines. Ninety&hyphen;eight per cent of these entries were lodged electronically with Customs. Based on the 1995 data, 95 per cent of entries have 10 lines or less and will incur the minimum charge. The new charges, for the majority of entries, will see the current electronic entry cost rise from $8.75 to $29.65 (sea) or $22.80 (air and post). The present charge of $8.75 only picks up some of the computer costs for entry processing and does not represent full cost recovery. Although the increase in entry costs is significant, in absolute terms the additional costs will be small for the majority of importers. For example, 65 per cent of importers make four or less entries per year and would incur a total cost increase of less than $85 per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After the budget announcement, members of the Customs National Consultative Committee were briefed at a special meeting about the nature of the proposed charges. This committee comprises representatives from the Australian Air Transport Association, the Australian Chamber of Shipping, the Australian Federation of International Forwarders, the Customs Brokers Council of Australia, the International Air Couriers Association, the Australian Chamber of Commerce, the Law Council of Australia and the Institute of Chartered Accountants. Their feedback resulted in some changes being made to the charges for entry processing and the methods of collection. This committee met again in September where the charges were once more the subject of discussion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Informal meetings have been held with various sectors of the importing community, such as the air express couriers, the cargo terminal operators and the Australian International Movers Association, in regard to establishing the most efficient collection methods for the charges. In meeting with a variety of industry sectors, Customs was made aware of some difficulties the collection of cargo reporting fees and screening fees would impose on cargo terminal operators and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6770"> shipping companies for manual reporting charges and on air express couriers for screening charges. As a result, the legislation now provides that special arrangements may be entered into for the collection of these charges, including periodic settlement arrangements to coincide with the operating environment and billing cycles experienced by many of the firms in the importing community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to meetings called at the behest of industry, Customs has conducted a series of industry briefing sessions in all state and territory capital cities and in several regional centres. These sessions have provided an opportunity for Customs to explain details about the charges and how they will be collected. At the same time, the sessions have provided a valuable forum for feedback from all sectors of the importing community, much of which has influenced implementation decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The three bills which comprise this legislation package will provide the legislative authority for the imposition and collection of the 13 charges and fees for the import related services delivered by Customs to which I have referred. In particular, this bill contains:</PARA>
<PARA>1. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the fees relating to the processing of those entries which are required to move imported goods out of a warehouse and into home consumption;</PARA>
<PARA>2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the replacement fees currently contained in the Customs Act for the processing of applications for refund of customs duty and for the provision of officers' services either out of hours or at locations where such services are not usually provided;</PARA>
<PARA>3.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the administration provisions for the charges contained in the Import Processing Charges Bill; and</PARA>
<PARA>4.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the requirements of the new Customs depot licensing regime, whose related charges are contained in the Customs Depot Licensing Charges Bill.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6771"> This bill contains charges associated with the new depot licensing regime for Customs depots which are appointed for the examin ation of goods subject to Customs control, or for the consolidation of goods for export, or for the deconsolidation of goods after importation.

<TIME.STAMP>(9.45 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition finds this measure a highly obnoxious one and we will be opposing the Student and Youth Assistance Amendment (Waiting Period) Bill. Basically, it is one of a number of what you might term little nasties in this year's budget and a number of these pertain to the area of student assistance. I say that it is one of a number. I would also instance things such as the abolition of the incidentals allowance for homeless secondary school students. This is the funding that enables disadvantaged students to access things such as textbooks and other requisites for them to participate in education. That is one of the other little nasties. Another one is the abolition of case management of homeless <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> secondary students. Again, you could hardly imagine a more heartless decision than to deprive particularly disadvantaged secondary school students&mdash;that is, those who are homeless&mdash;of access to comprehensive holistic case management assistance to help them overcome their very many problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are other decisions such as the decision to increase the age at which students are deemed independent of their parents from 22 to 25. That measure reverses an important reform introduced by the former government to reduce that age of independence from 25 to 22. When you put all the different measures that the government is instituting in the student assistance area together, you are looking at creating something of the order of 125,000 losers&mdash;I think that is the figure from memory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of things being done in this area which are bad. We do not say that everything that is being done is bad. There are a number of the measures that we have said that we will support, but there are a number that we take strong exception to. This one that we are debating today that imposes a two&hyphen;year waiting period on migrants before they can access Austudy, we think, is a very bad step.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is, of course, part of an overall package of changes in this area, most of which apply to Social Security payments. The coalition did say before the election that they would introduce a two&hyphen;year waiting period for certain payments but they also specifically precluded certain areas of payment from the ambit of this measure and these included Austudy. This is a clear instance of the coalition breaking their promise, one of the very many. We do not intend to stop reminding this government of instances where it has broken clear election promises and this is another case in point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The thing about the whole structure of income support in this country is that it is important to bear in mind that, in government, we aimed to create a comprehensive income security safety net and that included the many payments made through Social Security and also payments made through the Department of Employment, Education and Training and Youth Affairs, payments such as Austudy, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6772"> Abstudy, assistance for isolated children and so forth. There is a whole structure there and a key objective that we had in creating that structure was to minimise the likelihood of the creation in this country of an underclass of absolutely destitute people cut off from what we would regard as the normal and appropriate opportunities in life, and that includes access to education and access to assistance for education purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yes, we did introduce a six&hyphen;month waiting period for certain payments, but we thought very carefully about that and were particularly concerned to at least strike some reasonable balance between creating a deterrent to people seeking to migrate inappropriately on the one hand but avoiding a situation where people were deprived of any source of support for protracted periods of time on the other. It is a very difficult balance and we think extending that period from six months to two years is frankly unconscionable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is important to think about how all these different decisions are going to come together. Of course, there is provision under the government's proposals that people may be able to access special benefit within that two&hyphen;year period if they can demonstrate some unforeseen and unforeseeable change of circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a very tough test, but I think the important point to make about this, particularly when we are talking about Austudy, is that the people that are being penalised are not just people who might have come here carelessly without thinking through how they were going to support themselves once they got to this country. We are talking here about their dependent children. Even those who are able to satisfy this pretty steep hurdle and qualify for special benefit as a result of unforeseeable circumstances will only be able to get the basic rate of special benefit, equivalent to single person unemployment payment as a maximum, plus the very low rate of basic family payment over and above that, but not the additional level of family payment which is available for people on low incomes and which is highly targeted. That very much more substantial sum which is available normally to citizens of this country if they are <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> on a low income will be denied to migrants in this circumstance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They will also, of course, be denied, as a result of this bill, access to Austudy. So you might have a secondary school kid from a background which is not particularly advantaged, having to overcome the problems of English not being their native language in the first instance, and being deprived of access to additional family payment and also access to Austudy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What will that do to the total income support available to an extended family that might have a number of children? They will get, if they are lucky, the basic rate of special benefit set at the single rate of unemployment payment. To suggest that that is an adequate income support package for a family containing a number of dependent children is just patently ludicrous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will penalise not only the people who, the government might argue, did not think carefully enough about how they were going to support themselves before they came to this country but also their dependent children and it will reduce them to poverty and penury. There is no provision, as I said, other than this access to the very basic rate of special benefit, if they are lucky&mdash;if they can show their change in circumstances was unforeseen&mdash;to gain any decent level of income support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This completely undermines what we sought to do in government&mdash;that is, to create a comprehensive safety net. Do we really want to finish up with a society which has a class of people who are reduced to doing nothing but begging, prostituting themselves or scrounging in order to survive? As I said, this will affect not just the parents who, the government might argue, came here carelessly without thinking through the implications of migration&mdash;the government might say there is some element of fault in the way they acted&mdash;but also their children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was recently in the United States. The striking thing as you walk around the streets of the cities of that country is the large number of people you see begging who have no source of support. The United States, unlike us, has not built up a comprehensive <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6773"> safety net. You do get chucked off the unemployment payment after a limited period of time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even under the Democratic administration over there, albeit with a Republican&hyphen;controlled Congress, you are now seeing what they term `welfare reform' resulting in the prospect of large numbers of sole parents also being chucked off any form of income support after a finite period. Do we really want to go down that route of creating a class of people like that? This sort of measure does start to produce exactly that effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is singularly ironic that the government is doing things like this measure, getting rid of the incidentals allowance and getting rid of the case management of homeless secondary students at a time when it is also prating about the importance of addressing problems of literacy in our young people. Addressing literacy is a key objective and it is something we attached a very considerable priority to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly literacy is a particular problem for people who do not come from an English speaking background. What on earth is the rationale for denying or reducing the access to educational opportunities of young people who are going to be affected by this measure and who are going to have to overcome that lead in the saddlebag of not having English as their native language in the first place?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The educational disadvantage suffered by people from non-English speaking backgrounds is something we gave a great deal of attention to when we were in government. In all parts of the education and training system we introduced special programs to address this particular problem. A great deal was done in the schools area. For example, we had specially targeted programs through the schools program and in the higher education area we had the higher education equity program, which had a particular focus on a number of disadvantaged groups, including people from non-English speaking backgrounds. As a result of what was done through those programs some significant things were achieved. We did achieve demonstrable improvements in educational participation rates by people from non-English speaking backgrounds.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a particular problem with literacy. We acknowledged that that was something that needed to be addressed. But what on earth is the rationale for implementing a measure like this which denies educational income support to some of the most potentially educationally disadvantaged people by virtue of their lack of English as a first language? What possible rationale can there be for this measure? How can the government justify it in terms of all the other rhetoric it engages in on these matters?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a longer term agenda of the government in the whole area of student income support spelled out in this year's budget. The government announced that it was going to explore the option of consolidating all youth income support payments under a single so-called youth allowance. The government clearly has in mind there looking at the different kinds of payments that are made to young people&mdash;Austudy, unemployment payments, et cetera&mdash;identifying the least attractive features of each and producing a new payment which is a kind of a levelling down of the provisions of the various existing payments. If you read the discussion paper on the youth allowance that was released, it is very clear that this is its intention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So as well as doing a number of what you might call little nasties in the area of student income support, like the sort of measure we have been talking about this morning which is embodied in this bill, I believe the government has a longer term agenda to perpetrate some very big nasties. There is a great deal of scope to do that if you go for that levelling down approach. Having been on the ERC for a number of years, I know the sorts of options that the Department of Finance can cook up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can identify the most generous aspects of each payment, whether it be Austudy or unemployment payments. For example, Austudy has a rather more generous personal income test than unemployment payments and it also has a personal income test that operates on an annualised basis rather than on a fortnightly basis. One of the options which was canvassed in this discussion paper was: why don't we move to this fortnightly basis and align the arrangements for students and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6774"> for the unemployed on the basis of the less attractive income testing structure?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the other hand, the criteria for independence from parents are also different. In this respect, the unemployment payments are more generous. You are deemed independent of your parents over the age of 18; whereas if you are a student the age is 22&mdash;and the government is proposing to put that up again to 25. Maybe the government would consider levelling down the accessibility of these payments by choosing the least generous of the provisions in regard to deemed independence from parents. When you read the discussion paper on youth allowance that the government issued in the context of the budget, which canvasses the various options, it is very clear that this is precisely the sort of proposition that they have in mind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> We are already seeing substantial changes to Austudy&mdash;a number of which are highly objectionable and which vary in their budgetary significance. This one is, I suppose, a middle ranking one. The savings it produces are not trivial but they are not that great when compared with the totality of funding going through this program. There are a number of other measures which produce much larger savings that we find objectionable, such as the proposal to increase the age of independence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a whole range of things here which will disadvantage a large number of people. It is singularly objectionable that the government would be doing things that would have the consequence of reducing the children to absolute penury, potentially. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Mr Abbott) in responding might like to describe what measures the government will put in place to pick up the needs of these kids that will be reduced to poverty by this sort of measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also ask him to say whether the children of migrants who come here and are unable to support themselves ought to be penalised for the lack of judgment, you might say, of their parents. Is the government suggesting that? If so, the government might like to provide something in the nature of a moral justification for the stance which is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> being taken in that regard. I do not believe for a minute that there is any moral justification.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This, as I said, opens up the prospect of something which in our society we have tried over the years to avoid, and that is the real prospect of a group of people potentially having to go out on the streets and beg, resort to crime or whatever in order to get some kind of capacity to survive. That I think is fundamentally objectionable. We will be voting against this bill both here and in the Senate. Our objections to this legislation are very serious and very profound.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity today to comment on the Student and Youth Assistance Amendment (Waiting Period) Bill, which has been introduced by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Mr Abbott) in recent sitting weeks. Before I get to my speech, I should respond to the remarks of the previous speaker, the member for Sydney (Mr Peter Baldwin), who as minister did his level best to achieve his ideological aims in supporting and creating a social security safety net but, unfortunately, was dwarfed by the indifference of the Labor Party to their core supporters over the last 100 years. Sadly, the 13 years of Labor government managed to achieve a significant and growing gap between the rich and the poor.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So when the member for Sydney says that the Liberal Party and the National Party want to reduce people to penury&mdash;nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, it is the Liberal Party and the National Party that want to build up, support and create the opportunities for people who are currently living in penury after 13 years of Labor government, so that those people can once again hold their heads high and be full contributors to Australian society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Most of the bills that we have debated in this House since returning here after the March election have been about making good on our campaign commitments to the people of Australia. During that campaign, we signalled our intent to introduce a two-year waiting period on social security benefits for newly arrived immigrants. Legislation to make that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6775"> happen is currently being considered by the parliament, and this bill could be considered its adjunct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By Donald Horne's definition or anybody else's, Australia is a lucky country but, as any gambler knows, streaks come to a close and fortune can flee as quickly as it arrived&mdash;as probably most of us discovered on Tuesday in the Melbourne Cup. It is a measure of our resilience and depth of resources that lady luck stayed with us long enough to survive 13 years of Labor's gambling with our money and our future, and long enough to give Australians the opportunity to throw that government out of office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australians went to the polls, not dazed by the coalition's promises of an easy jackpot but with the realisation that it was time to stop rolling the dice. In the early morning of 3 March, Labor landed heavily on its head on the footpath outside the casino.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government was elected with a clear mandate for fiscal responsibility. This government will do better because we realise it is not our money we are playing with&mdash;it is more than the future of just the government that is at stake. Thus, we on our side of the House, unlike the member for Banks (Mr Melham), have learned when to say no.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has long been a country of which others are envious. Our population has grown rapidly since Federation as immigrants have come to our shores. We have welcomed people from all parts of the globe, and it is only right that we have done so. I believe that today Australia is the world's most successful immigrant nation, much more successful than the United States or any other immigrant nation. Rather than the melting pot that the United States claims to be or likes to call itself, I prefer to think of our nation more as a wok, with the human ingredients that make up our society contributing but retaining their individual flavours and distinct cultures, while at the same time combining to produce a very harmonious whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Immigration has proven to be a very rich and mutually beneficial experience for this country. Traditions, customs and cultures have been transported across time and oceans, and have become part of a colourful, but seamless, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australian way of life. Our climate, our landscape and our lifestyles have become magnets for those seeking a new life down&hyphen;under and provided a new backdrop for old ways. This year 74,000 people will make Australia their new home and, given time, will no doubt make their mark on this country as this country will also mark its mark on them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is very supportive of and, indeed, entirely committed to the immigration program. As this government is tightening the belt in nearly every area of administration, it is only fitting that entitlements for our immigrants also come under review. Thus, from 1 January next year, new immigrants wishing to study will be subject to a 104-week waiting period before receiving Austudy benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Immigration is unlike tourism. Those attempting to entice a tourist to buy a ticket to take the long flight to Australia often dangle a free rental car or a week's accommodation or, in slower periods, even more lucrative bonuses as a carrot to get tourists to Australia. The immigration department, as all members of parliament would know, does not have to go to any lengths to attract customers; the immigration department is always busy. While immigration numbers rise and fall with ever changing conditions around the world, there are always many more people who wish to settle in this country than there are places available to take them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People come to Australia for many reasons. Some are forced by misery, war or oppression in their native lands to look to our shores for dignity and freedom from tyranny which we offer them. But many others come here on a more voluntary basis because they see Australia as a kind of new frontier where they can make a fresh start&mdash;and I like to believe that is what our country still is. Others in increasing numbers come to Australia in order to reunite with family members who are already settled here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are a very generous nation, but we have never offered carte blanche rights to immigration. Our policy was, for many years, very restrictive, dangerously so. But over the past quarter of a century that policy has, quite rightly, become blind to colour and creed. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6776"> Our approach has become non-discriminatory and bipartisan. We have, for a long time, attempted to balance the wishes and aspirations of those looking toward Australia with the needs and desires of those already living here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill requires that new arrivals in Australia provide for their own education in the first two years. Our schools and institutions of learning will still be available. But it will be incumbent on families, friends and communities to provide funding for education in those first two years. I believe that this is a very fair initiative, though some might have trouble calling belt tightening an initiative or, for that matter, believing that belt tightening is necessarily fair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Surprisingly, there are people left in Australia who still believe that we have infinite financial resources&mdash;and I am sure that the member for Chifley (Mr Price) and the member for Banks will prove that in the debate later; certainly, the member for Sydney has already done so. Unhappily, most of them sit in this parliament but, fortunately, most of them sit on the opposition benches&mdash;and there are not too many of them left at this time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe that this measure will prevent anybody who is genuine about wanting to settle in Australia from applying to come here. There are plenty of clubs and associations that impose a waiting time on those seeking to join. Certainly, full membership in the Australia society is something to be sought after and is well worth the wait. I do not believe that this measure will prevent anyone who is serious about getting an education from doing just that. A glance at any list of high achievers in education will reveal not just Anglo-Celtic names but those of many derivations. Education is prized in most societies&mdash;in some perhaps even more so than it is here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Though this measure will save $6 million this year and double that figure in 1997-98, the primary motivation behind this bill is fairness. With the new rules will also come the exceptions, based once again on fairness. When the member for Sydney asked that associated question, he failed to make any <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reference to the exceptions that are contained in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Refugees and humanitarian immigrants and their immediate family members will not be subject to the two-year waiting period; therefore, those most needing assistance with new settlement will remain eligible to receive it. Immigrant spouses and fiancees of Australian citizens who have been living in Australia awaiting permanent residency will also be exempt from these new provisions. Those over the age of 18 who unwittingly became unlawful while still children also will not be subject to this legislation; nor will those aged under 21 who lose access to a parental home and financial support after their arrival in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">New Zealanders currently are subject to a six-month waiting period for Austudy. Those who settle in Australia after 1 January next year will also be subject to the same two-year waiting period, dated from the day of permanent settlement and not including absences from Australia. This will place them on an equal footing, quite rightly, with immigrants from other nations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be widespread support for this measure in the community. Government certainly has a responsibility to ensure that new arrivals to our nation are treated with dignity and respect, and are assisted along the way so that they can take in and eventually contribute to the richness of Australian life. But families and community are even more important than government in this process. This is hardly news to many immigrant groups. I am sure that it is not news to the member for Banks, who I suspect realises this better than most&mdash;certainly better than the Labor Party did during its term in office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While disposing of much of their long&hyphen;held and much discredited dogma, Labor pushed the pork barrel to new limits, believing that government help was more productive than self&hyphen;help. It believed that, if there were a vote in it, it could find a way to buy it. That attitude was paternalistic and naive in the extreme. People who can would rather help themselves. I do not think the Labor Party understands this any more. March 2 proved that Labor had lost touch with the electorate; <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6777"> that, despite the claims that it knew all the answers, it was just too smart by half. Leadership is an essential quality, and there are times when government should lead and help shape public opinion. But as Labor discovered, listening is just as important as preaching, and immigration is one of those areas where government should always be attuned to the views of the people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By every reliable measure, it seems that the Australian people&mdash;and I am grateful that they are&mdash;are happy with the general thrust of immigration policy as it has been implemented by successive governments in the last 25 years, both Labor and Liberal. But in recent years, as the framework has been twisted and the numbers coming to Australia skewed in favour of family reunion and away from skilled categories, unfortunately there have been pockets of uneasiness in the community caused by hard economic circumstances, certain misunderstandings of the aims and value of our immigration program and the 20 years of major economic reform that has occurred in this country&mdash;reform which some would say has been great for the country. But the people themselves feel a much greater sense of insecurity, and perhaps governments have failed in the last 20 years to bring the people along with them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some, unfortunately, have sought to exploit this. But, as the continued poor showing at the polls by single issue groups and fringe groups indicates, even in the Lindsay by-election, those attempts have been transparent and have found little favour with the average Australian voter and have found favour with only the particularly ignorant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While this government is committed to all areas of immigration policy, including family reunion, we are seeking to restore balance to overall numbers. Australia benefits most, and certainly more quickly, when our intake contains higher levels of skilled migrants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By restoring some balance to this program, there will be less call for government assistance in terms of financial support to guide new arrivals through the initial years of settlement. Thus, as is our position with other income support, this government believes Austudy should be delayed for the first two <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> years of legal residence, except under the circumstances that demand special consideration that I outlined earlier in my contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The vast majority of people who come to live in Australia view this nation as an increased opportunity to prosper. They expect to support themselves and to be helped by family and friends already resident here. There is no good reason to lower those expectations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is fair to the people of Australia, to the millions of taxpayers whose contributions make possible a generous immigration program. It is fair to all those who will come to live in Australia after 1 January next year whose minor sacrifice will barely be noticed as they embark on their exciting life in a new land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We who have lived in this country all our lives perhaps do not understand how truly blessed we are. We take for granted things only dreamed of in some other places. For many new immigrants to Australia, some of whom have had the experience of even their most basic freedoms being suppressed by government, it is enough to live free of a totalitarian regime. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to oppose the Student and Youth Assistance Amendment (Waiting Period) Bill. I welcome opportunities to discuss the level of migration to Australia and any other issue associated with migration. It is becoming very fashionable in Australia to start belting migrants.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I found it very interesting listening to the contribution of the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Pyne). He does not say, `The coalition government has increased the numbers ever so slightly over and above the figures of the last government.' We hear words that suggest that migrants have made a great contribution to Australia, and I think they have, but that they need to suffer belt tightening, that they should have more self-help, that Australia is a wok and that getting Austudy is like joining a club. I find all these comments very interesting.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6778">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lest anyone be in any doubt, I rise in this debate to give my clear support for migration. As a result of the last election and as a result of some of the government's measures, there is great concern in the community about migration and what migrants are entitled to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When migrants come to Australia in a Qantas aeroplane they are not met by a department of housing official and given keys to new public housing. They are not met by a representative of the Holden or Ford motor companies and given keys to a brand new car. Nor are they met by an officer of the CES and told to report to work at a particular location. Yet many people in the community believe that all this happens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the first thing I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Mr Abbott), who is at the table, is: what is the justification for this? I believe that the report into student financial assistance in 1991 is still the most current parliamentary committee report that reviews Austudy, and here it is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is not one submission in this to suggest that the children of migrants&mdash;and this is what we are talking about&mdash;are somehow receiving excessive special treatment over and above other Australians. There is not one submission in this report that suggests this. There is not one conclusion that says that we need to ensure that migrant families and children of migrants go through a special belt tightening exercise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Will the honourable parliamentary secretary tell the House where the motivation comes from for this? I think the club analogy may or may not be a good analogy, because many more migrants seek to come than we ever permit. If being able to migrate to this country is a club, it is a very exclusive club. I do not attack that. But I think it is ridiculous to suggest it is almost pro forma&mdash;those who want to come can gain entry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When they do gain entry there is a whole raft of fees they have to pay&mdash;for example, dislocation costs. In many instances, they have to settle into a country foreign to them, learn a language foreign to them and make sure their families are not unsettled by the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> whole process of this huge move. I consider the fact that people want to choose to come to Australia and make this country their own a great honour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are saying in this bill is that, whatever we do to the adults in that family, we have to specially target the children. If they are eligible for Austudy&mdash;that is, if they are in year 11 and 12&mdash;and they financially qualify for Austudy, they should not get it for two years. If they finish high school in another country and come here and want to do a TAFE course or a university course and they would otherwise be eligible for Austudy, we are saying, `No, you don't get it.' Frankly, I do not understand why.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the parliamentary secretary were coming here and saying, `Look, I have cases of great rorting, great abuse of the system, and we have to close a loophole,' then I would say, `Yes, I am willing to listen to your argument and to consider your move.' If he is saying, `I have some great principle of fairness and equity involved here that singles out migrant children and they will be especially benefited by the implementation of this principle,' then again I would say, `I am prepared to consider it and form an opinion about it.' But no. It is really pandering, I think, to a populist view that migrants get it too easy and, therefore, we will not only introduce measures that punish migrant parents but we will target their children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is very trite when members of the government get up and say, `We are really in favour of migration. We think migrants are wonderful people. They have made a great contribution to Australia, but we are happy to introduce legislation which targets and singles out migrant children.' I think that is a degree of hypocrisy. I think there ought to be some internal consistency in the argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know it is only a petty point, but the member for  Sturt said that this measure will save $6 million next year and it will double to $12 million the year after, as though there is some huge cumulative effect in these measures. Of course, there is not. The first year is a part year&mdash;that is what $6 million represents&mdash;and $12 million is a full year <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6779"> recovery. The increased savings in future years are rather marginal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Will someone from the government rise in this place and say why it is important that the children of migrants who come here to Australia need to be singled out, when every other citizen and person in this country in a similar financial circumstance would receive assistance to ensure that their children stay on to year 11 and 12 or to allow them to go on to further tertiary study? We do not usually argue about it&mdash;you are hacking and slashing at Austudy too&mdash;for everyone else, but we do about these children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is it resented on the government side that often people who come to Australia have a passion about education and that they very much instil this into their children? Is this an attribute of migration that is resented on the government side? Are you trying to use some of the gambling analogies of the member for Sturt, trying to put some lead in the educational saddlebags of these children? I am really interested to hear what the parliamentary secretary will say to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as I am concerned, I see the future of Australia as being one nation. I see it as one nation with many cultures. I believe that we have benefited from successive waves of migration. Currently, migration numbers are quite low. If there were one thing we could do for all Australians it would be to create more jobs, not reduce the number of jobs being created, as this government is doing. But, if we want to secure our future, we cannot isolate young people in the community and say, `We will have a suboptimal development of your educational potential,' and then consider that we will be the lucky country and be able to then carry that into the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The future of Australia really rests on the way we develop opportunities and the way we develop the talents of our young people and ensure that they have got a good start in the world of work and that they will go through periods of further education and re&hyphen;education. We should not, at such an early point of their introduction to Australia, start raising the barriers, increasing the difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing I should point out&mdash;perhaps I have not made this clear&mdash;is that not every <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> family that comes to Australia as migrants with children of an age perhaps eligible to receive Austudy would receive Austudy or would seek to receive Austudy. Why are we saying that in Australia we can only take people who are effectively, I suppose, fairly wealthy and not give them the start to life in Australia that they might otherwise secure? I will not speak any longer, but I just want to go over the points&mdash;</PARA>

The Deputy Leader of the National Party, the member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), was on the committee, as were the member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott). This was a total review of Austudy which did not get a favourable response when the report was tabled. Most of its recommendations were subsequently implemented. There was not one submission about the need to target migrant children and deny them Austudy benefits&mdash;not one submission. It is not mentioned in the report and it was not drawn to the committee's attention.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know the financial impact, and you are required to put that down with the bill. But what will be the social impact? Will it make no difference?

How will electorates like mine, with about 26 per cent of people having a migrant background, benefit from this measure? Can you tell us a direct social benefit?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Alternatively, isn't it a fact, as the shadow minister suggested, that this can have adverse social consequences&mdash;that, rather than going to school, some may be precluded from going to school and that we will see a greater incidence of gangs?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This education bill raises an important question. It raises an important principle: what should be the role of Austudy? For me, surely the role of Austudy is to improve access to education in an equitable fashion. It is interesting to note that during Labor's 13 years there was little advance in the share of students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds entering higher education.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that Austudy should be targeted to those from less affluent backgrounds who cannot rely on family support or supplementary incomes if that government support is withdrawn. But, without better targeting, we are really letting down those from lower socioeconomic status backgrounds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As part of its election policy commitments, the government announced its intention to introduce a two&hyphen;year waiting period before newly arrived migrants could access certain social security payments, and that policy was extended to Austudy as part of the 1996 budget measures. There can be little doubt that the 1996 budget will make the federal  government's student assistance schemes fairer and provide a more efficient use of taxpayers' money. Austudy now will be better targeted. The changes to Austudy, Abstudy and the assistance for isolated children's scheme ensure that students and families who <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have a genuine need for financial assistance benefit the most.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe it is important to place on the record at the beginning of my comments in support of this bill my high regard and admiration for the dedication and purpose of all those who have migrated to this country and who, in the face of all those difficulties and obstacles that come with migration, have excelled in their chosen field of study.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Chifley (Mr Price) mentioned the 1991 report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training into student financial assistance. It is fair to say that the origins of this bill can be traced back to that report. That report highlighted the relative ease with which high income earners could distort their taxable income and therefore enable dependants to receive Austudy. In an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 12 April 1991, Lenore Taylor wrote about students who were in receipt of Austudy `driving to university in their Volvos'. Many members would be aware of anecdotal evidence of this sort of thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very interesting to look at some of the postcode areas and consider what percentage of university students living in those postcode areas are receiving Austudy. If you look at Melbourne, you see that 89 per cent of university students from areas like Springvale are receiving Austudy; in Sunshine, 79 per cent of university students; in Richmond, 92 per cent of university students; and in Footscray, 97 per cent of university students. That is great. Now I will compare that with other areas where students are receiving Austudy: Toorak, 33 per cent; Malvern, 41 per cent; Kew, 43 per cent; and Balwyn, 45 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not suggesting that in the electorate of the member for Higgins (Mr Costello) there are not some people who legitimately deserve Austudy. I am not suggesting there are not some university students who really should have Austudy&mdash;it is hard to say without more evidence&mdash;but my inclination would be to say that it just might be possible that, in Malvern, there could be some university students who, if Austudy were withdrawn, would be able to find either additional family support or an alternative source of income. I believe what <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6781"> is really important is that Austudy should be better targeted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to look at Cabramatta where the situation is very similar. For example, in Cabramatta 84 per cent of university students are receiving Austudy, and in St Ives and Killara the levels are 31 per cent and 27 per cent respectively. It is interesting to note that, of the 2,600 Vietnamese students enrolled at New South Wales universities last year, almost a third came from around the working&hyphen;class Cabramatta area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today we are debating a reasonable bill. This bill is in accordance with the equity and efficiency measures that this government is seeking to implement in all portfolio concerns. In the same way that we are seeking to expose and discontinue the rorts of Australian middle-class parents, so too we are eager to expose and discontinue the loopholes that have existed for overseas parents. It needs to be continually remembered and stressed that the correct role for government in providing financial assistance to students&mdash;the correct role for Austudy&mdash;is to assist those on low incomes, those people who without Austudy would find it very difficult to gain access to higher education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Writing in the journal <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">People and Place</EMPHASIS> in 1994, Ian Dobson, associate to the deputy vice-chancellor, made the simple but valid point that the requirement that overseas born students who do not hold permanent resident status pay a full fee, varying from $9,000 to $25,000 per year, gives such students an incentive to obtain permanent resident status. Later that year, Dobson co-authored a follow-up article with Bob Birrell, Director of the Centre for Population and Urban Research at Monash University, and made the following statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The financial advantages to obtaining resident status (relative to full fee overseas students status) are considerable. Residents contribute to their tertiary education via the Higher Education Contribution Scheme . . . Students can either pay this contribution up front to receive a 25 per cent discount . . . or defer their liability to be repaid (on a sliding scale) via the taxation system . . . However, should a student decide to pay via the deferred tax option, then leave Australia on the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> completion of their course, they may make no contribution at all.</PARA>
<PARA>Such situations have come to be known as the astronaut phenomenon; that is, affluent parents returning to their native country after being granted Australian permanent residency status, leaving their children behind to gain a discounted tertiary education. It is a matter of regret that some wealthy overseas&hyphen;born parents have manipulated Australia's migration program to obtain HECS places and Austudy for their offspring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In February last year, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> reported a spokesman for the then Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, one Ross Free, as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a worry . . . We want Austudy to go into the hands of the right people. Payments could be a little more generous if those not entitled to it were not receiving it.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know Mr Free personally. I have heard his name mentioned in this House over the last couple of months, but I could not agree more with his spokesman. The true role of Austudy is to target it at those who really need it. For every person the government gives shelter to who really does not need it, someone else is left out in the cold. A safety net is vital. It has been important over the last century, but it should not be confused with a blanket that is so encompassing that it actually smothers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Writing in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">People and Place</EMPHASIS> in 1994, Bob Birrell and Ian Dobson examined the issue of Austudy dependence amongst students in Australia and were forced to conclude that there exists a significant loophole in the Austudy system. They wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When persons claiming AUSTUDY report that their parents live overseas Austudy officers require the applicant to produce income and asset records from the home country. Also, parents living in Australia are required to declare income and assets held overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Compliance is far more difficult in those cases than it is in cases where people draw an income only in Australia and who hold assets only in Australia. In those cases Australian tax records and certifying accountants are involved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In cases involving foreign income and assets, Austudy officers have to depend on unreliable foreign tax records for income records and on certifications by foreign accountants specified by <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6782"> the applicant for asset records. So, in effect, compliance is largely voluntary. Short of investing substantial funds in overseas inspections, there is not much that the Australian government can do to rectify the situation.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what Birrell and Dobson said. It has been calculated the Commonwealth government allocates almost $1.5 billion in Austudy benefits each year to students in universities, TAFE colleges and government and non-government schools. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  of 1 July this year, Dobson and Birrell, referring to their previous research, wrote that 12 per cent of the age eligible students attending the top category of private schools were receiving Austudy. In addition, Dobson and Birrell said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(I)n 1995, 49 per cent of Malaysia&hyphen;born and 55 per cent of Hong&hyphen;Kong&hyphen;born university students were receiving Austudy, yet most were recently arrived, from relatively affluent backgrounds (and in many cases likely to leave Australia on completion of their degrees). Indeed, only 4 per cent of both the Malaysian and Hong Kong students were living in low SES postcode areas.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the lower 25 per cent of postcode areas. The authors continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part of the problem is that Austudy eligibility is based on taxable income, thus opening up opportunities for affluent families who can arrange their finances to minimise their taxable income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the case of overseas&hyphen;born students, the problem is that Austudy officials have difficulty assessing the financial situation of families with income or assets overseas. This problem could be solved by refusing access to Austudy to recently arrived migrants, as with the two year waiting period the Coalition is seeking to implement for welfare payments.</PARA>
<PARA>I welcome overseas students to Australia. I believe that they have made an enormous contribution to Australian life and Australian society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The introduction of the Colombo Plan in 1950 had an enormously far-reaching impact in our region and in Australia, and it accelerated Australia's orientation, engagement and role in Asia. It is interesting to note that several ministers from governments in Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia received their education on Australian campuses. They would have had much experience of life in Australia. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The interaction of overseas students with young Australians over the last half century has witnessed Australians and Asians for the first time learning side by side and forming personal relationships. The consequent heightened awareness of Asia amongst Australians of that generation has underpinned Australia's engagement in our region. It has underpinned the changes that we have seen in Australian society over the last 50 years in moving from being a predominantly European society to one that is much more diverse. In my view, it is a diversity that has been achieved by a remarkable degree of tolerance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that plan was enormously far&hyphen;sighted because personal relationships that are formed between people studying, people interacting and people working together are just as important in forming ties with a region as relationships between heads of state and government. I am very proud to have been at Adelaide University during a great expansion in the overseas student program. It was as president of the Medical Students Society that I welcomed many of the students that we had coming from Malaysia as fee paying students. It was a very positive thing for the university.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia now has the ability to offer quality education to students in our region but at a premium to that available in the United States. I believe that this measure will not discourage those overseas students&mdash;and I previously mentioned some cases in an article&mdash;who want to come to Australia, but it will close this loophole whereby people can receive Austudy and then never pay their HECS back by getting permanent resident status.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6783"> This bill introduces a two&hyphen;year or 104&hyphen;week waiting period for access to Austudy, which will apply, with limited exceptions, to all migrants who arrive in Australia on or after 1 July 1997. The present six&hyphen;month period will continue to apply to New Zealand citizens who permanently settle in Australia before 1 January 1997. It is important to note that this bill makes special provision for migrants who are New Zealand citizens because, unlike other migrants who must hold a permanent visa to settle permanently in Australia, New Zealand citizens enter Austral ia on a special category visa which entitles them to remain here indefinitely. In other words, a special category does not distinguish between entry as a permanent settler and entry in a temporary capacity. However, it is intended that as far as practicable migrants from New Zealand should have the two&hyphen;year waiting period applied to them in the same manner it is applied to migrants from other countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently, I received a letter from the Flinders University Postgraduate Students Association wherein the author attacked&mdash;much in the same way as the member for Sydney (Mr Peter Baldwin) and the member for Chifley did this morning&mdash;the government for introducing the bill we are currently debating. The association argued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Access to education and training is of vital importance for migrant people who often have difficulties obtaining employment after arrival in this country. It would seem absolutely contradictory for the government to deny new migrants in their first two years the financial means to obtain the education and training needed to gain employment and to fully participate in society.</PARA>
<PARA>The reservation contained in this statement&mdash;namely, `it would seem . . . contradictory'&mdash;is wisely observed. The member for Chifley spoke about there being a lack of evidence on the performance of the offspring of migrants who have come to Australia. I point out to him that in the August 1995 edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bureau of Immigration Research Bulletin</EMPHASIS> , Dr Siew Ean Khoo commented on the report that she had co-written entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The second generation in Australia: educational and occupational characteristics</EMPHASIS> . In her report, Dr Khoo explains how the 1991 census reveals what was largely already suspected anecdotally&mdash;that is, it is actually the second generation Australians of non-English speaking origins who are achieving the educational credentials well beyond their parents' generation and indeed their parents' generation's expectations. This should come as no surprise. This is something that I welcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Chifley was right when he said that there can be enormous dislocation for some migrants when they come to Australia. That is true. It is not as if a migrant arrives on our shores and suddenly decides <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that he is going to go to university and go to law school, that he is going to go to university and do some professional course or that he is going to go to university and do a BA. There is a period of adjustment. Introducing a two&hyphen;year waiting period for access to Austudy will close that loophole, which I mentioned earlier, for some overseas students, but it will be fairer in that it will allow Austudy to be better targeted at those who need it. It is a sensible measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That same report found that those second generation Australians of non-English speaking origins were outstripping third or earlier generation Australians of the same age group in the area of academic achievement and excellence. That is something which all members of this House should be proud of. We are a nation of migrants. It is significant that the children of migrants can outperform those early arrivals. That is something that should be welcomed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Sydney said that this was one of the nasties contained in the budget. This is not a big measure in the budget. The number of people it will pick up is relatively small. That is evidenced by the fact that it will reduce outlays by $6 million this year and approximately $12 million over the next two years. I commend this bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;The Student and Youth Assistance Amendment (Waiting Period) Bill denies Austudy to most migrants until they have been here for two years. In other words, it extends to Austudy the same waiting period which the government proposes to also have in place for Department of Social Security benefits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is an immigrant society. We always have been and we always will be. It is worth remembering that some 40,000 or 50,000 years ago&mdash;no-one knows exactly when&mdash;the Aborigines migrated here from somewhere in Asia. Two hundred years ago a group of people came here from England. Every year since then, migrants have been arriving in Australia, enriching our culture and boosting our economy.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6784">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Immigration adds an heroic dimension to our national life. Immigration gives us something of the same spirit which the Statue of Liberty exudes over the American nation&mdash;`Bring us your poor, your huddled masses.' We are a less demonstrative people than the Americans but arguably a more successful society because we do not bring immigrants here to dump them in ghettos and we do not bring immigrants here to leave them on the bottom rung of the socioeconomic ladder.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill maintains the generous traditions of Australian society because it exempts from that two-year waiting period all those who come here as refugees and under special humanitarian programs. No-one who is already here will be ambushed by this measure; it only applies to people who arrive after 1 January 1997. I should also point out that, in drafting this bill, the government has taken into account some of the useful suggestions made by the opposition in the minority Senate report into the relevant DSS legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill also maintains the best traditions of our migrants, who have always understood that hard work and commitment to Australia is the secret of success. When the First Fleet disgorged its motley crew on to the shores of Botany Bay and then Sydney Cove 200 or so years ago it was not a very auspicious start to the modern Australian nation. Those people were chosen by the finest judges in England, yet within 100 years they had built a nation that was the envy of the earth. They had built a nation that had the highest standard of living on earth. They did not do it by going on welfare. They did not do it by taking Austudy. They did it by rolling up their sleeves and getting on with things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In more recent times migrants from many different countries&mdash;from much more diverse sources&mdash;have perpetuated those great traditions. Particularly our Asian migrants in recent times have recalled us to the great traditions of small business, of the extended family and of loyalty to one another that perhaps we in Australia were in danger of forgetting. Migrants to this country have done us proud and they have done themselves proud. Both those things have occurred because of the hard work and the commitment <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that they have shown, and that is why most migrants support the provisions of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn briefly to some of the comments of members opposite. I have a lot of sympathy for the member for Sydney (Mr Peter Baldwin) because time and again over the last few months he has been forced to come into this parliament and criticise policies of the new government which are essentially extensions of the principles begun by the former government. The member for Sydney has tried to tell the parliament that it is fine to restrict migrant access to the major DSS benefits for six months but it is in some way evil, wrong and immoral to restrict migrant access to Austudy for two years. It is terrible, shocking, unjust and wrong to have a two-year waiting period but, of course, it was absolutely sensible and right to have a six-month waiting period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem that members opposite have is that they have only discovered this sacred principle that migrants should be entitled to every form of benefit immediately on their arrival since they became the opposition. That forces one to the conclusion that they do not really believe it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I listened in perfect silence to the contributions of members opposite. I think they could extend the same courtesy to the government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We made it very clear pre-election that we thought there should be a general two-year waiting period for benefits. This bill is part of implementing that commitment. Indeed, it was the former government which tried to say that only Australian citizens should be entitled to get Austudy. We are saying that people should get Austudy only after they have been in this country for two years&mdash;that is, at a time when they are entitled to become Australian citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both the member for Sydney and the member for Chifley (Mr Price) tried to tell the House that this bill would produce utter penury, utter poverty and utter destitution <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6785"> amongst migrants. Let us make it very clear that this bill applies only to migrants who do not come in under the humanitarian or refugee programs. Migrants who do come in under the general categories are all, one way or another, supposed to be able to support themselves because they have money, because they have jobs or because they have relatives. If their circumstances change, they will be entitled to DSS benefits. It is as simple as that. For members opposite to talk about poverty, penury and destitution is simple scaremongering. They are trying to scare and terrify the very people who they say they are trying to protect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Listening to members opposite, I am reminded of the words of one of the first great migrant leaders&mdash;the prophet Moses&mdash;who said to the people of Israel, `Sit on your asses and I will lead you to the promised land.' Members opposite seem to be saying, `Sit on your asses and you're in the promised land.' Quite frankly, it utterly demeans our migrants and it utterly sells Australia short.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As we have said throughout this debate, there is no need for the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill 1996. This bridge could be built tomorrow if the government wanted it, and they know it. A few things need to be said at this stage, in fairness to some of the things that have been said in this debate. The first thing I want to do is praise the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), who was attacked yesterday by the member for Moore (Mr Filing), I think quite disgracefully, when he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unfortunately, the then shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs did not do herself proud by the fact that she refused to take the disallowance motion through this House after it had been passed by the shadow cabinet which, at the end of the day, was an obligation required of the then shadow minister, the member for Barker (Mr McLachlan).</PARA>
<PARA>I think the then shadow minister should be praised because what her then shadow cabinet was doing was giving her a poisoned chalice, just as this legislation is a poisoned chalice for the current Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron). There is no need for this legislation. There is no need for this parliament to take sides. There is no need for some of the debate that some of the speakers have engaged in, attacking one side or the other. The former minister for Aboriginal affairs, Robert Tickner, was an honourable member of parliament. He was an honourable minister. I have no hesitation in saying he is a good friend of mine. He will be remembered well by the indigenous community. History will treat him well.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government that attacked him when he was minister for not following due process now brings this legislation into the House, not wanting to follow due process. This government that attacked him for taking sides now wants to take sides. It is being inconsistent. The former minister was honourable and he has an admirable track record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the Ngarrindjeri women, I have met with them and I have visited the Hindmarsh Island area. There is no need for this parliament to sit in judgment of them or on either side of the equation. It is not necessary. It does not help the debate when we have the pious language that was used in the debate last evening and the day before. Justice Mathews says at page 12 of her report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 10 does not require that a declaration be made if the preconditions of Section 10(1)(b) are met. Far from it. The Minister's powers are entirely discretionary.</PARA>
<PARA>Justice Mathews says that because the government is not providing a female minister, and because of Tickner and Western Australia, the women withdrew the limited, restricted knowledge they gave. She also says in her report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the absence of restricted women's knowledge, other issues assume much greater significance under the application . . . All these matters are discussed extensively in chapters 8 and 9 of the report. After considering them carefully I have concluded that whilst they may well make the area a `significant Aboriginal area', there is insufficient material from which the Minister could be satisfied that the building of the Hindmarsh Island bridge would desecrate this area according to these traditions.</PARA>
<PARA>Justice Mathews found that, notwithstanding the obstacles that this government has placed in front of those women. She also found in relation to the credibility of the women, and it is important to put it on the record in view of some of the comments that have been made. Concerning the sincerity of the applicants, she says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is necessary as a preliminary matter to assess the applicants' sincerity when they say that the Hindmarsh Island area is significant for them, particularly as the dissident women in the Royal Commission generally disclaimed any knowledge of the island as a significant place. And I must say that in general I was satisfied of the genuineness of most of the people who made oral submissions to me <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6787"> when they asserted the significance of this area to them.</PARA>
<PARA>Further on, at page 123, she says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I also accept that the applicants' opposition to the building of the Hindmarsh Island bridge is, in general, based upon a genuine belief that the Hindmarsh Island/Goolwa area, including the bridge corridor area, is of great traditional significance to Ngarrindjeri people.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>When I met the women, I found them sincere. When I went to Hindmarsh Island, I found them sincere. I do not need to make a judgment; this parliament does not need to make a judgment. I do not need to make a judgment in relation to the dissident women either. I won't and I never will. I respect their views. I respect the different views of everyone in this debate. But do not come in here in a pious, sanctimonious way and try to claim superiority of one group over the other. That is not the way to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Justice Mathews also blew the lid on the royal commission's finding. She found after forensic testing that Mrs Fisher's account, which she wrote in the late 1960s or early 1970s, was vindicated.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I detected that was a reasonably wide&hyphen;ranging set of comments made by the member for Banks (Mr Melham). I reiterate some of the points that I made yesterday in the second reading debate. The first of these points, as I mentioned in the first instance in that debate, is that the secret women's business proved to be a political forgery. The member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) is here at the table. I made the observation at the time that if you could be politically hanged on more than one occasion&mdash;which is probably the truth in the case of politics&mdash;he was hanged for an offence that he could not possibly have committed. In fact, he took what most members would consider was an honourable course of action, which was to resign to prevent at the time the so&hyphen;called embarrassment to the opposition of a set of papers that were clearly concocted to achieve a particular objective. And that objective was quite clear. The concoction of those papers was to provide the basis on which Mr Tickner, the then Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, could issue an order preventing the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> construction of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge for 25 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Banks, as I mentioned yesterday, may well be sincerely representing his philosophical viewpoints or the philosophical viewpoints of some of the Labor Party, but it is quite clear, in my view, that the Labor Party is divided on this issue. The Labor Party, I would say, would consider this&mdash;certainly the ones who are rational thinkers in the Labor Party would consider&mdash;to have been one of the blackest moments in its more recent political history. It used a political forgery to mount a political attack on the member for Barker and, I might add, in order to support a decision by a minister to issue an order based on no evidence whatsoever. In fact, the then minister not only relied on the forgery on which to base his argument but actually did not look at it. Not only is that incompetent but he neglected his duty to the Commonwealth, to the rest of the community, to exercise his powers as a minister in a responsible manner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of this bill, in essence, is to facilitate the very process for which this forgery was concocted to prevent. I made the observation yesterday&mdash;and I will perhaps strengthen that observation because there was a hypocritical element in this&mdash;that the process was under way whilst there was a Labor state government in South Australia. It was only when the Liberal government was elected as the government of South Australia that we saw the move towards the blocking of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge construction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6788"> The member for Barker, as he has mentioned on other occasions, as the local member did not personally favour the construction of the bridge. But he took on the case and, as a consequence of his actions, the then coalition shadow executive supported a disallowance motion in relation to the minister's order. At the time, there was an extraordinary campaign in the media based on this lie, the women's business, which was used to vilify a member representing the interests of constituents. Of course, the irony of all this is that, because of the actions of the Bannon and Arnold Labor governments, the South Australian government inherited a substantial finan cial liability. So we have this supreme hypocrisy that the previous Labor state administration, having launched the construction of the bridge, used the Labor Party federal minister in this way to prevent the construction of the bridge and, as I say, at the time incurred potentially a financial liability of many millions of dollars. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>This amendment will be seconded by my colleague the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr). I move this amendment because, sadly, the word of the government cannot be trusted. More significantly, the word of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) cannot be trusted. It is not what you say; it is what you do. You say all the right things, but you do all the wrong things. Coalition policy states that it will respect the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act. That is all this amendment does. The first question I as a shadow minister asked the Prime Minister in this parliament was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister give a commitment to this House that the government will not seek to repeal, suspend or override the Racial Discrimination Act of 1975?</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>The opening words of the Prime Minister were:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has no plans to introduce any amendments to the Racial Discrimination Act . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In response to other questions that he has been asked and in other speeches that he has made, the Prime Minister has said that the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government will respect the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act. Our objection to this bill is that it does not respect the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act. It is not consistent with the Racial Discrimination Act, nor has the government in its own proceedings presented it in such a way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the day before this legislation was introduced the minister sent us a copy and a copy of legal advice on a confidential basis. That legal advice was prepared without the bill being sighted. What is interesting is the minister then issued a press release. He says in the press release that it is not retrospective and that the legislation is not racially discriminatory because it does not stop anyone applying for a protection declaration. He said in his letter to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) on 16 October:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you will see from the Bill, I have also taken account of your concerns about retrospectivity and the Racial Discrimination Act. The Bill is consistent with the RDA and is not retrospective.</PARA>
<PARA>What is interesting is that those words are not repeated in the bill or in the second reading speech of the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles), who presented this bill in the House. I am saying that they were intentionally not included in the second reading speech, and the situation is that those words are not mirrored in the legislation. They are not present in the second reading speech because paragraph 15AB(2)(f) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, on use of extrinsic material in the interpretation of an act, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the speech made to a House of the Parliament by a Minister on the occasion of the moving by that Minister of a motion that the Bill containing the provision be read a second time in that House;</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, in interpreting this bill the courts can have a look at the second reading speech of the minister presenting the bill. That is why there is nothing in there about retrospectivity. That is why there is nothing in the second reading speech about the RDA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is relying on the latter act overriding the earlier act. That is not consistency. You only have to have a look at what the Parliamentary Research Service says:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6789">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The general view is that the Commonwealth Parliament is a sovereign Parliament and thus may enact later legislation which derogates from or repeals an earlier statute.</PARA>
<PARA>In relation to retrospectivity, it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In any event, even if the Bill had a retrospective effect, there appears to be no bar on the Commonwealth making retrospective legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge), who is at the table, let the cat out of the bag in his reply last night. He said&mdash;and he was indebted to the minister who had given him advice on the matter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the amendment were totally benign, perhaps we could look at it differently.</PARA>
<PARA>What the amendment does is give primacy to the Racial Discrimination Act and that is consistent with what it should be. We should not be passing legislation intentionally or unintentionally that cuts away from the Racial Discrimination Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a discriminatory bill. This is a bill that overrides the Racial Discrimination Act. It is not consistent with it. That is why the government has not put those words in the second reading speech. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Notwithstanding that a seconder is not required, I am delighted to speak as if I were a seconder of this amendment. It is important for this parliament to recognise the context in which this amendment is moved. It is moved in a context where we say essentially this whole package of legislation is quite unnecessary. The only reason to bring this legislation before the parliament is, as Mr Filing suggests, to attribute blame. It is a partisan act whose political motive is transparent but in effect it undoes one of the areas where this government had had some moral authority. It had some moral authority because, in its undertakings to this House, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) had said that it never had the intention of undermining the Racial Discrimination Act or to be in conflict with it.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs could now give authorisation for that bridge to proceed. In fact, had the minister acted expeditiously&mdash;and there is a request for authorisation which has been before him for some considerable time&mdash;the bridge could have been built now. It could have been going ahead now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This delay is entirely the government's responsibility and any responsibility that flows from it should be sheeted home to the government that wishes to bring legislation into this parliament so it can point a finger at an opposition and say, `You are the persons who remain responsible for the delay.' That is an appalling state of events.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say simply as a lawyer that it is entirely implausible to say, `This legislation is consistent, but we will not in the second reading speech or in the explanatory memorandum commit ourselves in any way to a statement which has that impact.' It is also implausible for the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs in this House to say, `If this were benign, if it had no effect of overriding the Racial Discrimination Act, then we might have accepted your amendment.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The implausibility, the inconsistency and the legal stupidity of that position is so transparent that it does not need somebody such as me, who once had the dignity and honour of this parliament of being the Attorney-General and the Minister for Justice, to point that out. It does not need anybody. Any two&hyphen;bob lawyer who has just come out <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6790"> of university would be able to make the obvious connection that, if you say there is a complete consistency with the RDA, you should have no objection to placing within the legislation something which makes that transparently clear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But you shy away from anything in the second reading speech or in the explanatory memorandum that gives effect to the legal interpretation that the government says it has. Then you say that, if this regulation was benign, you would accept it. You are basically arguing both sides at the same time. It is implausible; it is foolish. It is against a background where this whole legislative approach is completely unnecessary. It is driven for political motivations and reveals a contempt for the people that the government is purporting to represent who actually want the bridge to go ahead.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak again in this debate about the failure of the government to accept the amendment put forward by the opposition with regard to the Racial Discrimination Act. It seems to me extraordinary that this occurs just one week after we have a bipartisan resolution carried by this parliament, talking about commitment to reconciliation, talking about commitment to anti-discrimination, talking about commitment to multiculturalism and talking about the opposition of this parliament to the increased climate of racism.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This increased climate of racism has been engendered by the first speech of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson), and then by the subsequent failure of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to show leadership on the racism issue. Added to that we have had the arguments put forward by the Prime Minister, firstly, on free speech which gave encouragement and the green light to those racist elements in our society to vilify and to attack the most vulnerable members of our society. Secondly, we had the Prime Minister talking about how the education system should not make us feel guilty. It was as if the invasion and occupation of Australia 200 years ago was not resisted by anybody. He said that in the education process in our schools we should not cover the real history of Australia.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the context of that debate, for this parliament not to accept the amendment moved by the member for Banks (Mr Melham), supporting the Racial Discrimination Act and saying that the Racial Discrimination Act&mdash;effectively Australia's bill of rights&mdash;should not be overridden by this legislation, sends a reactionary message out there to all of our constituents which is in stark contrast with the message which this parliament in a bipartisan way attempted to send last week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's justification for knocking back these amendments to the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill&mdash;they would accept them if these amendments were benign&mdash;suggests that there is something discriminatory about the way the bill is framed. You cannot have it both ways. This whole legislation, as we have pointed out last night and again today, is unnecessary. Hindmarsh bridge can go ahead. There is no need for this legislation to be pursued at all. But then, on top of that, to oppose the amendment put forward by the member for  Banks really shows a lack of judgment on behalf of the government.

Quite clearly, the legislation is necessary because of the advice received by the government from the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) that, in order for the Hindmarsh bridge to be built, it would require another report. Then there are all the other ancillary legal issues that arise from that. Having been accomplices to the most outrageous political fraud in recent Australian history, the Labor Party are now trying to save face. They acknowledge the fact that this, in essence, was one of the most unsavoury episodes in its last term of government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former minister lost his seat because he lost credibility, and one of the reasons he lost credibility was over this whole fiasco. The fact of the matter is that, at the end of the day, we saw the concoction of a fraud, a forgery, to be used as a political weapon in a divisive and calculated way&mdash;in a way that undermined substantially the credibility of what was then the process of reconciliation, a cross-party process to which the Labor Party continually refers but gives lip-service at times when it wants to make political capital out of something quite as sad as this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous speaker made some comments on the race debate and the joint house statement, and all the rest of it. Frankly, there is nothing more calculated to undermine the process of reconciliation, the process of improving community relations between indigenous people and the rest of the community, than the sort of process we have seen in relation to the Hindmarsh Island Bridge affair. Quite clearly, this matter has got so long in the tooth that there is nothing more the government can do other than to enact legislation that empowers the construction of the bridge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As was pointed out in the second reading speech of the minister in the Senate, which I commend for reading to the shadow minister:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The minister has considered appointing another reporter . . . While this appears to be the process least likely to cause concern, the recent history of the administration of the act&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>obviously will `be no guarantee of a satisfactory outcome' and will cause `potentially further substantive costs to the taxpayer'. The <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> problem is that we have a process that has taken an extraordinary amount of time to be satisfactorily resolved. We know that there are a number of ways in which people could delay this issue further. It has cost the taxpayer an extraordinary, extortionate amount of money in order to be able to get to this stage. Now we are in the process of trying to resolve this fiasco from the previous government's use of ministerial powers and ministerial order to prevent the process of construction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have sat and read the amendment of the member for Banks (Mr Melham). I have given it proper consideration. All I can say to him is: I am not acting in some way that is toeing a party line or as a cipher. But I cannot in all honesty see this as anything other than a face&hyphen;saving exercise for an opposition that is totally discredited on this issue. In my view&mdash;and I know that the member for Banks will probably disagree with this&mdash;all I can say is that, from recent public comment on the matter, it is evident there is a division of opinion in the Labor Party in relation to the Hindmarsh Island Bridge affair, and this is a face&hyphen;saving device to try to give the best possible gloss on this absolutely unsavoury episode.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I had been a member of the Labor Party and the Labor government at the time, as was the member for Banks, I would shy away from this as much as possible because this will go down, as I mentioned yesterday, as one of the great political forgeries in modern times and anybody associated with supporting it would have to have, I think, some very serious problems with their political judgment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is what I had to say during the racial tolerance debate, a motion that was unanimously carried by this parliament. I said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6792">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Racial Discrimination Act of 1975 is special to all of us. It is pleasing that all sides of this House have in their policy respect for the principles of this act. This act is our bill of rights. This act makes us all equal. As parliamentarians, we should at all times strive to maintain the principles behind this motion and every subsequent piece of legislation in this parliament should respect the Racial Discrimination Act.</PARA>
<PARA>And why shouldn't it? Otherwise, the resolution that we passed last week can be discounted quite properly as weasel words&mdash;as, `Yes, we can say this but we do not really mean it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government accepts our amendment, it will be a clear demonstration. We have been given assurances; we do not accept the assurances. The government says one thing and its actions reveal another. The very fact is that the minister let the cat out of the bag. He was given advice from the actual minister. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I am indebted to the minister who has given me advice on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA>Further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the amendment were totally benign, perhaps we could look at it differently.</PARA>
<PARA>The amendment is a serious amendment; it says that the parliament should respect the Racial Discrimination Act&mdash;and if they are not prepared to support that, what does it say? It lets the cat out of the bag because it says that they are not all that confident that their legislation is not discriminatory. What they are confident of is that the later legislation will prevail. That is what they are saying. They say that it is consistent with the Racial Discrimination Act; we say that it is not. If this legislation was consistent with the Racial Discrimination Act, you would accept the amendment. The minister continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second thing that we are advised is that this is a precedent that has not been set and would provide a precedent for other legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>What is wrong with this precedent in the current climate? Why shouldn't this parliament assert, reassert and continue to reassert what is in every major political party's policy: respect for the Racial Discrimination Act? We on this side want more than words because of where this government is heading in this whole race debate. If they vote against this amendment, they will be seen for just uttering <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the words but not being fair dinkum. People will not believe you. The minister further stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thirdly, if we agreed to the amendment, and in the unlikely event that our advice was incorrect&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and it has not been good up to now&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and the bill was in fact in breach of the RDA, then the bill would be ineffective to close off a section 10 process . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Well then, it should be. If it is in breach of the RDA, if it is discriminatory, then it should be struck down. The point is: it is all so unnecessary because there is no protection order in existence. There is an excellent article written by Alan Ramsey in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  on Wednesday, 6 November 1996 in relation to Boobera Lagoon in New South Wales where the minister has been sitting on a positive report since 22 April. Mr Ramsey says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Parliament last night, the House of Representatives was scheduled to begin debating a piece of "special" legislation to resolve the Hindmarsh Island bridge controversy. The Government insists the bill is necessary to ensure the legality of the bridge being built. What the legislation really does, though, is bring Hindmarsh Island back into sharp public focus in South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Further on he states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . what Herron insists needs special legislation in South Australia does not, it seems, in a parallel case in NSW, need legislation of any kind to achieve the same end.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That end is to say "no" to Aboriginal claims under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act, whatever their merits or otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, the minister was taken to court and they were successful in New South Wales. Foster J. on 17 October 1996 in Sydney declined to give interlocutory relief because it was held that the minister had an absolute discretion and that the relief that the Aboriginal people were seeking was not available.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> (Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS>  The relief was not granted. This is with a positive report because there is no dispute. In that instance there is no protection order. The minister cannot be compelled to issue a protection order. So desecration is occurring at the Boobera Lagoon in New South Wales and indigenous people cannot do anything about it. All they <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6793"> can do is get the minister to consider the positive report that he has been given, and he will do that in due course after consulting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same principles apply. The legislation has been tested in the Federal Court. It has gone all the way to the High Court and now this minister has the benefit. That is why, when we say `Follow due process,' you can use the evidentiary material from the Mathews report. You do not need to breach the Racial Discrimination Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us say that your advice is wrong. In the current climate with this Prime Minister's track record dating back to 1988, isn't this stupid legislation? He gave a solemn commitment to the electorate and a solemn commitment to this parliament time and time again to respect the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act, but what happens with the first test he has? He says, `Sorry. This is unnecessary. We are not voting for this amendment.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation is that the government need to be very careful because they are going to lose all credibility in relation to this. I think it is fair to say, as Frank Brennan says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In receiving advice . . . as to whether the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill "respects the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act", it would be no defence for the government to be left dependent on . . . advice . . . that "The proposed legislation could not be subject to successful legal challenge on the basis that it is inconsistent with the Racial Discrimination Act. As a later enactment, the proposed legislation would not be subject to the Racial Discrimination Act."</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would be regrettable if the government were to legislate a later specific act inconsistent with the Racial Discrimination Act such that to the extent of the inconsistency the latest specific Act were to negate the effect of section 10(1) of the Racial Discrimination Act. The later Act could not be presented as one which "respects the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act".</PARA>
<PARA>That is why the government is opposing this amendment. What we have done is put their weights up. That is material that the minister has been given, not by a legal person. But he has been written to and he knows that. That is why those words `this is consistent with the Racial Discrimination Act and this legislation is not retrospective' do not appear in the second reading speech. This bill is inconsistent with the Racial Discrimination Act, and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> they know it. They are just not being fair dinkum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the Racial Discrimination Act, there is hypocrisy in the government at the moment. In relation to the race debate, we seem to be saying that what has happened to Asian Australians is a disgrace and saying it is mea culpa. But that is capitalism suffering. We are not getting the same mea culpa in relation to Aboriginal people. They are still being blamed. In the last couple of days we have had newspapers running around attacking salaries for the SES officers in ATSIC&mdash;salaries that are subject to Public Service regulations, salaries that are consistent with what is happening throughout the Public Service. But it is only the ATSIC people who are being attacked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what this legislation does. It singles people out. It blames them. What we say is: the government won. The minister is there. He has the absolute discretion. There is no protection order in existence. Follow due process. You have our support. There is no need for this debate. There is no need to take sides. If you want to take sides with the developers, good luck to you. You are entitled to do that, but do not do it by attacking indigenous people. Do not do it by bringing in an act that is inconsistent with the Racial Discrimination Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do not come in here and use weasel words in everything but the second reading speech&mdash;in press releases and when briefing the gallery and then, when you are asked to put up or shut up, you slink away and oppose an amendment that is fundamental, that says that the Racial Discrimination Act is paramount. It is in your policy and it is in the utterances of your Prime Minister. But when you are tested you walk away. You walk away because you are not confident in your legal advice. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> We are confident in our legal advice. We are confident that, as a result of the tabling of the Mathews report, there is sufficient material. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister can have this bridge wrapped up very quickly without this special legislation. If they are worried about further judicial review, they should follow due process. We say that he does not need to do anything <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6794"> further because there is sufficient material to invoke the Tickner v. Bropho exception. That would show that further pursuit of this application would be frivolous or vexatious. But the more conservative view is&mdash;the view that Father Frank Brennan puts and the view that others put&mdash;that you can go through, by receiving the material that the minister tabled in the Senate, another quick inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Wilson case in the High Court says that it does not have to be public. You can do it within 28 days. That is an option. That does not breach the Racial Discrimination Act. That is safer. What we say on this side is that if you want to persist with this discriminatory legislation, then do it by supporting our amendment, which sends a clear message. It says, and the government can rely on this, `If we did breach the RDA we didn't mean to do so.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the Prime Minister's words are to mean anything, if he says he respects the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act, then how can he vote against the amendment we are putting up? They vote against it because they are not sure. Because it involves indigenous people, they want to take the short cut. We on this side will not take any short cuts in relation to the Racial Discrimination Act. We regard it as paramount. Time and time again, we will reaffirm our commitment to the Racial Discrimination Act. That is how you send the message to Asia and to the racists in the community that we are all equal, irrespective of our race and irrespective of our religion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has happened since the Prime Minister has been reinvented, since he resumed the leadership in opposition and since he came into the prime ministership after 2 March, is that there has been a new McCarthyism in this country, based on the colour of someone's skin. The first targets were indigenous people and the second targets were Asian Australians, and it is a disgrace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is no good passing resolutions about racial tolerance if, on the first test of the primacy of the Racial Discrimination Act, this government votes against this amendment. What it leaves you open to is the allegation, and the only inference, that you are not fair <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> dinkum, that you do not believe in it, that you are just uttering the words.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Your body language and your action says it all. Your action in voting against this amendment says where you stand. Your action in voting against this amendment says that you are not confident in your advice that this bill respects the Racial Discrimination Act. And this bill does not. It does not because it is aimed at a class of person: indigenous people who enjoy the benefits of the Heritage Protection Act. It is only indigenous Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who can invoke the provisions of the Heritage Protection Act. Legislation aimed at taking away an existing right, aimed at taking away a right that these people currently enjoy, is aimed at a class of person. It is aimed only at these indigenous people. That is what this legislation does. That is why it has got problems with the Racial Discrimination Act and that is why the government will not accept our amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The thing is that it is all so unnecessary. There is no protection order in existence. The bridge can be built tomorrow, and the minister cannot be compelled. He cannot be compelled to build the bridge. He cannot be compelled to issue a protection order. If he was silly enough to issue a protection order, the government has the numbers in terms of a disallowance motion. So this is a charade. It is a charade that will further divide the community in South Australia. It is a charade that should be put to an end. The government should back off on this legislation. They should accept our amendment. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have proposed to add to clause 3, page 2, after the definition of `pit area', the following definition: Racial Discrimination Act means Racial Discrimination Act 1975. Let us be clear. What the government just did was vote against a clause that respects the primacy of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. What a disgraceful performance from a government which says that it respects the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That says it all. You cannot rely on the word of the government. You need to take note of what they do in action, not what they say. They have just voted against it. The Racial Discrimination Act, as we have said on this side, is paramount. I have received certain advice, and it is worth while quoting aspects of that advice. One says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am asked to advise whether it is necessary for the Government, in order to resolve the existing application for a declaration under Section 10 of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act, 1984 of land the subject of a report by Justice Mathews of 27.6.96 (now tabled in the Senate) and to avoid having to consider future applications, to pass legislation having the effect of exempting the land that would be affected otherwise by such claims from the operation of the Act. I am also asked to advise generally as to the effect of such legislation, if passed, on the Racial Discrimination Act.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has been a deal of litigation and Parliamentary debate.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6796"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Neither the High Court nor anyone else has impugned the integrity or accuracy of the information in the report. Although it has been suggested that, by reason of the High Court decision, the Report is not a Report for the purposes of the Act it has not been nor rationally could it be suggested that the materials in the Report, the earlier Report, and available from the Royal Commission are not exhaustive and available to the Minister. A further report would yield no more nor does it seem that it could reasonably reach any other conclusion.</PARA>
<PARA>That is something the minister said in his second reading speech. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The terms "frivolous and vexatious" do not occur in the Act nor is there any specific reference to the abuse of process doctrine but these concepts or analogies appropriate to administrative law are well known in the general law. Neither in courts of law nor administratively does the law require that a decision maker armed with all the material embark on an arid exercise fore&hyphen;doomed to failure. An application which unarguably could only fail would be frivolous and vexatious and to persist with such an application when "the material pointed unmistakably in this direction" would be to abuse the processes required by the act for the purposes of Section 10. These concepts are aimed at (inter alia) avoiding such a waste.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the circumstances, it is my view that the present application is, in light of all the material already available, such an application and thus the machinery of the Act is no longer invoked. There is no practical potential in a new Report or inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA>The supplementary advice, given after the act was produced, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have already advised that to persist with the present application where it is clear that there is, presently, no evidence which would warrant a declaration i.e. capable of satisfying the Minister a declaration should be made, and where after exhaustive inquiries there is presently, unmistakably, no real prospect any such evidence would be produced, is to invoke the machinery of the Act to no purpose and is frivolous and vexatious such that the Minister need take no further steps in relation to it.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is therefore no need for legislation. Indeed, it is most peculiar for a Minister to be relieved of a statutory discretion, in a particular case by legislation solely directed to that case, where on the facts no need for the exercise of the Ministerial discretion arises. The only circumstance in which it might be appropriate is where the Minister considers that absent the legislation it might be <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> necessary for a declaration to be made i.e. that there would be substance in an application.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to remove the efficacy of an already made application to defeat the statutory consequence is retrospective in that sense.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is to discriminate in this particular case and to do so on the basis of Aboriginality.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what one senior counsel in New South Wales has had to say about this legislation. Another senior counsel who was consulted by me and the opposition on the questions that arise said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What is the effect of this proposed legislation? Is it necessary?</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Act has retrospective effect since it prevents a claim presently on foot from being completed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It also has prospective effect, since it prevents any claim ever being made in relation to these areas, no matter what the basis of the claims might be.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the present application can be determined according to law quickly and fairly.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In my opinion, this proposed legislation offends against the spirit of the provisions . . . of the Racial Discrimination Act, 1975. Were it State legislation, I would have no doubt that it would be invalid . . .</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS>  That QC's opinion goes further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The contravention comes from the exclusion or restriction from exercising a legal right which comes from a retrospective legislative depravation of an entitlement to make an application, applied only to one group of persons, namely the aboriginal applicants seeking a declaration in relation to the areas intended to be built on by the Hindmarsh Island Bridge.</PARA>
<PARA>In conclusion:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There is no need for the proposed legislation, which is bad in principle because it retrospectively removes the rights of a small section of the indigenous population, for no apparent important public purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The proposed legislation infringes the spirit of the Racial Discrimination Act, 1975 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is a second QC's opinion. The key to this is that, if it were state legislation, it would fail for breaching the Racial Discrimination Act. This government relies on the fact <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6797"> that this will be a later act so it will override the Racial Discrimination Act. That is why there is nothing in the second reading speech of the minister giving the undertaking that it does not breach the spirit of the Racial Discrimination Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also unnecessary. We do not need to bring into question the legal opinions on whether this does or does not infringe the Racial Discrimination Act. It can all be done without legislation&mdash;and in a quicker way. It is not now a priority of the government. It is not going to get on the Senate paper until next year. The government has been too smart by half. There is no protection order currently in existence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) follows due process&mdash;something they attacked the previous minister for&mdash;the bridge would be guaranteed. The minister at the table, the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge), really needs to answer a couple of questions in relation to the Racial Discrimination Act. What do you mean by `benign'? Does our amendment do more than just preserve the RDA? That is the point. That is where the game is up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suggest that, once this goes through the House of Representatives, the government should come and have a talk to us in a proper, constructive fashion. It can be done without the need for sending this signal, without the need for having on our statute books a piece of legislation that breaches the spirit of the Racial Discrimination Act, a piece of legislation that is discriminatory, that is not necessary and that sends the wrong signal to the community and to the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill says, `If you are in this country and the colour of your skin is black, then you don't count.' That is what happened when the government voted against respecting the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. That is what this debate is all about. The Racial Discrimination Act makes us all equal. No government at a federal level, at a local level, at a state level or at a territory level should ever override or suspend the Racial Discrimination Act. That act makes us <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> all equal. It is the most important act on our statute books.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every piece of legislation that this government brings into this parliament that affects indigenous people, in my opinion, should have the qualifier that we respect the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act. That is the overriding principle that should be guiding us all. That is where this legislation is flawed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is all so unnecessary. This debate did not need to take place in this chamber. It is a debate that shows this government has no confidence in the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs in his administration of the act. We should be debating the Heritage Protection Act in light of Justice Elizabeth Evatt's fine report that was tabled in the Senate and in this place. It is a fine review. It shows that the act itself is deficient in protecting Aboriginal heritage and Aboriginal culture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a shameful day when a political party has its Prime Minister saying, `We will respect the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act,' and then comes in and votes against a clause. The minister gave it away, as did the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan) when he talked in his contribution about the later act prevailing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They know exactly what this clause means. They know exactly the dangers of this legislation. My view is that you cannot say enough. It is a precedent we should be setting. It is a precedent that says that if this act inadvertently breaches the RDA then the RDA should prevail. Today is a sad day for this parliament. The resolution we passed last week has been shown up for what it is&mdash;weasel words. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the member for Banks (Mr Melham) has <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6798"> chosen unwisely to dwell on a number of issues that do not contribute to a better understanding of why this debate is taking place and why the government has actually moved this legislation to overcome the dilemma, the paradox, of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge affair. I want to make the point in relation to the member for Banks's contribution that there is no point in relying on the report of Justice Mathews. As he well knows, Justice Mathews' appointment was deemed by the High Court to be invalid.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole difficulty with this is that, in all the processes of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge affair, those people involved in the Labor Party's campaign on the matter have relied on defective material. We know, for instance, that in the first instance Professor Saunders' report was quite clearly defective. We know from other anthropological research that it did not bear up to proper scrutiny. In fact, anybody who took the trouble to investigate the Hindmarsh Island Bridge affair would know that there was substantial anthropological material available to not only rebut those findings of the Saunders report but also put at rest or put paid to many of the contentions of those involved in the opposition campaign, the Labor Party campaign, to prevent the bridge from being constructed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said earlier, the ultimate irony of all this is that the member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) personally opposed the construction of the bridge in the first place. But he chose to act in a principled manner and represent the interests of his constituents. The Labor Party, on the other hand, chose to treat this matter in a way that was not only highly politicised and dishonest but also reliant on material that was so substantially defective that it not only made much of the argument ridiculous but, under closer scrutiny, proved the minister to be acting in a manner that no judicial authority would support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, in every single judicial review of the minister's acts in this matter he was quite clearly shown to have acted in a way which was not only contrary to the act but negligent as a result of the way he treated the secret women's business because he did not do the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> job he was paid to do and supposed to do on behalf the rest of the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make an observation about the resolution the House passed last week on this matter. If you look carefully at the way the Labor Party is acting, its modus operandi, it is quite clearly using this motion as a lever to try to advance any particular proposition it wants to, in much the same manner as the then Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Mr Tickner, used to do in this place.

Every time you said something he would immediately label you as some sort of racist. He was the minister. He had the responsibilities under the act and he failed to fulfil his responsibilities. He was an accomplice in the advancement of a forgery. As a consequence of his acts, he encompassed all of the Labor Party members into that forgery.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a government that lacks any vision for the manufacturing industry and any commitment to it. And it lacks a minister prepared to take on Treasury to fight for the manufacturing industry of Australia. The Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 confirms both these facts. That is why we are opposing it. It is not just the axing of the bounties contained in this legislation which betrays the manufacturers of this country. There are also the cuts to research and development, the significant scaling back of the DIFF scheme, the huge cuts to the export market development grants scheme, the cuts to Austrade and the cuts to AusIndustry. All up, $3.9 billion has been cut by way of industry support over four years in the Howard government's first budget. No wonder the manufacturers of this country feel under siege from this government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are not decisions which are driven by good sense. They are simply driven by the budget bottom line; by a belief that fiscal consolidation will solve all our problems. It will not. These cuts have no regard for the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> real consequences that will flow. The consequences are a loss of economic growth, a loss of jobs and a loss of exports. The budget was bad in many ways, but it singled out manufacturing for very harsh treatment. According to the Industry Commission, Commonwealth assistance to industry will this year hit an eight&hyphen;year low. But it gets worse. Next year it will fall by a further seven per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The resources sector got off relatively lightly in the budget. The diesel fuel rebate was retained&mdash;correctly, in our view&mdash;but only at the cost of the 150 per cent research and development tax concession. That was the trade&hyphen;off to prop up Tim Fischer's leadership of the National Party. It was not a very clever investment either way. So political expediency and the government's lack of vision have hit manufacturing twice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In spite of all of the rhetoric of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) about the need for his government to be seen and judged on the creation of jobs, the Prime Minister is desperate to avoid the T&hyphen;word: he is not prepared to set a target for jobs. But before the election the government, through the now Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore), did set a jobs target to create 200,000 jobs in the manufacturing industry by the year 2000. Having set that target and then come into office, the government has done nothing to achieve it. The industry minister, who has now joined us in the chamber, admits that he has not even bothered to ask his department how the target is to be achieved. They hope that the issue will go away. But the minister must now take a submission to the cabinet unemployment committee, which was recently established by the Prime Minister, in which he outlines a vision for manufacturing and proposes how to achieve the 200,000 jobs he said they would achieve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Industry groups such as the Australian Electrical and Electronic Manufacturing Association, AEEMA; the Australian Information Industries Association, AIIA; the Heavy Engineering Manufacturers Association, HEMA; and the Metal Trades Industry Association, MTIA, together with industry leaders such as Bert Evans, Frank Conroy from Howard Smith Industries and Bob Clifford, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6801"> the catamaran operator from Incat in Tasmania, have been lamenting the government's lack of industry policy. They have been scathing in their criticism of the government in this regard. Even ACCI, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the government's most dogged defender, have been reduced to saying&mdash;only after pregnant pauses&mdash;that the jury is still out on whether the government have an industry policy. The jury is not out, because there is no industry policy under this government. This bill proves it. It is just one of many reasons why the 200,000 target will not be met by them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In opposing the bill and to highlight that fact, I am proposing to move the following amendment to effectively have the bill renamed the Bounty Legislation (Export of Australian Jobs) Amendment Bill:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"the House rejects outright the Government's failure to develop and implement a policy for Australian manufacturing industry, and is of the view that because of the inevitable impact this bill will have on employment the bill would be more appropriately referred to as the Bounty Legislation (Export of Australian Jobs) Amendment Bill".</PARA>
<PARA>We have repeatedly asked in this parliament of the Prime Minister that he apply his own jobs test to government policy decisions. Having announced his cabinet unemployment committee, he told parliament that his test would:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ask of every policy initiative: . . . would it contribute to a generation of jobs?</PARA>
<PARA>This week we asked the Prime Minister to refer to his unemployment committee the impact of the bounty cuts on companies such as Incat, Austal Shipping, Griffin Press and Laser Lab. What was his answer? He says the decisions cannot be disaggregated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the Prime Minister's claim that his unemployment committee will consider each initiative against his jobs test is meaningless. His response to those who have been hit by the cut is to dismiss them as whingers. The 1,600 bounty recipients are just whingers. One company alone&mdash;Austal Shipping in Coogee near Fremantle in Western Australia&mdash;has lost $225 million in contracts because of the decision to abolish the bounty: $225 <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> million in contracts lost at a saving to the budget of $9 million. It is not just the company and its employees that suffer; the nation suffers. Yet the Prime Minister wants to dismiss these complaints as just whingeing. Either he does not understand the impact of or know about these decisions because his industry minister does not tell him&mdash;he didn't tell him too much about his share dealings&mdash;or he does not care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation typifies the coalition's approach to industry policy: that, as in many other areas, there is no role for government and that government should get out of the way. It should abandon the field and let the market rip. That is not Labor's approach. We are committed to a more interventionist industry policy. We have been consulting with industry, both individual firms and their representative bodies. We have been visiting their sites, talking with them about their vision for growth and how to achieve it. Ours is not a tops down, Canberra driven approach; rather, it is about developing a partnership, getting a commitment from industry to set targets for growth in net value added exports, to identify what is needed to achieve those targets and to work with us in government to realise them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6802"> Because it is industry driven, not government driven, the intervention or assistance by government will vary. It may mean better addressing market access issues, it may mean measures which encourage innovation and commercialisation across industry sectors. It may come through the leverage of government purchasing, or it may be like the bounty approach which this legislation abolishes, an approach which, while giving some sector specific assistance, does it in the context of what our competitors provide. It can phase down if the other countries do likewise, but it is more about levelling what is already a tilted playing field. In all cases, it will not be about propping up inefficient industries or firms; it will be supportive of best practice and international competitiveness. It will require a commitment to improve our net exports. It is an approach which we are committed to developing with Australian based industries and, without such an ap proach, jobs in manufacturing simply will disappear overseas.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some export strategy by this government!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Manufacturing is the backbone of this country's industry. It provides the critical mass. It is the means for value adding to our natural resource base, for becoming a clever country by applying our innovation and research. It is the basis for our wealth creation. It is the basis for our jobs in regions. It is the basis for spawning our small to medium&hyphen;sized businesses and it is the basis for driving our services sector. This bill runs counter to all of those things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill axes four industry bounties. Despite election promises to the contrary, it terminates the ships, books, machine tools and robot bounties from budget night. It also abolishes the computer bounty but not, interestingly enough, until 1 July next year. We have asked in this parliament how the inherent conflict of interest this raises, given the industry minister's considerable interest in companies that claim the computer bounty, can be explained, and he chooses to dismiss such requests. We will continue to pursue him. The Prime Minister says there is no conflict of interest, it is an arms&hyphen;length arrangement. No&hyphen;one in the country believes your arms&hyphen;length arrangement, Minister. What nonsense!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decision to end the ships bounty is indefensible. The government wants to strip away the five per cent support for Australian builders of vessels, nearly all of which are exported. In the eight years since Labor introduced the bounty, the Australian industry in shipbuilding has grown massively. It is now the world leader in high speed passenger catamaran production. Industry production has grown by 200 per cent, exports are up by 150 per cent and employment is up by 50 per cent. Other countries continue to maintain subsidies for their shipbuilding industries, for the ones that the catamaran producers have to compete with. Norway, for example, has a subsidy of 13.2 per cent; Denmark, 13 per cent; and Italy, up to 25 per cent. That is against Australia's five per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia can compete with those countries with the higher rates of subsidies with Australia's subsidy at only five per cent, but <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> it cannot compete at zero. The OECD agreement to end shipbuilding subsidies by the end of 1998 will now, I am informed, not go ahead because the Americans will not sign up to it. The minister&mdash;great help that he is&mdash;has written to Austal Ships confirming that the government thinks Australia should take the lead in dismantling assistance. Taking the lead is fine, Minister, if others follow. If they do not, it is suicidal, yet that is the path you have put them on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This indefensible position becomes totally unsustainable when compared with the government's decision to continue the ships capital grants scheme. Just understand the stupidity of this position for those on the other side who want to chortle. The government has been able to find $23 million to help companies like Shell and BHP import ships that are made in Holland, but it will not find $9 million to back Australian companies exporting ships built here. How stupid is that? That is your decision, and you wonder why the industry is protesting. You wonder why people are up in arms about your policy. It is perverse, even more so when you consider the regional impact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The innovative, export oriented, fast ship and ferry industry, which the bounty has spawned, is based in regional centres such as Fremantle, Hobart, Adelaide, Darwin. The impact on these regions of abolishing the bounty will be disastrous. For example, Austal Ships Pty Ltd, which is based in Fremantle, told the Senate last week when it was looking at this bill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have lost the opportunity with Stena Line (a major European operator) for two vessels and an option for two more with a total value of around $225 million. Stena advises our vessels are now too expensive and they will proceed with the purchase in Europe.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>Great decision, Minister! Some balance sheet: $225 million lost to the nation by one company alone, in return for $9 million to the budget bottom line. This is a group of people who, in trying to convince you to reverse this crazy decision, came all the way from Perth to explain their position. As I understand it, you kept them waiting for up to an hour and a half and then gave them only 10 minutes. Is this the way you are going to continue to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6803"> deal with manufacturers in this country? Is this the way you are going to encourage innovation and export and job growth? Is this the vision that you are going to give manufacturers? You are dismissive of them. You will not listen to their complaints and, in the process, we see jobs going overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Will the Peter Nixon review, which is looking into Tasmania's industry and which the Prime Minister announced with great fanfare at the Liberal Party Federal Council recently, be allowed to address the assessment of Incat, the catamaran producer down there, the largest private sector employer in Tasmania? I quote again from their response to the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Australian government does not appear to support a shipbuilding industry we may consider relocating overseas.</PARA>
<PARA>And what would that mean for the 1,000 employees the company has on its payroll?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where have the government members from Western Australia, Tasmania, South Australia and the Northern Territory been in standing up for their local industries in taking these issues on in their party room? Even Richard Court, the Premier of Western Australia, can see the importance of the ships bounty to Western Australian shipbuilders because he has written to the Prime Minister asking for it to be retained. But none of this means anything to the government. It has axed the bounty in pursuit of the budget bottom line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I go now to the question of books and the publishing industry, which has also lost its bounty. In that industry, an atmosphere of certainty is required for long&hyphen;term investment. That is because the industry operates on the basis of contracts of up to five years. Printing and publishing companies were operating on the clear understanding that the bounty would continue until the end of 1997. In fact, contracts were entered into on that basis. Ending the bounty nearly 18 months early is a retrospective move. The government has compromised the ability of firms in the industry to make sensible investment decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, the bounty's termination ignores what our overseas competitors are doing. New Zealand gives a grant of up to 50 per cent on production costs for certain books&mdash;you <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> know, the country that they want to compare us with when it suits them. Singapore provides tax breaks and other tax incentives for its local printing industry. The reality is that the playing field is not level. These countries are not dismantling their protection measures, yet Australian printers and publishers are expected to compete without assistance. And this, despite the Industry Commission recommending that the bounty remain until the end of 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a government that receives reports and ignores them. Printing and publishing industry bodies estimate that around half of the 2,600 jobs in the industry may be lost: another net reduction in your jobs target, Minister, I might remind you. Griffin Press in Adelaide only last week laid off 140 workers because the bounty has gone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The impact will also be hardest felt in regional Australia. For instance, in Maryborough in Victoria, 25 per cent of the work force is reliant on local printing companies McPhersons and APG. They are already losing export orders to overseas competitors. I visited these companies to see how they will be affected. The minister hasn't; he is too busy playing the share market. Where are the government members from Bendigo, Ballarat and Adelaide during all of these decisions? Deafening silence on their part. Again, the government has simply cut, regardless of the consequences. In this case, the consequences are printing industry employees and their families in Adelaide, Maryborough and other parts of regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the computer bounty, the coalition went to the election promising to match Labor's retention of the bounty to the end of 2000. But in one of their more cynical moves, they have now decided to end it from mid&hyphen;1997. The computer bounty along with other measures of the Labor government&mdash;such as partnerships for development, the research and development tax concession, the export market development grants scheme&mdash;all assisted in the growth of Australia's high&hyphen;tech information industries. All of these programs are now either axed or so cut back that they are insignificant to them.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6804">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Exporters of computer hardware have increased, as a result of Labor's strategy, nine times in the last 10 years. That is what happens if you give sensible industry assistance. Total industry exports, including hardware, componentry and printed circuit boards, have trebled in the last five years. So these payments by government are not subsidies. They are investments in our future industries, and in those industries which are going to provide meaningful and attractive job opportunities to Australians, in particular young Australians. They do represent a return to the nation. They should not be seen as costs. They should be seen as investments in our future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The combined effect of scrapping the bounty and the DIFF scheme and budget cuts to the R&amp;D tax concession, to AusIndustry and to the EMDG will be devastating for Australian industry, many of them small and medium enterprises. AEEMA estimate up to 1,000 jobs will be lost in printed circuit board manufacturing, including 150 at Ericsson in Melbourne, which may close and move overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also the regional effect. IBM is now reconsidering the future of its plant in Wangaratta in Victoria. That plant employs over 600 people and produces $500 million in export and domestic product. Where is the member for Indi (Mr Lieberman) demanding that the Prime Minister apply his jobs test to this decision?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government established an information industries task force to look at industry development and assistance issues, but it is not due to report until April 1997. The bounty continues to the end of June. In the meantime the industry is beset by uncertainty, unable to make investment decisions, yet the information industries are the fastest growing in Australia. They are worth $32 billion in annual production.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn finally to the machine tools and robots bounty, which has also been axed. This has been a critical factor in the development of manufacturing companies such as ANCA in Melbourne, which in five years has grown from 50 to 300 employees, exporting over 90 per cent of its product to the US, Europe and Asia; Farley Cutting Systems, which provides <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> machine tools to the fast catamaran and ferry industries so the axing of this bounty comes as a second blow for them; and Laser Lab, which is in my electorate, whose parent company told the Senate committee that it is considering moving offshore, taking its technology and 50 Australian jobs with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a fantastic manufacturing strategy, Minister! I have not found one decision that is going to add any jobs. How are you going to achieve your 200,000 jobs target when all of the decisions that have been taken in the first budget&mdash;which you would not stand up for the manufacturing industry in&mdash;have seen only job cuts?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bounty has seen Australia's production of bountiable machine tools increase over the last three years by $50 million and exports have more than doubled. Yet again we have the government ignoring an Industry Commission recommendation that the bounty remain in place until the end of 1997. Not only is there no logic in these decisions but also there is no backing for them. The government has taken them because Treasury has won and because the minister is weak and will not stand up for the manufacturing sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's handling of this matter has been disgraceful. It is not just I who says that; industry is also saying that. Asked how they would describe the government's handling of the abolition of the bounties, these were some of the responses. The Australian Information Industry Association said it was `abysmal'. Mimosa Publications said, `It demonstrates a total lack of awareness of the need for a predictable environment. It is extremely short&hyphen;sighted . . . lack of consideration of the impact on employment and the balance of payments.'</PARA>

Despite the subsidies, the payouts, the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6806"> unbalanced budgets and all of the other paraphernalia of the Australian Labor Party's administration, their policies are a notorious failure. We are a declining influence, under their policies, in Asia&mdash;the fastest growing market for Australian manufacturers anywhere in the world. In fact, we were so successful under the policies of the Labor Party that our share of the Asian market in manufactured goods actually declined. It fell by almost 50 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In spite of growing opportunities in the world market, Labor has failed to improve international perceptions of our investment climate. The recent Bureau of Industry Economics survey has shown that the majority of business executives in Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States do not consider themselves well informed about Australia's business environment and had negative perceptions of Australian macro&hyphen;economic policy performance and the government's attitude to foreign investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the sort of climate the Labor Party created nationally and internationally, and they are trying to have this government follow the same policies that proved to be such a failure. It is like a household which is heavily mortgaged, with their furniture on hire purchase, and somebody claims that they should buy a new car and go further into debt in order to get to work faster. That sort of economic folly is something that the Labor Party has to move away from if they are going to gain any credibility with the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would remind the House that the policies of the Australian Labor Party in manufacturing industries and across the board have created record increases in taxation. They have produced record unemployment and record overseas debt at a time when the world economy was booming and at the very time when reasonable or moderate policies would have produced much better results for the Australian people and the Australian manufacturing industries. All of those policies proved a failure. It is no good pointing to one or two instances of sprinkling money out through a bounty process and saying that has been successful. If the nation is going broke and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> unemployment is skyrocketing, you cannot point back to that historic so&hyphen;called benefit and say, `If continued, ultimately it will succeed.' That is just a failure syndrome that the Australian Labor Party has to move away from.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1983, there was a $7.7 billion manufacturing trade deficit. That blew out to $27.5 billion in 1995. That is how well the Labor Party is going with some of these policies of bounties and subsidies. They have not got the basics right in the Australian economy, they have not got the challenge there for people to expect that they are going to make profits and to expand their businesses. The raw figures show that from 1983 through to 1995 there was a quadrupling of the manufacturing deficit in trade. So you cannot claim that you were succeeding if that is what the results of your policies were. You cannot claim that the nation needs to go back to those failed policies in order to succeed. They have been demonstrated to be a failure. Imports now account for 35 per cent of the sales of manufactured goods, and that is up from 24 per cent in the early 1980s. So in fact you worsened our current account deficit. That is what your policy has done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has been in office for a short eight months; you had 13 years to make changes. The historic effort of those 13 years of work has proved to be a failure. We are importing more; we are exporting less; the share of the market has decreased; we had massive unemployment; we have a huge foreign debt. And the former minister Crean, leader of the union movement, comes in here saying that we ought to continue the policies of the Australian Labor Party. How stupid. Why would anybody want to do that? A demonstrated failure repeated over and over and over again. It seems wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He started quoting people who have been affected by the removal of this bounty. No sensible government would want to remove a benefit and damage people's businesses. We have tried to make an interim arrangement for the industry so that the pain is lessened. But no government in its right mind would take these decisions if it did not think there was a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6807"> long&hyphen;term benefit for the Australian people and the Australian manufacturing industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer the shadow minister and the House to some of the evidence given before the Senate committee. One of the firms that he quoted was Mimosa Publications. After exploring all of the bounty issue, Ms Donovan, who was giving evidence on behalf of that firm, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think the disadvantage is not so much tariffs, or the advantageous bounties, it is more the tyranny of distance. Our freight costs of getting materials to markets are high. The time difference is also a problem. If you are shipping books to America, you are looking at a minimum of six weeks. I think that the distance hurts us more.</PARA>
<PARA>And Senator Murray said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More than the price?</PARA>
<PARA>And Ms Donovan said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Plus all the holiday pay, sick pay and those sorts of things. But certainly, in terms of competing with Americans, the distance that we have to ship goods is really a major hurdle.</PARA>
<PARA>Small business and business at large are saying, `These assistance programs are part of it, but they are a minor part,' and Ms Donovan from Mimosa Publications, affected by the bounty decision, is saying that it is all the industrial relations claptrap that we have to put up with; it is all the red tape we must deal with; it is the taxes and the lead in the saddlebags that is far more significant to us than any small advantage that we may receive from a bounty scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So that is why the government has made the decision: it wants to get the basics of the Australian economy right; it wants to get people aware that there are $9 billion or $10 billion worth of outgoings each budget just to keep level with the repayments on our huge foreign debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our outgoings in the budget up until now have been about equivalent to our total payment for education or defence just to repay the debt that the Australian Labor Party has run up. And they want to continue these policies for an indefinite period and say that, ultimately, Australia will succeed when the policies have been proven, time and again, to be a failure. That is not the real world and the Australian people do not believe that.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister made such a disappointing speech when he was in the House; a speech which showed that he had not learned anything new. He had no new proposals; he had some rhetoric about this as `what if' and `maybe' sort of stuff. It was just a continuation of what we have heard in the past. If he is going to make a real contribution in this parliament, and I know that it is his fierce ambition to make a very significant contribution in this parliament, then the shadow minister will need to come back to some real innovation in his thinking and move away from those failed policies of the past, because regurgitating that stuff will not convince anybody.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ultimately, it will not convince the Mimosa presses or the Ms Donovans or the Bert Evans or anybody else because they know the real problems of this nation are substantially more than whether or not they receive a bounty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian government has made this decision. I would like to run through, for the benefit of the House, the various areas where the computer bounty, the books bounty, the machine tools and robots bounty and the shipbuilding bounty have been changed because it is not as gross as presented by the shadow minister. It is not as difficult as presented by some of the firms that appeared before the Senate committee. It is a change, but change was in the wind and it had been flagged by both the previous government and the Industry Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Industry Commission reviewed the computer industry and reported in June 1995, a little over a year ago. The Industry Commission recommend the bounty be allowed to expire in December 1995. It recommended that the bounty be allowed to run for a few months further. According to the Industry Commission, its recommendation to the government was that the bounty be allowed to expire at the end of last year. However, the then government subsequently introduced legislation to extend the bounty to the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition of the day agreed with that and, regrettably, we included a continuation of that bounty in our policy. However, we have changed our policy in regard to bounties. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6808"> Nobody likes doing that to the bounty in regard to computers. It is a shame that that has had to occur but one must look at the total picture and the total goals of the government. This government, on finding it had responsibility for a $10 billion black hole in the budget that it was not expecting to find&mdash;although it was prepared to accept the responsibility and fix it&mdash;had to make some hard decisions, and it did make some hard decisions. Unfortunately, the computer bounty has to be terminated and the budget will terminate it on 30 June 1997. It has a few more months to run. It runs, I would point out to the House, far beyond the recommendation of the Industry Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for the books bounty, the draft Industry Commission report released in August this year recommended that the bounty be allowed to lapse when the current scheme terminates in December 1997. However the book bounty is to be ended about one year prior to that recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the machine tools and robots bounty, the draft Industry Commission report recommends the scheme be allowed to lapse when the current scheme terminates on 30 June 1997. The budget terminates that bounty in August 1996, a year early.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for the shipbuilding bounty, the Bureau of Industry Economics reviewed the bounty in early 1995. The Bureau of Industry Economics concluded the Australian shipbuilding industry had matured and no longer required direct support. The bounty was due to be terminated on 30 June 1997 but this legislation will terminate the bounty on 20 August 1996. There is a shortening of the term of the bounty. It would be impossible to say that is not the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, when one looks at all the reports and the previous government's attitude towards the payment of bounties, one would have to say that the writing was on the wall. The writing was on the wall for these industries and they should have been making some sort of changes. If they were not making some sort of plans to take into account that there was going to be a termination of the bounties then that would have been most <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> foolish. It would have been dreadfully short&hyphen;sighted management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bounties were never considered to be an infinite source of assistance. The former government industry minister, Alan Griffiths, said on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> in April 1993 in response to a question about the continuation of government assistance to industry:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there'll be opportunities for government to assist, to offer assistance during that nurturing phase, but of course, taking the shipbuilding example, government involvement there will be temporary.</PARA>
<PARA>That was a warning issued by a previous minister in the Labor government three years ago. The shipbuilding industry was aware of that government's intention to terminate the bounty process. It is no good coming in here crying crocodile tears that it should have continued because the industry was on notice. It knew that this was a temporary arrangement and it should have been aware of that and been making plans, and I believe that many in the industry were doing so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Liberal government has taken additional measures to ensure that Australian industries are prepared for the challenges ahead. In relation to shipbuilding and books, there are generous transitional arrangements. In the case of computers the government has convened the Information Industries Taskforce to consider whether and in what form assistance might be required in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That task force has been established. I have reams of press releases from the minister about it, what it is going to do, what its terms of reference are and everything else. Yet there was not a word from the previous speaker about whether that task force had appropriate terms of reference or whether it would meet the objectives of the industry. The member for Hotham just gave that the flick and said, `That doesn't count at all.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unlike Labor, this government does not advocate unproductive handouts to industry. The government is committed to providing meaningful policy support and assistance to Australian industry. Our commitment is real because we know where the problems are. We know that the policies of the previous government failed time and time again. Under the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6809"> Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser), a report has been released regarding the deregulation of small businesses and business at large to see how they can be assisted by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Business people made a number of claims. They wanted fringe benefits tax to be cleaned up and something to be done with that. They wanted red tape to be changed. They wanted the reform agenda to be pushed ahead by this government. This group, which was established by the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs and which reported to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), was looking at the deregulation of business. It reported that business people would prefer to have an optional pay&hyphen;as&hyphen;you&hyphen;go voluntary payment system of taxation. They wanted easier ways to handle paperwork.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They provided a series of very solid and practical recommendations concerning the conduct of the Australian Taxation Office. They commented on sales tax, the Income Tax Assessment Act and how it worked, and payroll tax. They also had a lot of things to say about industrial relations and employment issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These issues have even been mentioned in the Senate Economics Legislation Committee in the last few days by people who are claimed by the Australian Labor Party to be most strongly opposed to the removal of the bounty. Those people have said to the committee, `The real issues are not bounties.' These are the issues identified by the Small Business Deregulation Task Force. These are the matters that are of significance to Australian businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party comes in here crying crocodile tears about what should or should not happen. I would like to remind the House that the Keating government spent $165 million on the new Department of Foreign Affairs building down the road. Businesses in Australia are really happy that public servants in the elite Department of Foreign Affairs are better housed than they were previously. Some $394,000 was spent on a fountain there. Some $88 million was spent on housing for surplus staff in Canberra and $994,000 was <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> spent on a ladder to get into buildings occupied by terrorists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a list of examples as long as your arm. Millions and millions of dollars have been wasted, including the subsidies paid to musicians in the union movement so the Labor Party could claim a donation from those same unions coming into the election campaign. What a dreadful way to use taxpayers' money. Then the Labor Party people come in here crying crocodile tears and saying, `It's a pity you cut this bounty off.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has greater priorities than this. This government is prepared to make the hard decisions. The minister at the table knows industry. He is gifted with vision for and understanding of Australia's manufacturing industry. He is applauded in every factory into which he goes, both by the workers and the management. I know that he will lead the manufacturing industry out of the morass of failure in which the Australian Labor Party left it when Labor was forced from office on 2 March 1996.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is indeed a privilege to follow one of the only two speakers that the government has been able to organise to support the legislation that is before the House, the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill 1996. If you look at the speakers list, you will see that there is quite a substantial number of opposition speakers and, after the minister, only two speakers on the government side.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to speak only with reference to the amendment to the Bounty (Ships) Act, which is part of this compendium legislation with respect to a variety of bounties. This particular amendment specifies that the ships bounty, which commenced at 15 per cent of the value of the vessel from 1989&hyphen;90 and on a sliding scale is due to reach five per cent for the 1997&hyphen;98 year and conclude with that year, will be cut short, with the result that $3.2 million will be saved in the 1996&hyphen;97 financial year and $6.2 million in the 1997&hyphen;98 financial year. That is approximately $9.4 million in savings. As a consequence of this bill being passed, if it is passed by this House and by the Senate, the assistance that has been <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6810"> provided by the government of this country to the shipbuilding industry since the late 1980s, rather than tapering down, as it was originally intended to do, is going to be peremptorily removed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the previous decade we have seen in Australia a virtually new industry emerge in the area of shipbuilding. The Australian shipbuilding industry had been in a significant state of decline for various reasons over preceding decades, but since the mid&hyphen;1980s we have seen an extraordinarily vibrant new industry emerge, very much related to the previous shipbuilding industry but, I think, entitled to be considered a new industry in its own right. The bounty that has been provided by the previous government that this government proposes to eliminate has been a critical factor in the development of this industry. It is very important to recall that the industries with which the Australian shipbuilding industry is competing internationally are almost universally subsidised by governments, particularly in Europe, and in most cases subsidised to a far greater extent that they have been subsidised in Australia. So they are not competing on a level playing field; the playing field is already grossly tilted against them in most cases. In some instances, the subsidies can be as high as effectively 50 per cent of the value of the vessel, and certainly nine to 12 per cent is a very common figure. So a subsidy of five per cent, which is what we are arguing about today, still remains a significant subsidy but it is less than that which most of the competitors to the Australian manufacturers are able to avail themselves of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This industry now has roughly 3,000 employees directly employed in shipyards that are largely situated in Western Australia, Tasmania and South Australia. There are also smaller yards in one or two other states but it is notable that it is a regionally dominated industry. It is really not particularly strong in Victoria and New South Wales, the traditional manufacturing and heavy industry states. It is very much a new industry that has been built up in states that historically have not been powerful manufacturing states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well as those 3,000 employees, there are a further approximately 10,000 employees in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> related industries, in industries that supply all sorts of component services and assistance to the fast ferry manufacturing industry. Those are things like components, seating for vessels, software and a whole range of things that are provided by these related industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To date, about $195 million has been paid in the bounty. If you compare that with what has been invested in research and development, in capital investment and in training by the companies which have received the bounty over that period, there has been $167 million worth of investment by those companies in those vital components of competitiveness over that period. In 1995&hyphen;96, the exports from this part of the industry, from the shipbuilding industry in Australia, totalled $430 million. Of that, roughly $260 million came from the fast ferry sector. That is a very important export performance and is in an area where traditionally Australia's exports have been very limited indeed. Had this bounty been retained, it would be reasonable to expect that Australia would have been heading towards the half billion dollar mark with respect to exports very shortly, and also reasonable to expect that in the longer term the exports would hit the $1 billion mark.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has a very long boat and shipbuilding history. In 1810, the manufacture of ships was the number one manufacturing industry in the colony of New South Wales. From 1828 to 1838, in Tasmania, roughly 10 vessels per year were manufactured, averaging a weight of 130 tonnes. So there is a long history and a long tradition of building ships and boats in Australia. Yet, 10 years ago, this industry was virtually threatened with extinction, primarily because of changes in world market conditions, but particularly because of state&hyphen;subsidised competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the mid&hyphen;1980s, almost out of nowhere and with very limited assistance from government, we have seen the fast ferry manufacturing industry in this country become, literally, world leaders. Australia is the world leader in the manufacture of aluminium ferries; is earning those export dollars I indicated; and is leading the world in technological development and in satisfying customer demand. Australian ferries are now plying routes all <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6811"> around the world, and demand is increasing. It is something that is not widely understood and it is something that this government really ought to recognise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The leaders in this industry have been firms such as Austral, Oceanfast, Incat, SA Ships&mdash;all, as I have indicated, in regional Australia. They all provide important employment&mdash;highly skilled and highly paid jobs to not only the people working for them, but also for people working in related industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This industry is significantly different from its predecessor: the types of vessels it is constructing are different; the materials and the technologies that are being used are different; the firms and their structure and their origins are different; the work force, the nature of the skills and the infrastructure which supports them are different; and the locations, particularly, where the ships are being built and where the economic activity is occurring, are also different.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Between 1987&hyphen;88 and 1993&hyphen;94, average Australian economic growth was 2.5 per cent. Of the eight maritime sectors recognised by the Bureau of Industry Economics, six of them grew by at least three times that rate: in other words, at least 7.5 per cent. Exports from the sector grew by 10.6 per cent, whereas overall exports grew by seven per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the three years 1988 to 1990, the export&hyphen;import ratio in the shipbuilding industry was 0.59. In other words, there was a deficit. From 1991 to 1993 the ratio improved to 0.88 and from 1994 to 1996 it improved to 1.6. What had previously been a $39 million deficit in the period 1991 to 1993 has, in the period 1994 to 1996, become a $137 million trade surplus in shipbuilding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The industry's regional presence is of fundamental importance to economies like Tasmania and Western Australia. It is of vital importance in Western Australia in diversifying the economic base, which, strong as it is, has historically been vulnerable to fluctuations in commodity prices. It is vitally important in places like Tasmania and South Australia, which have suffered some economic decline because of structural international economic change. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Between 1985 and 1992, shipbuilding jobs fell by roughly half in Australia, to 5,600. But, as a result of the work of the fast ferry industry and the people in that industry, that statistic has now turned around and jobs are increasing. The jobs tend to be highly skilled and well paid, and there are many small businesses, such as Beurteax Australia, a manufacturer of seats, and software businesses, that are thriving as a result of the demand from the manufacture of these vessels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The industry has succeeded because it has a skilled work force, because of the vision and the courage of the leaders in the industry, and because of the genuine entrepreneurship of the people who have pioneered the industry. It has succeeded because of a sophisticated domestic demand that has emerged from the manufacturing of commercial fishing vessels, recreational vessels, and offshore oil and gas vessels and the like. Government assistance, relatively limited though it has been, has been targeted and intelligent and it has enabled these firms to grow from the bottom up. The key form of government assistance has been the bounty. There have been other forms of assistance, such as assistance with training and provisions of skills, but the key form of assistance has been this bounty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further growth in this industry is quite realistically anticipated. There are many countries in Asia which are, essentially, water based countries: large island countries such as Indonesia and the Philippines, where the long&hyphen;term prospects for the demand for fast ferries are considerable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now dominate the world in this industry, and the great tragedy of this legislation will be that, just as we have achieved this position, our competitors, particularly those in Europe who are heavily subsidised, will be given an open look&hyphen;in to resume their previous position. So, just as the Australian industry is establishing itself and has created a dominant position and is leading the world, the government is now going to pull the rug out from underneath its feet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bounty will be abolished over the period when it would have been phased out, saving roughly $9&half; million. There has been <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6812"> virtually no consultation with the industry at all. Some extraordinary statements were being made by the minister at the table and by the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) previously about how everybody in the industry supported all these initiatives, but that wasn't the case when I was down visiting shipyards and talking to the leading figures in this industry only on Monday. Exactly the opposite message was being conveyed. Also, in a broader and more indirect sense, these sorts of industries are going to suffer as a result of the reduction in tax deductibility for research and development, as a result of the slashing of labour market programs, which are of great importance to them in ensuring that they have got access to skilled workers, and as a result of a whole range of other industry assistance disappearing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor government, for example, provided targeted assistance such as nearly half a million dollars through the national skills shortages program to the College of Aluminium Training and others, which was of considerable importance to this industry in ensuring that highly skilled, sophisticated work forces could be developed to deal with the very complex and technical tasks involved with manufacturing fast ferries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's response to the concerns of the industry has been not to talk with them, not to consult, not to rethink&mdash;it has been to rub their noses in it. It has virtually refused to talk to this industry. It is an absolutely extraordinary fact that when the Liberal Federal Council was on in Hobart recently, nobody&mdash;not the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), who was invited, not anybody on his behalf&mdash;was prepared to go to Incat and talk to Bob Clifford, who employs a thousand Tasmanians in that industry and is responsible for significant additional employment of others in flow&hyphen;on areas. Nobody was prepared to go and talk to him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the leaders of the Western Australian industry, John Farrell and John Rothwell, wanted to talk to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore), they got an appointment out of him over here. They had to fly over from Perth, spending a few thousand dollars on air fares. The minister turned <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> up an hour and a half late and he walked in and said, `Look, sorry, folks, I am very busy, I can only give you 10 minutes.' That is nothing less than an insult. That is rubbing the noses of the industry in the decision that the government has taken without any consultation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To cap it all off, the government was notable for its absence at the landmark Ausmarine conference that I had the privilege of opening in Perth on Monday of this week. But we do see some presence from the government. They are not totally out of the picture, because at that conference we had a very nice book distributed called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia and the Sea</EMPHASIS>, by Baird Publications. Lo and behold, what do we have in the foreword but a nice picture of the minister&mdash;a lovely, smiling picture of the minister saying how important the maritime industries were and how the government is fully behind them, doing everything it can to help; all of the usual platitudes. Everything but assistance and everything but consultation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, while they are there actually ripping away the supports, ripping away the assistance that has been vital to this industry developing as the world leader, ripping away all of this support base and assistance, and refusing to effectively consult the industry, refusing to reconsider their decision, refusing even to look at the impact that this decision is going to have, they are still there saying, `Don't worry, we're behind you.' The glossy photos are still there. The platitudes in the introduction to the conference book are still there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that the government does not understand that manufacturing industry in this country has changed dramatically. It still has a 1970s view. It still has a Fraser government view&mdash;and that is hardly surprising when you consider that the industry minister is a refugee from the Fraser government. Within months of this government taking office, you have had the Heavy Engineering Manufacturing Association and other associated bodies vitriolically criticising the government for a lack of vision in the industry area and for its bias in favour of agricultural and commodity industries. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6813">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government does not understand the new industry policy framework that was built in the latter part of the period of the previous government. It does not understand the notions of enhancing competitiveness factors like research and development and skills and management and technological change and export market development. It simply does not understand the significance of these things, which have been going on overseas in Europe, the US and Asia for decades and which Australia was finally starting to get into&mdash;belatedly, but nonetheless was still getting into. Now we have got a government that simply wants to go back to the 1970s, and maybe even worse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Its only sense of what constitutes assistance and intervention is the old-style McEwen intervention of jack up the tariffs. As far as this government is concerned, that is its sole picture of what industry assistance consists of. It really does not understand that things in this country have moved a long way on from that sort of assistance to much more intelligent and sophisticated and targeted assistance that has been of great benefit to the emerging new manufacturing industries such as the fast ferry building industry that we are now seeing developed in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They do not understand some of the theoretical developments that have occurred in industry policy. Let us ask the minister what he knows about new growth theory, for example, or strategic trade theory or the landmark works of Michael Porter and the influence that they have had on industry policy throughout the world. There is a range of modifications to the neoclassical economic theories that all of these new developments bring. Certainly, they should influence how we see our industry assistance strategy. The current government is obviously unaware that any of this has occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, the government does not understand this new industry, this new aluminium fast ferry building industry. It does not understand the critical role that government assistance has played up till now. It does not understand the enormous amount of government assistance that our competitors receive in places like Europe. It does not <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> understand the enormous strides that have been made by the shipbuilders, the great innovation, the great genuine entrepreneurialism that has occurred in this industry, and particularly it does not understand that we have world leaders on our hands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How many times has Australia been able to claim in an area of manufacturing that we lead the world, particularly in an area that involves building such large, such expensive and such important products as these vessels? How many times have we been able to say that? We should be proud of this industry. We should be trumpeting our success to the world and we should be giving it every form of assistance that we can.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Senate committee hearings on 1 November, John Rothwell&mdash;and this is an interesting contrast to what the member for Mitchell said about what the leaders of the industry were saying&mdash;said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The present government has shown very little interest in what the industry is doing.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is pretty much an understatement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not about picking winners, it is about backing winners, winners who, with a very limited amount of government assistance, have achieved enormous things for this country, for employment and for economic development in regions. It is about backing them. Instead of continuing the modest, the strategically targeted, assistance that the former government put in place, this government is now treating this very important growing industry with contempt. It should restore the bounty and urgently enter into proper consultations and discussions with this industry to consider how government at all levels can assist it to continue to grow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not pretend that as a result of these decisions this industry is going to collapse because it is too strong for that, it is too well developed now and it is doing too well to collapse. But what this decision will mean is that this industry will be put in a vulnerable position, as against its competitors in Europe, at a critical time. Just when it has established its dominance, just when it is going ahead in leaps and bounds, all of a sudden it is going to be brought back to the pack.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6814">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opportunity that we are giving voluntarily to our competitors in Europe will be acted upon. It will be taken up and our industry as a result will stagnate for a period of time and will suffer. It may lose its dominant position and once it loses that position it is very hard to get it back again. It is a crucial time in the development of this industry and it is an absolutely extraordinary decision to withdraw an amount of money which totals less than $10 million over two years. To withdraw that at this time is an act of economic vandalism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In an industry where innovation is critical, where you have very demanding customers, where literally every vessel that is produced has to be an improvement on the previous vessel, where there are low profit margins&mdash;there are not huge amounts of money being made out of this&mdash;every effort has to be made to sell the next boat. You do not have customers coming to you saying, `I want 10 vessels over the next five years' or anything like that. Sales are done on an individual basis. This is a tough industry, this is a difficult industry, and we as Australians should be proud of the fact that our manufacturers from a very limited base have been able to go out and achieve what they have achieved in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead of the pride, instead of the support, instead of the consultation and discussion and interaction that the industry got from the former government, what it is now getting is not only the withdrawal of the bounty but it is being literally ignored by this government; it is being treated as if it did not exist. Believe me, that is how the leaders of this industry feel. They feel that they have been treated with contempt by this government and that this government simply does not understand what has been occurring in the industry. It has got no concept of what manufacturing industry is doing in Australia in the 1990s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge the House to support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean) and to reject the bill and to support the retention of this bounty in particular and the other&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr MILES</EMPHASIS> (Braddon&mdash;Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> (1.40 p.m.)&mdash;I rise to support the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill 1996. The member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) said that the rug had been pulled out from under the feet of some of these industries, that we were ripping away assistance, and that we did not understand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately for the Australian economy, the rug was ripped out from under everybody's feet prior to the last election. I will illustrate that by saying that the record which we inherited from the previous government absolutely demanded that there be a new course, a new direction adopted by this government. I have no doubt that that is why the Australian people voted overwhelmingly, right throughout Australia, in every state and territory of this country, for the coalition. There was a tremendous amount of support for a change of government. It was because the Australian people had the rug pulled out from under their feet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Melbourne referred to the shipbuilding industry in Australia. He said it had had the rug pulled out from under its feet. We are asking the shipping industry in Australia to contribute about $9.4 million to this huge debt which we have inherited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, there was some inconsistency in what the member for Melbourne was saying. He said that this is a vibrant, strong, and dynamic industry. Knowing the Incat industry in Tasmania, I can say that it is a dynamic industry. It has taken a lot of hard work; there is no doubt about that. However, when a country is left with a chaotic set of accounts, the incoming government has a responsibility to do something about it&mdash;not to ignore it, not to walk away from it, but to actually address the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will say, over and over again, that this government did not create that $10 billion debt in the current account, but we are taking responsibility for doing something about it. We will address the problem. In the past there was no plan. The previous speaker said that governments ought to pick winners. That is the way in which governments probably operated throughout the 1960s and the 1970s, but I am absolutely amazed that somebody could come into a parliament in a Western <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6815"> country today and suggest that governments ought to be out there picking out which industries are going to be the winners. That is farcical.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are here as parliamentary legislators, and to suggest that we would have better information than the actual market to determine who the winners are is really quite fanciful. That is something from a bygone era. It is very clear that, instead of moving on towards a new set of perspectives on the economy, instead of looking towards the year 2000 and onward, the economic approach of the members of the opposition is actually drifting back into the 1960s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that the opposition is struggling to find any policy position right across the front here in the different portfolio areas. This has been illustrated in this debate. Both the previous speaker and the shadow minister for industry and regional development talked about policies that have led to failure in this country. I would now like to go through some of the circumstances which those previous policies on industry and the underpinning of the economy led to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those policies led to the worst economic downturn in 60 years. These are the policies which the shadow minister wants us to go back to. He would like us to go into another recession, probably the worst in 70 years. Home mortgage rates&mdash;these are fairly relevant&mdash;hit 17 per cent under the previous administration, and yet only yesterday we saw mortgage rates drop by another 0.5 per cent, to under nine per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government's record was when it was at 17 per cent. Business loans were over 20 per cent. Business loans are down to somewhere about 11 per cent now. They say they want us to go back to their policies&mdash;they want us to keep providing all this money, like bounties, to businesses. It was those sorts of policies which actually led business to have to pay 20 per cent in interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has had the capacity to pull down interest rates because of our policy. We have taken a tough position. We do not deny that, and we know that there are many Australian people and families and businesses <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> who find some of these things difficult. But they would not have been difficult if the previous management had looked after the books instead of racking up a debt on the bankcard. Then, when it was all out of control, the Australian people said, `Well, we've got to bring in a new government to try and sort out this mess,' and that is exactly what happened. But today we are seeing a debate where the opposition, the Labor Party, want to take us back to policy positions which would give us these huge interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have not done any calculations, but I suspect very strongly that the drop in interest rates from the high which we saw under the Labor Party of 20 per cent to between 10 per cent and 12 per cent for business now is of far greater magnitude and benefit to all these businesses from which some of these bounties have been taken than the bounties. I suspect that that is true, if we were to go and do those calculations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are some of the other situations which previous policies led to? Household debt rose over $200 million, equivalent to nearly 70 per cent of household disposable income. We also noticed that the current account reached $27 billion in May 1995. About 15 months ago, this country experienced the worst current account ever: $2.7 billion in one month, and for that year it was $27 billion. It is incredible that a country so rich in resources could be so badly mismanaged that we would end up with a $2.7 billion current account deficit for that month, and yet the opposition here want us to go back to those policies, to go back to them to create greater debt. This government is not in the position of handing on to our children and future generations a debt incurred because we liked to live it up in our time and which our children and our grandchildren are going to have to pay off in the future. We are about doing something about it and we intend to make sure that we make a dent in and reduce debt in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last point in regard to illustrating how the rug was pulled out from underneath the feet of the Australian economy is to say that foreign debt over the last 13 years under the Labor government went from $23 billion to $185 billion. I notice there are a few people <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6816"> in the gallery at the moment and I know this is going out on radio. It is very interesting to ponder on the thought that the previous administration, under their industry policy and all the rest of it, increased our debt by $162 billion in 13 years. Those figures are beyond what any of us can actually imagine. For the first 83 years in this country our overseas debt went up by $23 billion. Then we had Labor&mdash;the previous administration in power here: in their 13 years it went up by $162 billion. That really does underscore the huge problem that we are faced with. Not only that, but a lot of that was Commonwealth debt.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad the member interjects. When Mr Keating became Prime Minister the debt figure for the Commonwealth was about $33 billion. However, 4&half; years later it was $99 billion because he went and borrowed from overseas banks.

That is an outrageous situation and it is the young people who are sitting in the gallery who are going to have to try to pay that off as they grow up and go into the work force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is those circumstances which we are annoyed about as a government. There is one thing about it: the policy that we have brought in which affects the bounty schemes is one way in which we can go about reining in this horrendous debt, this mismanagement that occurred under the Keating and Hawke Labor governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To make a few points about the bounty schemes themselves, the bounty schemes were introduced to assist industries to remain internationally competitive. They are no longer considered to be an appropriate or cost&hyphen;effective means of industry assistance. This is confirmed by the recent Industry Commission report which recommended that bounty schemes be terminated. Bounties are being paid at declining rates of support in line with a general reduction in general tariff levels. The Labor Party would like us to reduce tariff levels in lots of areas in the economy but they do not want us to reduce <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the bounties. What we are saying is that as Australians we have to share the burden equally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe the impact of bounties on industry development is declining in importance. This means that the cost of compliance and administration is unrealistically high. Terminating the bounties will result in a total saving of $8.5 million in this financial year, $14.8 million in 1997-98, $20 million in 1998-99, $46 million in 1999&hyphen;2000 and $31 million in each year thereafter. What we have to remember is that while we are cutting these bounties to some in the business sector, at the same time in this budget we brought in a one billion dollar package of tax relief for families. So by cutting in some of these sectors we are able to provide tax relief to many ordinary Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The industries affected by the withdrawal of the bounties are strong, viable industries. We have heard that even from spokesmen from the opposition. Restructuring and efficiency improvements that have taken place in recent years will enable them to remain internationally competitive. These industries need to share, along with most other manufacturing service sectors of the Australian economy, some of the hurt and some of the load that goes with the government's economic rescue plan. We are sharing it around. It was a tough budget but it was fair, and that has been recognised by everybody throughout the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In regard to the shipbuilding bounty, the Australian shipbuilding industry is one of the best in the world in the construction of small to medium lightweight vessels. The innovative use of materials and designs has had a real impact around the world as conventional ferries are being replaced by fast ferries. The economies created by faster turnarounds have created a bigger market for this type of craft and Australia's share of that market has increased from 25 to 30 per cent in recent years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6817"> Tasmania is justifiably proud of its ship builder, Incat Tasmania Pty Ltd, a business which manufactures and exports high-speed catamarans to various parts of the world. It has become a successful and profitable busi ness. It is a frontier industry in the fabrication of aluminium, in the design of high-speed catamarans and in entrepreneurial marketing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the reasons why Incat is able to be competitive is because of the way in which they organise their industrial relations at that complex, a complex where there is no unionised labour. They are able to organise people so that some of those workers have varied times at which they go to work. Some of them voluntarily opt to work a lot more than the 38 or 40 hours which is average. Why? They do that because they like the business and they get well paid for their work. Obviously, the owner also gets a good product. The business is viable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That underpins another area in which the opposition would have us stay back in the troglodyte era of industrial relations when it is clearly time to move on. Australians voted on 2 March to move on and to change things. Incat is a very good example of how that has been changed to produce a very profitable business. Incat, as with other shipbuilders, has to accept a share of the burden in achieving the nation's economic recovery. The abolition of the ships bounty will save $9.4 million throughout 1997&hyphen;98. The shipbuilding industry in Australia has a positive future and is well able to absorb the measures contained in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill provides for transitional provisions to accommodate shipbuilders who, on the day of the budget, either had ships under construction or had already entered into contracts to be completed by 30 June 1997. It gives the builders an opportunity to change the structure of their tendering or their pricing of ships for anybody who wants to purchase one from them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some people say, `What about shipbuilders who, for various reasons, are unable to complete ships by 30 June 1997?' This is a feature of the existing legislation and has no connection with this bill or the decision announced in the budget. The withdrawal of the bounty for shipbuilding was recommended by the Bureau of Industry Economics in March 1995&mdash;under the previous Labor administration.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was a recognition on the bureau's part that Australia's shipbuilding industry had come of age and that it would be competitive without a bounty being offered. The date which the bureau suggested would be appropriate for the bounty to be withdrawn was 30 June 1997. This is the date on which the current bounty arrangement for shipbuilders is due to expire. It is also effectively the date on which this  legislation phases out the bounty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The withdrawal of the shipbuilding bounty will result in the saving of $3.22 million this financial year and $6 million in 1997&hyphen;98. Compare this with a total turnover in the ship and boat building industry in Australia of nearly $2 billion. Yet the Labor Party complains about taking $3 million off one year and $6 million off another year out of $2 billion. That is $3 million and $6 million out of $2,000 million, and yet members of the opposition are crying and wringing their hands and saying that it is going to destroy the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was the opposition that left Australia with a huge debt of $10 billion. With this debt, the opposition pulled the rug out from under not only industry in Australia, but also from under Australian families. As I was saying earlier, this government certainly did not create this debt, but it will do something about it. We will not make future generations pay the debt which you left to this government. We are doing something about it now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party wanted future Australians to have the bankcard mentality. It wanted to spend money frivolously, and not worry about how to raise the money or the taxes. It has been left for the coalition government to clean up the mess that members of the opposition left. There is no doubt that the position adopted by the government on this measure gives a very clear indication that this government is going to address the problems which we faced when we came into government. We will do something about it&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Given recent reductions in home loan mortgage rates as a result of the government's budget strategy and encouragement of competition in the provision of home mortgages, can the Treasurer advise the House whether there is any scope for fostering further reductions in mortgage rates?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="6820" SPEAKER="Costello, Peter, MP" NAMEID="CT4" ELECTORATE="Higgins" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Treasurer" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Kooyong for his question because, as all of Australia would know now, we have historically low variable mortgage rates in Australia&mdash;and the only people who are upset by that are the Australian Labor Party. The only people who hate low interest rates are the Australian Labor Party. You could not have seen longer faces than those of the Australian Labor Party yesterday as we saw variable mortgage rates tumble, as we saw the opportunity for Australian home buyers to get some breathing space against the high interest rates which Labor had inflicted upon them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen, during the course of this year, standard rates fall from 10.5 per cent to 8.75 per cent. The aggressive competition&hyphen;driven mortgage originators have now offered loans below eight per cent for the first time <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6821"> in 22 years, since 1974&mdash;since the days the fathers of the Creans and the Beazleys used to pad around in the House of Representatives. These are the lowest rates that have been produced since their fathers were padding around in this place in the early 1970s&mdash;and I am sure their sons will be padding around this place in another 22 years too.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government really does believe that competition can deliver increased benefits to home buyers. In 1988 the average spread on domestic major bank interest rates was around five points. It has been 3.8 per cent in the six months to March 1996 and we had the competition induced reduction in June. Competition amongst financial institutions can drive margins lower. This government is committed to policies to keep the heat of competition up for the benefit of consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has announced a financial system inquiry to make recommendations to the government in March of next year so that we can turn the levers up in relation to competition and get better benefits for Australian home buyers. These are the kinds of falls in margins which this government wants to see.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We realise that the climate has never been better for Australian home buyers, but we want to make it better still.

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I said in answer to the Leader of the Opposition, irrespective of what political party you are in, unemployment <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> remains a major social and economic challenge for this country. That remains the situation. The member for Batman knows that if you are really serious about reducing unemployment in Australia you have to do two things. The first thing you have to do is achieve, over a sustained period of time, higher rates of economic growth than the rates we have at the present time which are, by world standards, quite high.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I don't think anybody from the other side should be heard too loudly to argue that the rates of economic growth in Australia at the present time are anything other than quite high, because in reality there is not an enormous difference between what they are at the present time and what they were six or nine months ago. They are quite high. They are very good.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But over a sustained period of time, in order to get unemployment down and keep it down, you need to have even higher rates of economic growth. Part of the way of achieving those higher rates of economic growth is to create the climate where people are induced to take greater investment risks. One of the ways you induce people to make greater investment risks is to reduce interest rates. You should understand that if the cost of borrowing money is reduced people are more likely to borrow. That is exactly the strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have created a budget strategy which has made it easier rather than harder for the Reserve Bank of Australia to reduce interest rates. We are now seeing interest rates coming down. One of the consequences of those reduced interest rates will be higher levels of investment and those higher levels of investment over time will contribute to higher levels of economic growth. That is the first condition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead of criticising that, instead of talking down the Australian economy, if you want to create greater job growth you should be talking up the Australian economy. You profess a concern about the unemployed. You shed crocodile tears about young Australians but out of the corner of your mouth you talk down the Australian economy. I really think you ought to examine your own motives.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6822">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing you have to do if you want to reduce unemployment is remove the structural impediments to job generation. In other words, you ought to support, not oppose, our industrial relations legislation. You ought to admit that your stupid job destroying unfair dismissal law created the problem we are now grappling with, instead of voting to phase-out junior wage rates, as you are doing at the moment in the Senate and thereby threatening 250,000&mdash;a quarter of a million&mdash;jobs of young Australians. You and your leader asked me questions about youth unemployment but in the other place you are voting to threaten the jobs of 250,000 young Australians.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4K4">Mr ANDERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. Why is the Labor Party against that?  They were responsible for a lot of this damage in the first place. It reflects the fact that total farm debt as a result of 13 years of your mismanagement coupled with some other major problems in the bush have left us with a farm debt of about $18 billion. It is a very high level. The government is doing its bit. It does have a long-term commitment and this is reflected in a range of our activities, not least of all micro-economic reform and fiscal consolidation but also things like the drought recovery package&mdash;$81.5 million, bringing the total of new money since we came to government to $170-odd million.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That recognises our commitment to the rural sector. Couple that with things like a business plan for agriculture with landcare and the heritage bill, a reform agenda of far&hyphen;reaching consequences for the beef and wool industries, a visionary five-year approach to wheat marketing in this country and you have clear evidence of the government's commitment to agriculture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is reflected in some comments made by John Cobb of the New South Wales Farmers Association. He said that he welcomed the announcement in relation to drought recovery as a recognition that the pain of a severe drought did not stop just because it rained. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The terrible drought that still lingers in some parts of New South Wales was economically crippling to just about everyone it touched. It takes more than just a few short months of good pasture to recover from such a natural disaster and the Federal Government has understood this.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very welcome commentary. The banks tell me that they are prepared to give a long-term commitment to agriculture when they are encouraged to do so by a government that has a long-term commitment to agriculture. They did not actually see that in the previous regime's management. On the basis of the clear commitment that they now have from government, it is up to them to pass on the full benefits of the interest rate cut and to pass it on quickly and comprehensively. I do encourage them to match the government's commitment. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6823">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With our long-term commitment to the substantial rebuilding of agriculture, we really do seek the maximisation of the interest rate reductions. I want to add to that that any further assistance that could be offered in the area of margins and costs would not only be welcome but also be very much in the interests of a vital part of the Australian economy. I note with some interest too what the NFF's John Watson has said about the cut of 0.5 per cent. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decision represented a commonsense reaction to responsible fiscal policy.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what the NFF said. They also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to this welcome cut in official rates, there is room for further trimming of bank margins, which remain among the highest in the OECD.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure that all members of the House will welcome the visit in a few weeks time of His All Holiness the Ecumenical Patriarch, Bartholomew I. This will be the first occasion that the Orthodox patriarch has visited Australia. There is a nominal grouping of more than one million Australians within the Orthodox rite. It includes a very large portion of Greek Austral <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> ians, Russians and people from the former Yugoslavia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am delighted, on behalf of the government, to extend a welcome to His All Holiness. He will be accorded a guest of government status during his visit. He is the spiritual leader of more than 250 million Orthodox Christians around the world. His visit will be a marvellous opportunity to observe the contribution that hundreds of thousands of people of the Orthodox faith&mdash;Greek, Russian, Serbian, other parts of Europe and the Middle East&mdash;have made to the development of a very diverse, culturally and racially tolerant community in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He will be visiting most states. He will meet a variety of religious, political and civic leaders. I will host a luncheon in honour of him as will the Governor-General. I will also be represented at a special wreath&hyphen;laying service at the Australian Hellenic War Memorial which commemorates those Australians and Greeks who fought together in the battles on mainland Greece and on Crete.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On behalf of the Australian government, I want to wish him a very successful and rewarding visit. My only regret is that my departure to the APEC ministerial meeting halfway through his visit will mean that on one part of his journey to Australia, which includes a visit to my own electorate of Bennelong to observe the excellent work of one of the Greek welfare organisations, I will be absent from the country and will therefore not be able to receive him on my electoral home soil, so to speak. I hope he has a very enjoyable visit. He is an honoured guest in Australia. He is a very significant spiritual figure to many hundreds of thousands of Australians and a great person of stature and dignity throughout the world.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GJ4">Mr WARWICK SMITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the members of the Labor Party: this is not a matter about reef tax or anything else; this is a matter of fundamental importance to the environment on the reef. What is proposed by the Great Barrier Reef authority, after having had considerable and lengthy public consultation, is to have some research into the impacts of line fishing on the Great Barrier Reef. I am pleased to report to the House that, after lengthy debate in the Senate yesterday, this research will, in effect, be an environmental impact assessment. It will provide, for the first time, clear information about the ecosystem and how it will respond to fishing pressure. The information is vitally important if we are to have sustainable and managed fisheries on the Great Barrier Reef.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should point out to honourable members and also to others that there are 500 reefs in the Barrier Reef, and that five per cent in the marine park are closed to fishing. Only eight <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6827"> of these reefs will be opened, and only for one year. This will be offset by closing eight reefs that are currently open for five years. Whichever way you look at it, the project will not be impacting on all of the remaining protected areas.

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GJ4">Mr WARWICK SMITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to that. The project will look at the population, size, age and reproductive structure of fish on the reef. This is vital information for estimating what level of fishing is actually sustainable. The effects of line fishing will tell us what annual rate of fishing causes the fish stocks to change and how the fish stocks will respond to future changes in the fishing effort.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Importantly, the project will also give us information about the relationship between the catch rate and the number of fish left in the water. The critical point is that GBRMPA is determined to avoid the errors and problems we have seen in other fish areas throughout the world. Without this information, we could see the fishing areas collapse, as has happened in other areas around the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the information of members, major matters were raised in the Senate yesterday. Firstly, I want to assure the House that all relevant legislation has been complied with and that the relevant acts will be complied with before any reefs are opened. Information was provided to the Senate yesterday and questions asked in the Senate by the opposition were responded to at length by Senator Hill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> He made a number of commitments. The government is committed to ensuring that the information gained from this project is promptly applied to the management of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and that monitoring mechanisms will be put in place to ensure that irreparable damage is not caused.

That is a matter that we have sought to address.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say something else about policies of other parties in this matter. The Australian Democrats and the Greens would have us believe that the number of migrants entering Australia should not exceed the number of permanent departures over the previous year. If you take the view that you ought to have what they call net zero migration, then you could have only 30,000 entrants in the migration program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you had only 30,000 entrants in the migration program, you would certainly need far more draconian measures than we have put in place.

As far as the relevance of questions to members is concerned, I draw members' attention to the comparison between the two particular standing orders: one relating to questions that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6833"> may be put to a minister, which is standing order 142, and standing order 143, which is questions that may be put to a member. The distinction lies predominantly in the words that are added to questions that may be put to a member when they add the words `connected with the business of the House'. The restraint in the questions that may be put to a member are entirely contained in that restraint, and it is because of the narrowness of the question and `connected with the business of the House' that the disposition of the question must be narrowed in a way that the Leader of the House directed and you yourself suggested when you first called on the honourable member.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank the member for Bowman for her interest in this very important subject. As she said, next Monday is 11 November&mdash;Remembrance Day. I can assure all members of this House that it is a very relevant day to all Australians. The eleventh of November is the day to remember the armistice that brought to an end the Great War of 1914&hyphen;18&mdash;the war that cost 61,720 Australians their lives. It reminds us all of the day that secured peace for the world for 21 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Remembrance Day is a day for us all to remember&mdash;in particular, those who gave their lives so that we can live in peace. It should also be a day for us to reflect on the price that others have paid for that peace, the value of peace and the commitment to defending peace. Next Monday there will be services held throughout the country to commemorate the peace that that armistice of World War I delivered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I invite all Australians to attend one of these services and reflect for a moment on the sacrifices made by successive generations of Australian service men and service women so that we may live as we do today. I will be attending a service at the Shrine of Remembrance in Brisbane and, following that service, I will be unveiling Australia's National Freedom Wall on Mount Coot&hyphen;tha. The wall is covered with almost 16,000 plaques that have been purchased by people all around Australia, by local government and by school children. For many Australians, some of those plaques represent the only significant headstone for many who lie in foreign soils and, for those families, that wall is extremely significant.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Finance. Has the minister seen a recent report that the Commonwealth's net borrowing program will fall dramatically as a result of the government's $4 billion deficit reduction commitment in this financial year? Is this report accurate and is it the case that, as a result of the government's deficit reduction program, the value of Commonwealth debt repayments is expected to be greater than the value of new debt issued?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="6835" SPEAKER="Fahey, John, MP" NAMEID="HQ5" ELECTORATE="Macarthur" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Finance" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HQ5">Mr FAHEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. I can confirm that I have seen the report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  that was entitled `Treasury warns of market shake&hyphen;up'. I am happy to acknowledge that the report itself was accurate. The financial markets may well be shaken up at the prospect of having to give up some of the lucrative lending to the Commonwealth which they got used to during the years of Labor's dependency on debt and deficit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Financial Markets Association were told this week that, as a result of the 1996&hyphen;97 budget, the net borrowing program of the government would fall to just $700 million&mdash;down from $14 billion in the 1994&hyphen;95 year. They heard first&hyphen;hand from a Treasury official that, between the end of June 1997 and the end of June 2000, the volume of Commonwealth government securities on issue is expected to fall from a current high of 23 per cent of gross domestic product to a low of around 16 per cent of gross domestic product.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The commitment of the government to achieving a budget surplus means that in 1997-98 the net value of Commonwealth debt repayments is expected to be greater than the value of new debt issued. That means that we are paying off Labor's bankcard bill, not adding to the debt. It means the end of the Labor debt drip. It means that the Labor Party <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> policy of intergenerational debt transference is coming to an end. It means the beginning of starting to pay our way, of living within our means.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some in the financial markets might regard the end of debt dependency as a shake&hyphen;up, but the government offers no apology for this. This government is committed to moving the budget into surplus and reducing public debt. That is the Howard government's contribution to reducing the foreign debt that the Labor Party racked up over 13 years. It is about time that, in the interests of this nation, the Labor Party joined the government in ensuring that the budget we have put in place, the budget that will bring about deficit reduction, is passed as soon as possible.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

Is the minister aware of a table prepared by his department which shows the projected level of growth in Commonwealth schools funding in real terms&mdash;and I emphasise real terms, not the nominal figures he loves to quadruple, count and cite? Does this table show the real level of Commonwealth tied funding for schools falling each year from $1.385 billion in 1996-97 to $1.298 billion in 1999-2000? Will the minister now cease his absurd claims about an extra $2.3 billion for government schools and frankly acknowledge that the cut in tied funding, together with the cut in general revenue assistance to the states, means that the Commonwealth's contribution to the funding of public schools is set to fall substantially? Does this give effect to the coalition's long-term ideologically&hyphen;driven plan expressed by him secretly in opposition and hidden in the election to deliberately encourage students to move from the government to the non-government sector?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BT4">Dr KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The ideological Left in the Labor Party is today in complete disarray over schools policy because the fact is that the Commonwealth's spending on government schools over the next four years will be rising in real terms. I have had the department calculate the real increase in funding that will be flowing to schools from the Common <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6836"> wealth through the specific purpose grants program and through the financial assistance grants. I can inform the honourable member for Sydney that the Commonwealth contributions to government schools through these grants programs will grow by four per cent in real terms between 1996 and the year 2000.</PARA></TALK.START>

We are determined to raise the quality of schooling in the government sector and in the non-government sector. When you start to see past your ideological blinkers, you will be able to accept the fact that at last someone has picked up the flag on behalf of government school quality and put in place programs that will give government school students literacy and vocational education programs that will lead them on to real jobs.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am able to inform the member for Indi that it will be my very great pleasure to attend a ceremony in the very fine city of Benalla in his electorate associated with the unveiling of a very impressive memorial to the late Sir Edward `Weary' Dunlop. In the words of Sir Ninian Stephen, who delivered the eulogy at his funeral service in Melbourne in 1993, Weary Dunlop probably joins Mawson and one or two Australians as one of the most revered people who have ever given service to this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is remarkably appropriate that this ceremony should take place on Remembrance Sunday. Weary Dunlop's great contribution to humanity occurred during World War II on <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Burma&hyphen;Thailand railway and subsequently as a medical practitioner. He was a very remarkable person. I understand he was the first Victorian to ever play rugby union for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Along with that, he achieved many remarkable things for his country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) raised a matter of privilege in connection with a letter he had received expressing views on maters of immigration and related issues, and concluding with a threat to him. He also referred to telephone calls of a similar nature received in his office. The honourable member subsequently made further comments to me and provided me with a copy of the letter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, in relation to the letter, the substance of the honourable member's complaint is that the letter amounts to improper interference in the performance of his duties as a member. I have examined a copy of the letter the honourable member has provided to me. The letter is quite irrational and grossly offensive. Whilst I recognise it is important that members be protected from improper interference in the performance of their work, the fact is that this letter, unfortunately, is anonymous. In these circumstances, I am not prepared to allow precedence to a motion on the matter on the basis of the letter alone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, in discussions which I have had with the honourable member for Calwell, he reported to me that he has been informed by other honourable members that, following the parliament's unanimous passing of a motion on immigration and related issues last week, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6837"> a number of members have received similar letters and telephone calls. I share the member for Calwell's concern that this may be a broader phenomenon which poses a challenge to MPs in the performance of their duties.</PARA>

<QUESTION PAGE="6837" SPEAKER="Sharp, John, MP" NAMEID="AJ4" ELECTORATE="Hume" PARTY="NP" MINISTERIAL="Transport and Regional Development" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AJ4">Mr SHARP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday, the honourable member for Melbourne asked me a question to which I was unable to provide adequate detail in my answer and I said I would get back to him with a response as soon as possible. Today, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority has provided me with detailed advice on the question asked by the honourable member for Melbourne.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following a report to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority by a maintenance organisation in December 1995 that the honourable member for Capricornia had personally carried out maintenance on his Cessna 310 aircraft, a survey of the aircraft was conducted by the authority which showed that unauthorised, substandard maintenance had been undertaken. The regional Civil Aviation Safety Authority office did not recommend, as the honourable member for Melbourne claimed, that the matter be referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions for prosecution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 3 September 1996, following an investigation of the matter, the District Airworthiness Manager in Townsville recommended:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . on the basis that Mr Marek had no previous airworthiness history of non-compliance, the appropriate enforcement action would be formal counselling of Mr Marek in accordance with CASA's enforcement policy. The Regional Manager agreed with the proposed approach.</PARA>
<PARA>To further answer the honourable member for Melbourne's questions, the decision not to prosecute the member for Capricornia was not taken, as the honourable member for Melbourne claims, by the Deputy Director of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> CASA, Mr John Pike, after the March 1996 federal election. As is normal practice, the District Airworthiness Manager discussed with the regional manager the question of what action should be taken in relation to the maintenance deficiencies that had been identified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A range of possible enforcement actions were discussed. The regional manager advised the Deputy Director about the investigation. The Deputy Director asked whether the aircraft involved was used in private or commercial operations. The Direct Airworthiness Manager in Townsville advised:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Mr Marek had no previous history of airworthiness non-compliance and operated the aircraft privately.</PARA>
<PARA>Under CASA's enforcement procedures, one of the enforcement actions available to CASA is formal counselling. It is standard CASA practice to engage in a formal counselling process in relation to regulatory breaches, particularly where such breaches do not involve commercial operations carrying fare paying passengers. Such procedures are designed to achieve a higher degree of aviation safety by encouraging voluntary compliance by the industry in appropriate cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member asked whether the decision was taken in the face of further protests from the Civil Aviation Safety Authority's regional office which pointed out that another pilot had been prosecuted recently for very similar offences. I am advised by CASA that this is also not correct. I am advised:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In discussions between the Regional Office, the District Office and Central Office reference was made to an earlier case which had been referred to the DPP. However, the Regional Manager agreed with the approach recommended by the District Airworthiness Manager in Townsville in this particular case.</PARA>
<PARA>Those actions were not taken with my knowledge, authorisation or instruction. My office was advised orally by CASA in early September 1996 of the decision taken to proceed with formal counselling action of Mr Marek. That was the first advice of any airworthiness matter involving Mr Marek. My office was not advised of the detail on the occasion for the counselling but of the fact of it. It was further orally advised by CASA that the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6838"> results of the counselling had been satisfactory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be inappropriate for me to intervene in enforcement actions taken by CASA. No favoured treatment&mdash;I repeat, no favoured treatment&mdash;was sought for Mr Marek at any time, nor was any given. I, therefore, take this opportunity to totally refute the claims made by the honourable member for Melbourne. In addition, I will table all of the information provided me today by CASA, which further substantiates this answer.</PARA>

I am the holder of a current private pilot's licence with a twin endorsement and the owner of a Cessna 310 aircraft.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 30 September, Mr George Ivory and Mr Peter Bryant of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority interviewed me regarding irregularities in the maintenance of my aircraft. The visit, they said, was to ensure my understanding of my responsibilities as a pilot as distinct from those as a licensed aircraft maintenance engineer. They accepted that, with respect to a defect notice, most of the responsibility rested with licensed aircraft maintenance engineers in the past. The interview was concluded satisfactorily by the statement that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> no action would be taken against me and there appeared to have been a misunderstanding. As far as this case is concerned, it is now closed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At all times I have sought to comply with the obligations set by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. I recognise the need for my aircraft to be appropriately inspected by licensed aircraft maintenance engineers and for necessary approvals to be issued before flight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have appropriately met my responsibilities and recognised that it is only if I failed to rectify the defects and did not abide by the regulations, as with any other individual, that questions about prosecution would arise. As far as I am aware there has been no basis on which any decision to prosecute me has been taken.

<ROLE>Minister for Health and Family Services)</ROLE>
<TIME.STAMP>(3.45 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;In September 1936, the Governor&hyphen;General made an Order in Council which established the National Health and Medical Research Council to assume the role of advising the Commonwealth, the states and the community on health matters and the allocation of funds for medical research. This year, the National Health and Medical Research Council is celebrating 60 years of providing Australian governments with expert advice across the great range of issues that fall under the health portfolio.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the first formal meeting of the NHMRC held in Hobart in February 1937, the then Commonwealth Minister for Health, Billy Hughes, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia, priding herself on being a nation, ought not to be satisfied to follow, to imitate, to duplicate. She must blaze a track for herself, seek to lead rather than follow: and this calls for the services of specialists of high repute to train, inspire, and guide research along right lines.</PARA>
<PARA>At the time Australia was struggling with diseases such as poliomyelitis&mdash;a struggle which was to continue until the vaccine was introduced in 1955.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst we may no longer worry about the spread of polio, the challenges we still face in population health are great. Today skin cancer in Australia is still the highest per head in the world; HIV&hyphen;AIDS, after 15 years of being with us, still has no cure; and, although reduced, we are still working out why our young continue to die of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to pay tribute to the dedication and, to a significant extent, voluntary contributions of all members of the council, its many committees and the wider community of health and medical professionals who have assisted the council with its work over these 60 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the government announced its health throughout life program it drew attention to its broad priorities for investment in health and medical research and a culture of evidence based practice in health care. The National Health and Medical Research Council has supported these priorities, as can be illustrated by the 1997 research grants. The 1996 budget provided significant funding increases for health and medical research through a number of initiatives, not only for the National Health and Medical Research Council.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia contributes about two per cent of the world health and medical research effort&mdash;well above what might be expected from our population base. This level represents an investment in health and medical research across all disciplines by government, private bodies and the business sector. It means that Australia has a role in the international research scene as a significant player. It punches above its weight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The National Health and Medical Research Council funds about 22 per cent of Australia's health and medical research activity. This research represents the very best of Australian health and medical research with funding being awarded only to those who meet extremely stringent standards. It therefore gives me the greatest pleasure to announce today that I have approved health and medical research awards worth $159.8 million to be made by the National Health and Medical Research Council in 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These awards, which include research project grants, large program grants, block grants to institutes and a range of career and training awards are a demonstration of the government's commitment to maintaining Australia's highly regarded health and medical research base. The funding of $159.8 million covers research which is continuing from previous years to the value of $96.6 <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6842"> million; new and renewed research awards totalling $54.7 million; and funding allocated for special research projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has a worldwide reputation for the quality of its health and medical research&mdash;demonstrated in the last few weeks with the announcement of the award of the Nobel Prize for medicine to Professor Peter Doherty and Dr Rolf Zinkernagel for work they did 20 years ago at the John Curtin School of Medical Research when both were young post-doctoral researchers investigating cells which form part of our body's immune system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not least as part of Australian research efforts funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council, strokes and heart attacks have been reduced by half over the past 25 years, saving 54,000 lives from strokes alone; cot deaths have been reduced by nearly half in two years; kidney failure has been prevented in thousands of Australians; cost and illness associated with stomach and duodenal ulcers has been reduced by the discovery of a bacterial cause and a short course of treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must recognise that research does not produce overnight results. Funding of research is a long&hyphen;term investment to gain improvements in health. It is important that the support of basic research such as that conducted by Doherty and Zinkernagel is maintained at the same time as targeting research funding to areas of health concern requiring more immediate attention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of significant links have been forged with other countries and other research funding bodies. The National Health and Medical Research Council has established memorandums of understanding on research cooperation with Germany and Switzerland. It has been involved in cooperative workshops with Japanese researchers. It has an arrangement for exchange training fellowships with its equivalent organisation in France and shared funding arrangements with the Menzies Foundation for a training fellowship to be held in the United Kingdom. These are important partnership activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also important for Australian health and medical research is the investment of overseas funding bodies in Australian research. I am <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> also delighted to announce that the Wellcome Trust of the United Kingdom has advised me that next year, in recognition of the strength of Australian science and the impetus given by the increased funding for health and medical research in this year's budget, it will commit funding for the support of Australian medical research at approximately 2&half; times its current level. This increase will bring the Wellcome Trust contribution to Australian medical research to about $10 million per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Wellcome funding will be provided for various purposes. A significant portion will be to enable researchers to purchase major items of equipment&mdash;a very valuable contribution to the research effort. Other funding will be for a range of fellowship and training awards, especially for collaborative biomedical research work in the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region. Australian researchers will also have access to Wellcome Trust grants in the area of population and reproductive health studies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Among the new research grants to be awarded by the National Health and Medical Research Council in 1997 is one to the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research&mdash;an outstanding example of Australia's contribution to the international medical research scene&mdash;which will receive renewed funding for five years for its wide range of research programs which cover aspects of diabetes, cancer and malaria. The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute will receive over $8 million per annum as a block grant towards its investigations of the complex cellular and genetic mechanisms of the body.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another area of research to receive considerable new funding in 1997 is into musculo-skeletal diseases. This includes $1 million for new studies relevant to arthritic diseases. A number of projects will be funded, including a study at the University of New South Wales, which will assess the most appropriate and cost&hyphen;effective treatments for common arthritic conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Research into asthmatic disease will also receive considerable funding. Over $1 million will be awarded for new research projects investigating aspects of asthmatic disease, including the links between various allergens <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6843"> and the development of asthma, preventive strategies and appropriate medication.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Research projects and training awards in the area of HIV&hyphen;AIDS will amount to $4.7 million in 1997. The problem of youth suicide will also receive attention. Studies will be funded into adolescent depression, deliberate self&hyphen;harm and substance abuse. One of the projects will include a collaboration with the Victorian Department of Education to provide suicide prevention health education programs in Victorian schools. Another will be investigating the long&hyphen;term effectiveness of psychological intervention in preventing the development of depression in adolescents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wanted to use this time in the House to reinforce the commitment the government has made to the National Health and Medical Research Council. For all diseases for which we find a cure there will always be new challenges ahead. As a society, we are making real progress in both fighting disease and promoting better health. Life expectancy for a male has increased from 59 years in 1920-22 to 75 years in 1994. For a female, life expectancy has gone from 63 years in 1920-22 to 81 years today. As Billy Hughes said when he first addressed the National Health and Medical Research Council:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To this Council of War against Disease I come to bid its members welcome. . . hope that their wisdom, experience and skill will evolve such plans as will result in further triumphs over disease and conduce mightily to the health and happiness of the people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Sixty years on, the message has not changed. I congratulate the NHMRC on reaching its 60th anniversary. I give particular congratulations to Professor Dick Smallwood, who has chaired the NHMRC for the past three years and is about to stand down as chair, and I thank the very large number of eminent Australians who contribute to its functioning in medical research, public health and health ethics.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;On behalf of the opposition I would like to join the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) in congratulating the National Health and Medical Research Council on its 60th birthday. I also congratu <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> late it on the great work it has done in supporting medical research and the promotion of good health outcomes in Australia over the last 60 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The National Health and Medical Research Council was created in 1936, as the minister has outlined, to replace the Federal Health Council, which had been created 10 years earlier. The aim was, of course, to expand the role of the former body to include research. The Federal Health Council and its successor, the NHMRC, were created following the recommendation of the royal commission on health in 1926 that a system of cooperation was necessary between the states, which, under the constitution, had legislative powers in regard to health. But it was the Commonwealth which had the resources to ensure effective administration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The NHMRC provides an excellent example of effective federalism. The council includes representatives from federal, state and territory governments, as well as representatives of the medical schools and the various medical colleges. Its recommendations have encouraged legislative changes in all jurisdictions. This has clearly proved to be a sound and very successful model in this and other areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is perhaps indicative of the bipartisan support that the NHMRC was to enjoy that the first council meeting was opened by Billy Hughes in February 1937. I think the Acting Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) would agree with me that we in the Labor Party would consider there was no Australian politician who could claim to be the embodiment of bipartisanship more than Billy Hughes.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr LEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He did draw the line at the Country Party; I would have to agree with that. He described the role of the new body as being `to promote the health of the people of Australia and to protect them from disease, and to advise, coordinate and direct research into the cause of and cure for those diseases which levy so heavy a toll upon the com <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6844"> munity and which have hitherto baffled medical science'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that the initial grant to the NHMRC was only &pound;30,000 and that the inaugural council dealt with 68 applications for funding. The applications ranged from requests for grants of a measly &pound;75 through to the princely sum of a massive &pound;1,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the Second World War the NHMRC played a very important role in proving the importance of carrying out medical research in Australia for Australia's needs. A great deal of work was done on looking at ways to minimise the risks to Australians serving in time of war. In particular, a lot of work was done in developing the first anti-gravity suits for fighter pilots and work was done by Farley on the control of malaria during the campaign in Papua New Guinea. All of these things contributed greatly towards minimising the risk of death for Australian ex-service men and women during the Second World War.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1992 the then minister for health, Brian Howe, established the NHMRC as an independent statutory body with the following four obligations laid out in the National Health and Medical Research Council Act 1992: to raise the standard of individual and public health throughout Australia; to foster the development of consistent health standards between the various states and territories; to foster medical research and training in public health research and training throughout Australia; and to foster consideration of ethical issues relating to health.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This statement of objectives highlights the NHMRC's crucial role in combining medical research and public health. This combination has encouraged the effective translation of research into practical health measures which have seen the NHMRC play such a crucial role over the last 60 years in helping Australia and the world to combat cardiovascular disease, sudden infant death syndrome and kidney failure, to mention just a few.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The council's research efforts have been vital in establishing the international reputation of Australian medical research and has provided research funding to several of Australia's Nobel laureates, including Sir <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Macfarlane Burnet. As recently as this morning, Australia's most recent Nobel prize winner, Peter Doherty, praised the NHMRC as a great Australian institution, a sentiment with which I am sure all members of the House would agree.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The council's current research program includes a focus on issues of immunity, new medical technologies, healthy ageing and the health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The advisory program is concentrating on a range of contemporary issues such as immunisation, diabetes and depression, as well as strokes, heart disease and cancer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In assessing the importance of the NHMRC, the best thing I can do is quote another great former minister for health for Australia, and that is Neal Blewett, who, on the occasion of the NHMRC's 50th anniversary, said that the work of the council was now so vital that `if it were not here, then it would have to be invented'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's commitment to the NHMRC was well demonstrated in the 1995 budget, our last budget, which increased research funding by about $60 million. Whilst the opposition is pleased with a number of initiatives related to medical research, which the minister has mentioned in his own contribution today, the Labor Party remains concerned that the government's changes to research and development tax concessions and changes to funding for universities will have a significant and, unfortunately, negative effect on medical research in our country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This coalition government has only been in office now for eight months but it already has firmly established itself as a low growth, low jobs government absolutely obsessed with reducing the size of government but not at all obsessed about the plight of those more than 800,000 Australians who are now unemployed and not at all obsessed about addressing the fears of those who are deeply anxious that they might be unemployed if the economy continues to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> deteriorate in the way that it has been ever since it has been in office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is, after all, quite an achievement to take an economy that had grown at an average of four per cent a year over the last three years of the previous government's term of office and which was moving ahead at close to five per cent annual growth in March, and slow it to a crawl in a matter of months. But that is what this government has done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite an achievement to take an economy where unemployment had dropped from 11 per cent to 8&half; per cent over three years, in which 700,000 new jobs had been created over that period and which was well on its way to achieving a target of no more than five per cent unemployment by 2001, and transform it into an economy where job growth has slowed to a walk, where unemployment, as we have seen this morning, has now increased to 8.8 per cent, where youth unemployment has dramatically increased and where nobody is now predicting better than eight per cent unemployment by the end of the century with many more pessimistic predictions even than that. But all of that is what this government has done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not an exaggeration to say, as I have been saying, that the Australian economy is dead flat&mdash;flat as the Nullarbor Plain and flat as a billiard table at the moment. That is the anecdotal evidence and that is the statistical evidence. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has become very fond of saying&mdash;he was saying it again in question time today, as indeed all governments under stress tend to say&mdash;that the opposition has been talking down the economy. I reject that charge. I reject it absolutely. But I have certainly been expressing a number of concerns about the current condition of the Australian economy, and in that I have not been alone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me remind you of some of the other people who have been expressing concerns in recent days about the Australian economy. Rory Robertson of Bankers Trust:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the economy is screaming out for a decent stimulus . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Saul Eslake at ANZ:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . economic activity remains sluggish . . .  <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6846"> </PARA>
<PARA>Chris Caton, again of Bankers Trust:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . retail activity is still moribund . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Deborah Stirling of Coles Myer:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . overall it is still pretty tough going . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Max Walsh, from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> :</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The economy is under&hyphen;performing what was expected in August.</PARA>
<PARA>John Watson of the National Farmers Federation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . business surveys continue to paint a picture of declining production and only moderate outlook for sales in 1997.</PARA>
<PARA>Michael Heffernan of Shaw Stockbroking:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we are not travelling as well as we should . . . </PARA>
<PARA>After the interest rate cut, Bob Herbert of MTIA said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The interest rate cut represents a recognition of the toughness of economic conditions for large sections of Australian industry and the fact that an early recovery cannot be taken for granted.</PARA>
<PARA>Ron Silberberg of the Housing Industry Association, no traditional friend of the Labor Party, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There's a lot of evidence that the economy has virtually stalled. Unemployment rates seem stuck at an uncomfortably high level. Retail sales are very sluggish. This was needed to try and kick start the economy.</PARA>
<PARA>Then, of course, Jeff Kennett, never backward in coming forward in commenting on the state of the economy under Treasurer Costello, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We needed to really give the economy a bit of a boost.</PARA>
<PARA>So much for me, so much for the Labor Party, so much for anyone else on our side of politics talking the economy down. The truth of the matter is that the Australian economy is down&mdash;down on its knees, slowed to a walk, slowed to a crawl, and it is a function of some lousy economic management on behalf of the coalition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">None of what these people has been saying is just rhetoric. If people are doomsaying it is because they are worried. If business representatives and spokesmen are expressing real concern about the economy, it is because <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> there is a mass of hard, factual evidence now available to justify those expressions of concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just look at the string of economic indicators that has been released over the last few months. The ABS business expectations survey shows that business is preparing for the smallest December increase in sales since the survey commenced in 1993. There has been the latest National Australia Bank survey, which reports that, weighted for employment size, a net balance of 40 per cent of firms say that the budget will have a negative effect on their business plans. So much for the confidence boost that the budget was going to generate. So much for the animal spirits that were going to come tearing out of their cages, slavering with enthusiasm for the economic task after this government's budgetary excitement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Westpac-Melbourne Institute consumer sentiment index shows that consumer confidence is 4.2 per cent lower now than it was last February and fully nine per cent lower than it was, in fact, in June. Figures have come out about trend retail sales growth which went backwards in September for only the third time since the Australian Bureau of Statistics started collecting statistics in 1962. I repeat: the trend retail sales growth figures went backwards in September for only the third time since 1962. And you say there is no stress, no strain, no trouble, no flatness in the economy. Who are you kidding?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Capital imports&mdash;a very significant indicator of plant and equipment investment&mdash;were down by 15 per cent in the September quarter as compared with the previous June quarter. The latest long-term unemployment figures, released a few days ago, showed the number of long-term unemployed people has risen each month for the last four months. I am sure my colleague the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) is going to have rather more to say on this subject.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then, of course, there were today's labour force figures, which, again, I know the member for Batman will very much drive home the significance of. Let me state them in summary. These are the figures, of course, which are described by the Minister for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6847"> Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone)&mdash;God help her&mdash;as `basically very good news'. We had figures today&mdash;very good news!&mdash;showing that unemployment had gone back up to 8.8 per cent. Seasonally adjusted, yes&mdash;it rose this month&mdash;but not enough to make up for the 34,000 jobs that were lost last month.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Employment is, in fact, 8,600 below its level two months ago. Full-time employment is 20,600 below what it was two months ago. Trend employment has virtually stalled. To meet the government's own budget night stated target for employment growth, it has to achieve a run rate over the year of two per cent growth. At the moment that run rate is 0.85 per cent. The jobs are simply just not being generated in sufficient numbers even to meet the extraordinarily modest and inadequate target for employment generation that the government has set for itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Trend unemployment has risen yet again. It is now about 800,000 for the first time since November 1994, and youth unemployment has risen from 26.4 per cent in February&mdash;87,000 kids then unemployed&mdash;to 99,600 kids unemployed now, an increase of 14.5 per cent and an overall figure of 29.6 per cent. That is a particularly disgusting statistic for youth unemployment figures. It should be a particularly embarrassing statistic for the Prime Minister, because it was the Prime Minister, then the Leader of the Opposition, who, just before the election, at the National Press Club, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have gone into this election campaign committing ourselves above all other things to doing something effective . . . to reduce the level of youth unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I would like to see our performance in that area as being the mark of what we have been able to do as a government.</PARA>
<PARA>If that is the test that Prime Minister Howard is setting for himself and his government's performance, it is a test which he has already comprehensively failed&mdash;with a 14.5 per cent increase, 12,000 more kids unemployed than when he came into office. As we said in question time, there is one target that at least looks like being achieved, and that is getting <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the number of young unemployed back to the figure of 158,000, which is what it was back in 1983 when John Howard was last in office with some capacity to influence these things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But those are not the only statistics. They are not the only indications of just how flat the economy is. Yesterday we had the DEETYA leading indicator of employment falling yet again, signalling that the labour market will remain sluggish for many months to come. That is a predictive indicator. Then we have had the latest Westpac leading index of economic activity, which, according to Westpac's general manager of economics, Bill Evans, `offers no immediate prospect of an upswing in the pace of economic growth' and contains the clear message that the `sustained upswing in activity is not likely before the second half of 1997'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has the hide, has the indecency, has the gall to claim yesterday's decision by the Reserve Bank to lower interest rates as being evidence, somehow, of success in economic management. But what was involved in the Reserve Bank decision yesterday was not in any sense a reward for good economic management&mdash;other than a continuation, of course, of the low inflation environment, which was the legacy of the Labor government, something that takes years to achieve and cannot be achieved in a matter of months. We broke the back of it. That continued. Yes, that was there as the underlier. But it was not a reward for good economic management by this government; it was a rescue mission for an economy in distress.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course it is the case that lower interest rates are very helpful for Australian families buying their homes. We welcome them unreservedly&mdash;we want them. But what Australian families also want is greater economic security, and you cannot have greater security without a stronger economy. You need strong growth, rising incomes, if you are going to achieve increasing living standards and if you are going to achieve the most heartfelt objective of all for Australians, and that is falling unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6848"> The government is simply not committed in terms of either its micro&hyphen;economic manage ment or its macro&hyphen;economic management to growth and jobs. If you are looking at its performance so far as micro management is concerned, you have the extraordinary saga, revealing itself over recent days, of just how empty the government's commitment is to doing something about jobs in this respect. When the government was panicked into announcing the creation, at the end of last month, of an employment&mdash;or, more accurately, unemployment&mdash;committee of cabinet&mdash;and it has not met yet, apparently&mdash;the Prime Minister said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in future what the government would endeavour to do is to ask of every policy initiative and every change the question: would it contribute to a generation of jobs?</PARA>
<PARA>This past fortnight, the opposition has been attempting to establish just what that commitment actually means in practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have asked a whole series of questions, you will recall, about how this particular jobs test has been applied to the decisions, for example, to abolish the book bounty, given its impact on the workers of Griffin Press in Adelaide and Maryborough in Victoria; to increase the reef tax, given its impact on the tourism industry workers in North Queensland; to abolish the ships bounty, given its impact on the workers at Austal Ships in WA, and Incat in Tasmania; and to cut R&amp;D support and the machine tools bounty in a way that has had a massive impact already on the workers of Laser Lab in Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have asked questions about each one of those specific policy outcomes and, in each case, the Prime Minister has contemptuously, maybe with the occasional crocodile tear to accompany it, dismissed that concern saying that the individual consequences of these budget decisions were unimportant by comparison to the overall economic strategy of fiscal consolidation which over the long run, he keeps telling us, will yield employment benefits, employment advantages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All those battlers who have lost their jobs since 2 March, and all those who are going to lose them as a result of these various measures biting successively, are not going to be very reassured by that particular bit of Treasury&hyphen;speak. As John Maynard Keynes said, `In <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the long run, we are all dead,' and that is the only prospect that the Prime Minister, Mr John Howard, is offering us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the process of dismissing the opposition's concerns about these specific policy outcomes, the Prime Minister has demonstrated, above all else, the complete emptiness, the cant, associated with his own jobs test. It has been emptied of any meaningful content. Like the Prime Minister's word in so many other areas, it stands as a bloated, empty, hypocritical and insincere piece of bluster.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to macro-economic management, what we obviously need if we are going to be able to generate the jobs and the growth to get the economy moving again is a genuine commitment, with the policy strategies to go with it, to growth of not the three per cent plus that presently seems to satisfy the Treasurer and which he is regarding as a good and credible model and the very model of a model performance, but a sustainable four per cent plus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know from hard experience, from just the sheer arithmetic of it, that you cannot make an impact on unemployment or jobs growth of the kind that will reduce those utterly unacceptable unemployment rates at the moment unless you have a macro&hyphen;strategy, a fiscal strategy, in place which actually has you bouncing back to four per cent or better growth. You simply cannot do it at three per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this government has done is commit itself, through its budgetary approach, to a set of outcomes which will take at least half a per cent of growth out of the economy this year and next and make absolutely unattainable that four per cent. Moreover, it has made it unattainable for the next two years. On its own projections, that is the outcome we are looking at right out to the end of the century with results that we all know deeply unhappily are going to be the case so far as unemployment is concerned. We are looking at unemployment of eight per cent plus, maybe nine per cent plus. It is a disgraceful record. The government ought to hang its head in shame for perpetrating it. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very clear from that contribution by the Acting Leader of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6849"> Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) that neither he nor the Labor Party have learnt one solitary thing from the decisions the people of Australia made on 2 March. He spent 14 minutes going through a series of statistics that he had in front of him that were supposed to support the argument that he was trying to make about the economy at present and spent the last minute saying what the government has to do to get growth back to four per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He made no suggestion of how it might happen. He made no reference to the fact that on 2 March this country found itself with an additional $10 billion of debt as a result of 13 years of Labor mismanagement. He made no reference at all to the fact that if we continued down that path of deficit and debt that Labor had taken us down there was going to be nothing left within a few years for the people of Australia that needed the services of government. He gave no regard whatsoever to the impact debt has on business, industry and government. He made no reference whatsoever to the mismanagement that had gone on in all of that time or to the disgraceful mess that Labor left the country in as a result of that mismanagement during their term in office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I expected more from the Acting Leader of the Opposition this week when I looked at reports from last Sunday's papers and saw the Acting Leader of the Opposition vowing to silence his detractors from the opposition factions within the Labor Party, to take the move that was there to stack the branches, et cetera. He was going to silence the detractors this week. But what did the Acting Leader of the Opposition do in the first question time this week when he could have shown his credentials in this chamber and made a significant contribution that made some sense to the debate in here? He waved imperiously to someone on the back benches to ask the first question in question time this week. In the course of that particular day, he asked three questions, the third of which was ruled out of order.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The week did not get any better. In fact, he has had only one success this week. He tipped the winner of the Melbourne Cup. That is the only time he has got close to doing anything <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> right this week. A little later in the week I noted with some interest that he did a doorstop relating to deeming rates. It was most interesting to see the report in the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> this morning on that particular doorstop. This, of course, is from the spokesman on matters economic for the Labor Party. The Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Evans got in trouble trying to answer a question about whether the Government should cut deeming rates&mdash;but was hazy about what it meant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"I thought it was this Government (which made the change) but it was our Government. . . " he said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The reason for talking at cross&hyphen;purposes was I was on a different wavelength."</PARA>
<PARA>I can assure you that all members on this side of the House believe you are always on a different wavelength. The report went on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Evans said he had given "an inadequate answer" but explained he "wasn't frankly focused on the issue".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"I wobbled a bit on that because I thought they were talking about something different," he said.</PARA>
<PARA>There have been some lousy reviews for the Acting Leader of the Opposition this week. I think the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) can take some comfort from the fact that he is in another country and need not worry about what might be happening back home, because this week the Acting Leader of the Opposition and the spokesman on matters economic has not laid a glove on the current debate in respect of the economy or any other matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question of the economy must always start at 2 March. It starts at that debt which we inherited as a government. We came down here to do a number of things only to find a bar on the high jump so high that it was a daunting task just to look at it. We inherited $10 billion worth of debt. We took the brave decision, because it was the right decision, to bring about fiscal consolidation and to do something about that debt&mdash;a debt that had climbed by some $70 billion in the last five years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Acting Leader of the Opposition can say all he likes about matters relating to growth and what the rate of growth should be. The simple fact is that the growth figures of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6850"> previous years have been at an enormous expense to the Australian community&mdash;an expense of an additional $70 billion of debt. As I have said on a number of occasions, the only growth industry in the Australian economy under Labor was the debt servicing section under the current Leader of the Opposition, the then Minister for Finance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple fact is that this year's budget requires payment of $10 billion in debt servicing alone. It requires the equivalent amount of the education budget for debt servicing. It requires half the health budget just for debt servicing on the debt that has been racked up by Labor in the last five years. It required this government to do something about getting the base in order before we could move this country forward. The budget delivered by the government does just that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget delivered by the government has been accepted widely by all sections of the community. It is recognised that it was the budget that had to be delivered in the circumstances of the economy and the state of the national accounts. There was no choice other than to plunge this country headlong into difficulties it would never recover from. That budget provides for a small surplus in 1998-99. That budget contains within it growth that by any comparison with OECD countries&mdash;three per cent and 3&half; per cent through to the turn of the century&mdash;is quite an acceptable growth, in fact, a very high growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Acting Leader of the Opposition can talk about his four per cent growth achieved by an injection of money that was borrowed to the point where we have to service those debts, as I have just explained. We saw Working Nation. This was the huge design that was put together to satisfy all the difficulties on employment that this nation has. Five billion dollars was factored into the years of Working Nation. What did it do for unemployment? It did not bring it below 8.5 per cent. We were stuck permanently at around 8.5 per cent for 18 months prior to the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose Labor can take consolation in the fact that they presided over the highest unemployment figures since the recession&mdash; <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> unemployment figures of 11.2 per cent. That is a disgrace. It is a disgrace that in the past five years under Labor only 7,000 real jobs have been created. They can throw all the figures they like out there. The reality is that they have created only 7,000 real jobs in five years of administration. I can say that the honourable member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) had a bit to do with that in his former life and the role that he played there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a need for us to get the base in order. The government has done that in a number of ways. We have addressed the paucity of national savings&mdash;again, by reducing the reliance on deficits that the former Labor government placed for so many years. They were addicted to deficits and debt. By moving into surplus we are making our contribution to national savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of other matters that have to be addressed as well. Labor continues to try to block what is necessary to get this country really moving again, particularly in the area of industrial relations. There is no way in the world that businesses can proceed forward under the law as it now stands&mdash;Labor's law. It simply said, `Employ someone if you wish, at your peril. Take your risk, but you have little difficulties, other than through massive payments, of getting rid of someone who does not perform for legitimate reasons. It is simply not possible.' Why would anyone employ in circumstances like that? People did not. Small business did not. We have delivered to small businesses. We have given them the way ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have put that downward pressure on interest rates which has brought about a reduction in home mortgage rates from 10.5 per cent to 8.75 per cent in our eight months of government. That delivers to the ordinary families of Australia a $140 reduction in the payments that they have to make. Nothing could be more significant from the point of view of the average family in this country&mdash;the average person on a home mortgage&mdash;than to have a reduction of $140 in that period. We have seen the official interest rates go down by one per cent through two instalments in that time. We have seen inflation brought down from above three per cent to below <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6851"> three per cent. We have seen moderation in wage growth. All of those factors are there. There is certainty about the forecasts ahead to the extent that investment is possible with certainty by small business in particular.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have received the report of the deregulation task force under the chairmanship of Charlie Bell. They have said, `We are sick of red tape. We are sick of having to spend the time looking after what government requires us to look after instead of getting on with what we do well.' That is a very significant report. The government will work through that with a commitment to reduce the red tape that is associated with business by 50 per cent in our first term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The climate and the base have now been established. Of course, for us to be able to progress on all of that, one of the most important things is for the budget to be delivered intact. Yet day after day we see Labor railing against the measures that have been taken in the budget to bring us into that surplus over the economic cycle which is so important whilst we are in that period of growth, as we are. It is essential that we get back into balance over the economic cycle and get into surplus, as we predict in that budget forecast, by 1998-99.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Day after day, particularly in the Senate, we see attempts being made to pull back on the savings and to pull back on the bottom line&mdash;the honest and transparent bottom line that Labor never produced. They were never interested in underlying balances; they were only interested in headline balances. They sold off the assets as quickly as they could but as quietly as they could because they had to look after what was happening within their own ranks and the disquiet that was there in terms of those sales. They sold off the assets in the past simply to produce money&mdash;cash&mdash;for the consumption of programs that they could not resist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have got a very responsible economic management program in place. It is contained in the budget. The community is waiting to see, and looking forward to seeing, if we can deliver that surplus by 1998&hyphen;99. The community knows that there is a responsible government in place here in Canberra now <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and that there will be an economic climate for growth&mdash;sustainable growth, not the type of growth that we have seen over the past few years with figures of four per cent, no reduction in unemployment, interest rates going higher and higher and inflation creeping up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The result was that there was simply no future in anything that was done in the way of investment by small business. They have faith in what we are progressing through this budget and through our economic management. We will demonstrate that faith with stable low interest rates and sustained low inflation, under the direction of the Reserve Bank and the target that it has set itself and made very clear, to a point where people can invest with certainty. Certainty is something that has been lacking within the business community and the entire Australian community for far too long now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The matter that the Acting Leader of the Opposition raises today is more a wish than reality. It is a wish that Labor continue to try to propagate. They try to put out the story that all is doom and gloom. They do not like the fact that in the budget investment in the business sector is forecast at 14 per cent. They are not prepared to talk about the debts that they ran up in the past. They want to talk down the economy today to continue to discourage the community out there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The community recognised that your management was not worth anything. They demonstrated that in their vote on 2 March. They have made it abundantly clear that they want us to progress. They said that in Lindsay only a couple of weeks ago. They made it very clear they want us to get on with the job. They want us to put our budget in place. If the Labor Party were serious in any shape or form about the future of this country and about the future of jobs for young people, people of all ages, then they would immediately start to assist the government to progress the budget through the Senate. They would immediately start to do something about the workplace relations bill in the other chamber. They would allow it to be put in place at the earliest possible time instead of standing up and constantly talking down the economy as <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6852"> much as they possibly can.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well might the Australian community ask, `When is this government going to face up to the fact that the only issue that counts at the moment is the question of jobs, jobs and more jobs?' I'll tell you what: the Australian community expects this government to face up to the fact that jobs are the priority rather than consuming itself with a mistaken view&mdash;which is poll driven&mdash;of a deficit fetish. I'll tell you what: I listened with interest to the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey)&mdash;someone not known to have a desire or an ability to make decisions, as was proven in the state of New South Wales.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to refer the Minister for Finance to his suggestion that Australia is a country hocked to the hilt. I understand why he is running away today in the same way he ran away from Macquarie Street. It is because he doesn't like facts. I think he ought to table in this House a report by the Treasury on Monday this week which went to the very question of debt. I know he does not like reading these reports. He is not really a person who concerns himself with facts, especially the facts with respect to his own register of property holdings. That report by Treasury says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian general government net financial liabilities&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is Treasury&hyphen;speak for net debt; I am sure the Minister for Finance, who just ran from the chamber, wouldn't understand that&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">as a per cent of nominal GDP are relatively low by international standards, being lower than all OECD countries other than Japan, and lower than the OECD average.</PARA>
<PARA>I will later seek leave to table that Treasury report. But, in doing so, I say that I think the Australian community is entitled to say to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) today, `Why are you coy on prospects with respect to jobs?' Why did the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  of 10 October have a heading which stated `More pressure for rate cut&mdash;Jobs growth elusive'? I think the Australian community is entitled to say to the Prime Minister, `Where have the jobs gone?'</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More importantly, in light of the establishment by the Prime Minister on 21 October of an unemployment committee of cabinet, the Australian community is entitled to ask, `Where are the jobs going to come from?' That is the real question. I'll tell you what: the Prime Minister does not know and, more importantly, the minister with responsibility for employment in the government&mdash;that well&hyphen;known heavyweight, Senator Vanstone&mdash;wants the Australian community to have faith that she is concerned about the issue of employment. I'll you what: the Australian community listening to the minister for employment today on the ABC radio program <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The World Today</EMPHASIS> would have very serious doubts. We know she likes to live in fantasyland, and we know that she is not too concerned with the facts from time to time. But I'll tell you what: what is a bigger worry is that she doesn't know what they are going to do as a government in their cabinet unemployment committee established on 21 October. Here is what she had to say about the question of coming to terms with reducing the level of unemployment. It goes to the question of responsibility. What did she say on the ABC today? She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And all we're saying is, it won't change just because you've got different people sitting in government, swapping sides in the Chamber.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>I'll tell you what: she ought to be on this side of the chamber because, without a doubt&mdash;and the facts prove it today beyond any doubt&mdash;unemployment is rising and it is rising fast. Then Senator Vanstone was questioned about the Prime Minister's pivotal cabinet committee to reduce unemployment, which is, all of a sudden, going to meet this afternoon. I'll tell you what: it's going to meet every month from here on in to try to create the impression, when the unemployment figures come out, that the government is going to do something.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have expected that, when unemployment went up to 8.8 per cent today, the minister for employment&mdash;it is her responsibility&mdash;could have at least said to the ABC, `I've got a few ideas and I want to tell the Australian community, which is concerned about unemployment, what I'm going to recommend to the cabinet's committee on <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6853"> unemployment today to reduce unemployment.' What was her answer? She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Look, I think the Prime Minister's entitled to be a bit annoyed if I share with the world at large what I'm going to tell a cabinet subcommittee.</PARA>
<PARA>I'll tell you what: the real problem is that not only doesn't the minister for employment know; she's got an even bigger hide, because this is what she also said on ABC radio at noon today in response to questions about the totally unacceptable level of unemployment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So, basically very good news.</PARA>
<PARA>I'll tell you what: I do not accept that basically it is very good news that today 20,600 fewer full&hyphen;time jobs exist compared with what we had two months ago. I do not accept that it is basically very good news today that we have 9,000 fewer jobs overall than we had two months ago&mdash;you know, the real jobs that the Prime Minister said he was going to create instead of destroy. I do not accept that it is basically very good news today that unemployment has gone from 8.7 to 8.8 per cent. But worse still&mdash;and the minister likes to talk about the trend rate&mdash;what is the trend rate today? `Basically, very good news,' says the minister. I'll tell you what it is: it is 8.7 per cent, which is the highest level in 18 months. Very good news! I'll tell you what: I would hate to see bad news. But it is worse still. The Prime Minister, on election eve, said to the National Press Club:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have gone into this election campaign committing ourselves above all other things to do something effective.</PARA>
<PARA>He was not talking about his ministerial code of conduct, because we know that is in tatters. He went on to say that he was talking about reducing the level of youth unemployment, and he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would be a very disappointed man if I had not made very serious inroads into the level of youth unemployment in this country because I would like to see our performance in this area as being the mark of what we have been able to do as a Government.</PARA>
<PARA>Well, this is the mark of what this government has done on the question of youth unemployment. I find it strange that the minister for employment also said today that this is `basically very good news'. I'll tell you what: young Australians are suffering most of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> all from the failure of this government to perform on the employment front. `Very good news,' the minister says, that youth unemployment has shot up to 29.6 per cent&mdash;29.6 per cent and it is very good news!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Reducing youth unemployment was supposed to be a priority. I'll tell you what: it is not a priority, but the way it is going, the Prime Minister will break the record he set when he last was Treasurer with respect to youth unemployment. You know what? He is not far off that record. We have tipped 99,600 today. He is fast moving to his last record, of 158,000. I know he does not like to be reminded of records, but I think the Australian community is entitled to know where all the jobs have gone. We do not accept that they ought to go to the graveyards. We expect that this Prime Minister ought to learn from his past mistakes and state to the Australian community that jobs and jobs alone are the priority at the moment. The reason is that the Australian community is no longer prepared to accept his con.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decision of 21 October to establish an unemployment committee was a sham and it will be seen by the Australian community for what it is. They had to wait until today to call a meeting of the unemployment committee to try to create an impression in the Australian community that they are going to do something about jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government's first budget is unfair to people who want jobs. It is unfair to our young people and it is unfair to the mums and dads of Australia who put such an effort into educating their children with a view to giving them a long&hyphen;term meaningful job opportunity. The Australian community says to the Prime Minister today, `Stop the con. Answer the question: where have the jobs gone and&mdash;more importantly&mdash;where are the jobs going to come from?' Because I'll tell you what: they have seen through him. The deficit fetish will not assist him in reducing unemployment.</PARA>

<TIME.STAMP>(4.43 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter of public importance before us today concerns the deterioration of the Australian economy. How come you say that you can see deterioration in the Australian economy now and you could not see it for the past 13 years? Do you remember the years between 1989 and 1993 and the deterioration in the economy then? The opposition has no credibility on employment. The opposition has no credibility any longer on economic management.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Former Prime Minister Keating always boasted that he had his hands on the economic levers and had the Reserve Bank in his pocket. If one were to believe him, you could only conclude that he might have had his hands on the levers but he did not know which levers to pull and in what order. I think a couple of levers were stuck. You were locked in by the accord and all you had available to you to manage the Australian economy was the lever of interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Hawke and Keating governments will be remembered for one thing: they demonstrated that, like every other Labor government in Australian history, Labor cannot manage money. They cannot manage the economy, they cannot manage employment. But they can spend your money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the tradition of the Labor governments of Whitlam, Wran, Cain, Kirner, Bannon and Burke, the Hawke&hyphen;Keating years ensured one thing only, that the tradition of Labor continued&mdash;a tradition of financial irresponsibility, big spending, big debt, big taxes, budget deficits and deceit. I mention deceit because this government came to power on 2 March expecting a budget surplus only to find that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the budget was $8 billion in deficit, and this blew out to $10 billion. That should never happen again to any incoming government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Acting Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans), mentioned John Maynard Keynes in his speech to the House. At first I thought he said `John Cain'. That gave me a bit of fright because I will never forget the promise in 1989 that Wayne Goss gave before the Queensland state election. He said very proudly to the people of Queensland, `Just as business has prospered under the stewardship of John Cain in Victoria so too will business prosper under a Goss Labor government in Queensland.' How prophetic!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a different story under the coalition. Yesterday all Australians were rejoicing at the latest good news on the economic front&mdash;the reduction by the Reserve Bank of official interest rates by 0.5 per cent. This is, of course, very important for the housing industry and the building and construction industries&mdash;the engine of growth in so many parts of Australia, particularly in my own electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is meaningless to consider job figures alone and to try to analyse them in isolation. Employment figures must be looked at in a wider context. The linkage of jobs to other factors was clearly expressed in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunshine Coast Daily</EMPHASIS> today where the Queensland Master Builders Association executive director, Greg Quinn, was commenting on the good news on interest rates. I quote from the article:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the rates drop put housing at its most affordable, the return of confidence in the housing market was due to far more. Mr Quinn said the biggest factor for home buyers&mdash;job security&mdash;had been strengthened by the proposed industrial relations legislation, co&hyphen;written by the government and the Australian Democrats.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a very important linkage. Not only are new jobs important, but also the importance of job security is a critical factor for growth and consumer confidence, and therefore for the future of jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor does not understand that the level of unemployment is a function of many factors. I have been in this place since March 1990 <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6855"> and, for those six years, I saw the Hawke&hyphen;Keating governments lurch from crisis to crisis, putting totally inadequate bandaids on the balloon with one hand while pricking more holes in the balloon with the other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In March 1990 when I came to this place again, unemployment was running at 6.2 per cent; in March 1991 it was 9.2 per cent; in March 1992&mdash;10.5 per cent; in March 1993&mdash;10.9 per cent&mdash;</PARA>

So we inherited an unemployment rate of 8.5 per cent. But, remember, it peaked in December 1992 at 11.2 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill is another bill which demonstrates yet again the dramatic differences between the Labor and Liberal parties. Last week we were debating legislation which increased the level of HECS charges for tertiary students and which brought to a grinding halt that revolution in participation which Labor had achieved in tertiary education with hundreds of thousands of additional tertiary places.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just a day or two ago we were debating the withdrawal of the operational subsidy for community based, non-profit child-care centres, once again where Labor had a legacy of achievement. We had inherited a paltry 46,000 child-care places and built that up during our term in government to some 270,000 child-care places. With the loss of the operational subsidy, once again that revolution in participation comes to a grinding halt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now have a bill before us which relates to industry policy. Labor cut tariffs too enthusiastically in my view, particularly during the 1990-91 period, and it did a lot of damage in my electorate. Our industry policy needs to pay appropriate regard to what other nations are doing. We cannot afford to be suckers here. I am arguing and I will continue to argue in Labor Party forums, before the Productivity Commission and elsewhere that the post-2000 tariff arrangements should not <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6857"> be further reduced unless there is clear evidence of a level playing field internationally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But Labor did not just cut tariffs and leave industry to its own devices. We wanted manufacturing industry to succeed and in particular we wanted it to export. Our industry assistance programs have been extraordinarily successful&mdash;I will provide some figures on that later on. But now we have a government which has no vision of industry policy, which comes stamping into this delicate area like a bull in a china shop, smashing the crockery, smashing the furniture that we had put in place to allow our manufacturing industry to grow and to export.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Make no mistake. The abolition of the bounties, which is the subject of this bill, the slashing of the export market development grants, the slashing of the research and development tax concession and the abolition of the development import finance facility, DIFF&mdash;all these things will jeopardise the competitiveness of Australia's manufacturers, placing them at a disadvantage with our overseas competitors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Liberals have come into government claiming to know something about the needs of business. But when it comes to manufacturing industry, they are like invading hordes of Huns and Visigoths looting, pillaging and smashing everything in sight. They do not appear to have any comprehension, understanding or appreciation of the value of that which they are destroying, of the art and the refinement which has gone into the creation and development of these schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to tell the House something about a particular company in my electorate&mdash;Farley Cutting Systems, which is based in Glenroy. It commenced business in 1983 in Glenroy. Its mission statement is to be a leading world supplier of systems for cutting flat metals and similar materials. It was founded by Mr Peter Farley and achieved early success in penetrating the Australian market with sales of cutting machines into specifically targeted sectors such as shipbuilding and the heating, ventilation and airconditioning industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> That success was based on the relatively quick market acceptance of the innovative and versatile Farley Wizard profile cutting ma chine. Building on the acceptance by the local market, Farley Manufacturing commenced exporting the Wizard in 1985 initially to a similar range of customers in the United Kingdom. Later on, they moved into Europe and by 1989 exports had surpassed domestic sales and total turnover exceeded $A13 million. They opened additional offices in Germany and France. Later they moved into the United States and their most recent stage of market development has been an expansion into the Asian region over the past three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have established a network of agents and achieved machine sales in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, China, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia. A family of 10 machines is now marketed under the Farley banner together with a comprehensive suite of applications software programs. Farley machines are now productively utilised by steel service centres, heavy fabrication and engineering operations, mining and agricultural equipment manufacturers, structural steel fabricators, contract cutting shops and the like.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the course of that company's progress, they have collected numerous awards for both technical and export performance including two Australian Design Awards, the Prince Phillip Award for Design Excellence, the John Hart Technology Award, the Austrade Export Award, the BHP Steel Award and the Governor of Victoria's Export Award. In 1994 and 1995 they received high commendations in the Engineering Excellence Awards conducted by the Institute of Engineers, Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today, Farley Cutting Systems has 300 machine installations in more than 20 countries around the world, a staff of 75 people and turnover in excess of $12 million with exports accounting for approximately 75 per cent of sales. They are actively involved in ongoing research and development activities, including with a range of external partners, and are implementing various manufacturing improvement programs to enhance competitiveness&mdash;not a bad achievement at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at the value to them of industry assistance&mdash;and I visited this company both before and since becoming the member for Wills&mdash;their estimates in 1995-96 were <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6858"> $325,000 from the machine tool bounty, $100,0000 from the export market development grants and $900,000 from the tax concession for research and development. With respect to export market development grants, they claimed substantial assistance under the program from 1984 to 1991, which was a critical phase in enabling them to establish an export focus&mdash;an activity which has become the cornerstone of their business. The new market provisions of the export market development grants are now being utilised to assist them in establishing new export markets such as Malaysia, China and India.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to research and development, they are beneficiaries of the GIRD program and the cooperative research centres program. Both of those schemes have been invaluable to them in enabling them to develop a highly differentiated product and to maintain the leading edge in their field of technology, which is a key element in their international competitiveness. Mr Farley, the company's founder and managing director, told the Senate Economics Legislation Committee just last Friday:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We budgeted this year on $19 million sales and $800,000 profit. But the duty on imported components, $70,000 cost. Reduction of EMDG, $50,000.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reduction of the R&amp;D credit, $70,000 . . . $20,000 in extra compliance cost for the R&amp;D.</PARA>
<PARA>So much for the government getting rid of red tape for small business. The thing which really knocks them around is cancellation of the bounty&mdash;$300,000 straight off the bottom line. Mr Farley further said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The things that government actually did will reduce our profit by 60 per cent. The other thing that they have done which is even more disastrous, or that has happened, is just the total collapse of demand in Australia. Our demand in Australia is running at 10 per cent of our budgeted rate.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The orders are a bit lumpy, so you cannot take one month after another, but we have not had a significant order since the election. We normally get in Australia about $400,000 a month. One month it is $1.2 million and then the next two months it is nothing. But since the election we have not had one significant order. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The thing that has saved us is our exports to Asia.</PARA>
<PARA>I might say as an aside that I had a street stall in Glenroy last Saturday and some people came up to tell me that `Pauline Hanson is right'. It might be too much to hope that the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) is taking note&mdash;she is not here in the chamber&mdash;but I hope at least those constituents of mine who consider themselves part of her cheer squad might reflect on what it would mean for Glenroy if the Asian countries on which this company depends decided to take their business elsewhere. Mr Farley went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The biggest impact is Australia. It is terrible, it is really disastrous. We are just going backwards at a huge rate of knots. We have sold more machines in Malaysia in the last four months or six months than we have sold in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Later, Mr Farley told the committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This year we have had the dollar go up, the 150 per cent reduction, the demand in Australia go down and the bounty eliminated without notice. You can plan ahead for a certain amount of things, but you cannot plan ahead for the sort of quintuple whammy that we got in the last six months.</PARA>
<PARA>On being questioned by the committee about that falling off of demand since March, he repeated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . since March we have not had a significant order. I do not think any of our customers predicted at the time of the election that they would change their plans depending on the election. Most of them being businesses and most of them, on balance, being supporters of the coalition, one would have expected a lift in their confidence and investment plans, but it has just failed to happen and it has gone backwards. Our order rate in the last six months is less than it was at the bottom of the recession.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>Let me repeat that&mdash;`less than it was at the bottom of the recession'. Mr Farley went on to talk about the benefits of the bounty. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Last year we opened an office in Singapore. In four years we had sold $400,000 worth of stuff in that region. We put that guy there and he has got $3 million worth of orders. We planned, when we did our budget in April this year, to do the same thing in Korea and the same thing in China. We have just had $500,000 taken out of our cashflow.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6859">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The good thing about bounty is it comes quick. You spend some money and you get it back 60 or 90 days later. But with the R&amp;D tax concession or any of the other grants schemes or EMDG or whatever, you have got to finance the expenditure for 12 to 18 months to three years to five years, if it is a tax concession. The bounty was absolutely instrumental in us growing from a nine&hyphen;person company in 1985 to a 100&hyphen;people company now. In 1985 we had exported one machine. Now we have got 300 machines overseas. We just went through the order book this morning and there are 17 machines on order and the very cheapest and smallest of them is the only one on order for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>His comments were supported and echoed by Mr Boland of ANCA, who told the committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I think that with the internationalisation of manufacturing, which is very solid, we are very ephemeral and ANCA could vanish, and there really would not be a ripple in the water. In the broad stream of the economy, we could vanish. The equipment we make is primarily sold in the US and Europe and Asia, and there would be other suppliers to take our place over there. But what you would lose is the employment. We employ 300 people directly, another 200, so you would lose those 500 jobs. You would lose all the taxes we pay, you would lose the technology, you would lose the export revenue we gain.</PARA>
<PARA>Those remarks echo comments I have heard from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) that Australia's survival is not compulsory. Certainly, our survival as a manufacturer is not compulsory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These comments were also echoed by the Metal Trades Industry Association which described the cumulative effect of the loss of such measures&mdash;the DIFF, the EMDG, 150 down to 125 for research and development, industry assistance schemes such as the bounty&mdash;as being profoundly anti-business, profoundly anti-manufacturing and profoundly against the interests of Australia. Interestingly enough, when Mr Farley was asked about the industrial relations changes, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With regard to the benefit of the industrial relations changes, in my view it is not neutral; it is possibly negative because the lack of certainty of the Accord type process is encouraging people who are in demand&mdash;and some of the highly skilled people we use are in demand&mdash;to be much more aggressive. You can see this from the metal trades workers' 15 per cent claim, which they would never have pursued under the Accord. So in my view it is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> negative. There is much more turmoil in the job market for people who are in demand than there has been in the last 10 years.</PARA>
<PARA>I say to the government: do not come in here saying, `Well, we're taking away your bounty and your concessions and your DIFF and your export market development grants, but you'll be all right because we've got rid of the accord.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that the government has taken away from manufacturers the A, B, C, D and E of their competitiveness and international exporting success: A for the accord; B for the bounties; C for the concession for research and development; D for the DIFF, the development import finance facility; and E for the export market development grants. So how do you destroy our manufacturing industry? It is not as easy as ABC. It takes A, B, C, D and E&mdash;but they are doing it. We now have a government which is illiterate. When it comes to industry policy and manufacturing, they will put us in the Z class down with Zaire and Zambia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a bill which not only terminates the machine, tools and robotics bounty, about which I have been speaking, but also terminates the books bounty and the ships bounty with effect from 20 August this year, and the computer bounty with effect from 1 July next year. The abolition of the books bounty will have a significant effect on regional areas, such as Maryborough in Victoria where 25 per cent of the local work force is dependent, either directly or indirectly, on the book production industry. It is extraordinary that the government should be treating Maryborough, which supports a Liberal member of parliament, so poorly. But, in fact, it is similar to the very poor way in which the state Liberal government has treated the people of Maryborough by withdrawing the rail service which used to go through Maryborough to Mildura.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Maryborough has a population of 8,800 people, of which some 2,500 are in the town's work force. Two major book printers have plants in Maryborough and employ directly 550 persons, with another 100 being employed in ancillary businesses such as typesetting and film reproduction; they also use <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6860"> casual labour in peak periods. So some 25 per cent of the work force of the town is directly dependent on book production for its livelihood. Therefore, the people of Maryborough will be most adversely affected through the loss of the book bounty and the passage of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, it is scandalous that in Australia we can have a minister in charge of this bill who has a direct conflict of interest arising from its provisions. The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) has a $100,000 interest in Bligh Ventures. Companies associated with Bligh Ventures in the previous financial year received more than $1 million from the government in computer bounty funding. The computer bounty was not the only bounty, but one of five, to be axed in the budget. Interestingly, it is the computer bounty that gets a stay of life; it gets an extra year. Why is that? Is it because Jtec Pty Ltd, in which Bligh Ventures has an 18.2 per cent holding, is a beneficiary to the tune of $1 million?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister's code of conduct says, `It is important that ministers and parliamentary secretaries avoid giving any appearance of using public office for private purposes.' Yet yesterday the Prime Minister tells the House that he regards it as a `badge of honour'&mdash;that is, ministers should have private shareholdings and be out there making money on the side. He has turned his code of conduct into a national joke.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even without a code of conduct, the concept of conflict of interest is nearly as old as Westminster democracy itself, and it is fundamental. It is that there should be no conflict of interest between the public interest or national interest, which a minister is sworn to serve above all else, and a minister's private interests. But what has happened here? Bligh Ventures has kept the computer bounty. As the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) put it so eloquently three weeks ago, it is the only Bligh that has kept its bounty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is just not good enough. There should be mutiny over the abolition of these bounties and the Prime Minister should be playing Fletcher Christian and setting adrift in a very small boat a minister whose shares in Bligh <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Ventures make him totally inappropriate to command the course of this nation's manufacturing industry.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Industry development is vital to the future of this nation. By that I do not just mean industry development across the broad parameter of policy development in this country but something which is clearly and specifically targeted to ensure that Australia can take proper advantage of those natural areas where we excel as a nation and also those areas where we need to ensure that the industries we have already supported are able to grow in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Industry development depends on a number of things. Apart from broad macro-economic policies, which must be tuned to sustain the nation's economy, we also need a degree of certainty, and certainty is one thing which this government is not delivering to industry. It is the absence of certainty more than anything else which will undermine the development of future industry policy in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Industry needs to know the ground rules on which it is able to work. Industry suffers sufficiently already from the vagaries of modern day economies, the uncertainties which plague any industrial enterprise in the 1990s. Those are part of the scene for any industry, for any business, for any government, and everyone takes some account of those. But, in doing this and planning your business for the future, you need to be able to know that you can rely on government, you can rely on the word of this parliament, to set the parameters for the future in law and to ensure that where, for example, in this case, bounties are paid by this parliament, by the government and the taxpayers of this nation for the production of certain goods those will continue in the terms which the legislation sets out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is something which this government has undermined in a very serious way in this current budget. To do so, I think, will have very detrimental effects on industry policy in Australia. It will also have very detrimental effects on employment growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have recently seen the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), particularly in question time, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6861"> lecture this parliament about how cutting the deficit, interest rate reductions&mdash;fiscal consolidation, as he is wont to call it; all of these things&mdash;will lead to a better economy for Australia, how reducing the budget deficit will ultimately help to bring down interest rates, therefore create a climate where industry and employment growth are more certain and more possible. He uses that as a basis for explaining why his government has withdrawn these bounties, why it has withdrawn R&amp;D tax concessions, why it has walked away from some of the parameters which this parliament has previously set in law and which business has taken as a given in its planning for the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that there may be some argument&mdash;and the opposition does not disagree&mdash;that we need to ensure that the budget is brought back to balance over a period of time. That is something which was very much part of our policy make&hyphen;up as well and the Acting Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans), the shadow Treasurer, has put this to the parliament on many occasions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what the Prime Minister ignores in his broad generalisations is the very specific effects that some of his policies will have on individual industries and on their ability to grow and generate jobs. The reality is that while there might be a defensible case in terms of broad macro-economic policy you have to look very closely at what your particular policies are doing in relation to individual industries to assess how those changes are going to impact on Australians and on their jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would put it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that decisions to withdraw bounties like these will be decisions which cut growth in this country, which cut exports from Australia and which ultimately cut jobs. That is where this legislation fails the Prime Minister's very own tests and where it fails the test which this parliament should ultimately set for this kind of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also retrospective legislation. It has a very unfortunate impact on regional centres&mdash;another area where the Prime Minister has previously touted this government's interest. It is a policy which I think regional Australia <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> should firmly reject, it is a policy which industry in this country should firmly reject, and it is certainly a policy which this opposition firmly rejects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bounty legislation, which covers a wide variety of industries&mdash;this is an omnibus bill&mdash;is withdrawing bounties in relation to ships, in relation to books, in relation to robots and machine tools and in relation to computers and associated equipment. Those are all areas in which Australia has been able to develop policies which have led to exports, to job growth and to wealth creation in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have also led to something a bit more intangible&mdash;innovation and the growth in innovation in this country. There is nothing more harmful to the growth of innovation, which of itself is, as I have said, more intangible but in the long run probably more important to our future wealth creation opportunities, than the removal of certainty, the removal of these incentives which people have seen put into place only to have them withdrawn without notice at a critical time in the development of this nation's industry policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have companies in Tasmania&mdash;Incat, for example, and Austal in Fremantle&mdash;that have undertaken very innovative work in the shipbuilding area only to find themselves now very much at a disadvantage when competing with their European colleagues who are able to put ships in the water with much more substantial subsidies from their own national governments than our companies are able to obtain from our government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, we are finding a situation with the ships capital grants legislation&mdash;now that that has been renewed because of the furore that broke around that&mdash;that in fact this government is able to find money for companies like BHP and Shell, et cetera, to buy their ships overseas but it is not able to find money to ensure that very innovative and progressive companies in this country are able to produce products in this nation for our benefit and the long-term growth of exports and jobs in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also particularly relevant, I think, to examine the impact of this on the regional <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6862"> economy. I have already indicated the impact it will have on the shipbuilding industry in the regional economies of Tasmania and Western Australia. The withdrawal of the books bounty will have a particular impact in Maryborough in Victoria, as my colleague who has just resumed his seat, the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson), has indicated. The withdrawal of the books bounty will have a very severe and damaging impact on that regional economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Adelaide, in my own home state, will also suffer from the withdrawal of the ships bounty and the books bounty. We have a number of innovative companies in Adelaide who are beginning to compete in the area of ship production and who have already made substantial inroads into exporting books. Griffin Press, for example, is an organisation that has a very substantial reputation in South Australia. They were in the newspapers recently with the management indicating their complete lack of satisfaction with the conduct of the Brown Liberal state government, who have declined to assist that company. Indeed, they have declined even to visit Griffin Press premises until early next year. This indicates the complete lack of interest which our local state government unfortunately has in assisting very substantial businesses, like Griffin Press, who have done a lot to improve the export opportunities in the publishing trade over recent years, as have many of their colleagues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One thing is common to all of these: we have seen substantial growth in industries like shipbuilding, book publishing and IT industries. We have seen substantial growth in these industries under the regime of bounties which were established over the course of the last decade. The sunrise industries&mdash;IT industries&mdash;have been able to flourish and grow while some of the more established ones&mdash;the shipbuilding industries and the publishing industries&mdash;have been able to sustain their position, recover ground from those overseas competitors who are undermining them and take their industry forward. In doing this, they take more than their industry forward; they take their region forward and take employment growth forward. It is employment <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> growth which I think is the underlying key to all of this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we turn our attention to the IT industry, which is a special interest of mine as shadow minister for science and information technology, we see that it is a very major potential industry for Australia. But there are a number of constraints we need to examine in relation to it. This bounty has been around since July 1994. It replaced a scheme based on the Automatic Data Processing Equipment Bounty Act 1977. This was due to continue until the year 2000. It has been extended by this government for an additional period, but that period certainly falls well short of the original year 2000 cut&hyphen;off date which this bounty was meant to enjoy and which, no doubt, many industries had planned on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Very substantial growth has occurred in the IT industries in recent years. Looking at some of the figures associated with that, IT industries and markets, through the framework of the IT industry map, reveals that 7,500 businesses were operating in the IT industry since June 1993. One hundred and eighty&hyphen;nine were in the communications services, 278 were in information equipment manufacturing and over 4,800 were in information services. A critical fact for this government is that more than 95 per cent of these businesses had fewer than 20 employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australian revenues from IT markets grew from less than $20 billion in 1990 to over $33 billion in 1995. In 1995, almost 46 per cent, over $15 billion by value, of this total revenue came from communications services; 31 per cent, just over $10 billion, from information equipment; 14 per cent, nearly $5 billion, from information services; and the remaining nine per cent, or nearly $3 billion, from software and content. This is a very massive and substantial industry&mdash;one which is primarily focused in many small businesses. As I said, more than 95 per cent of the businesses involved had fewer than 20 employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bounty would have cost the government less than $100 million over the next four years, but its withdrawal will have a counterproductive, countervailing impact on the industry way in excess of the revenue the government will save by discounting this <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6863"> bounty so much earlier than would otherwise have been the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia particularly needs to ensure that its IT industries are furthered. We have a very substantial deficit in this country in the import of hardware and software facilities. Australia is a very heavy user of IT equipment&mdash;one of the largest in the world, in fact. Unfortunately, most of it is imported. We make very little of it here. Unless we are able to address this deficit in IT equipment, Australia will be the worse for it as we head into next century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously the importance of IT, not only as an industry in Australia but as an aid to manufacturing, as an aid to finance and service industries, as an aid to the flow of information and the application of that around the country, will be severely undermined if Australia is not able to address the deficit in the information technology industries which we are rapidly accumulating at the present time. The withdrawal of this bounty sends entirely the wrong signals to the information technology industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Industry Commission recently examined this very bounty back in 1995. They did not recommend a renewal of this bounty at that time, but they took that decision in the context of all of the other arrangements which were in place to assist industry. For example, at the time they took that decision, the government was offering a 150 per cent tax concession in relation to research and development. Under legislation we will debate when the House resumes in just over a week's time, the government is proposing to reduce that concession from 150 per cent to 125 per cent&mdash;a very substantial change and one which was not taken into account by the Industry Commission when it made its report. Likewise, the massive reduction in grants under the EMDG and other AusIndustry initiatives, all of which were cut savagely in the last budget, were all there and put in place to ensure that industries like the IT industry were able to grow and prosper.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The combined effect of all of this government's decisions in the budget&mdash;the withdrawal of bounties, the withdrawal of tax concessions for research and development, the withdrawal of industry initiatives&mdash;will fail <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> completely the Prime Minister's test of: does it affect jobs and does it affect growth? Unfortunately, it certainly does and it affects us very adversely.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The parliamentary secretary at the table said we have just had this debate. I would not have mentioned, except for his interjection, that the minister responsible, the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan), has just left the chamber. Given that she was aware I was going to speak about child care, perhaps the minister will come back at 6 o'clock to respond to the points we are making. We live in hope.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In many ways we do not hold the Minister for Family Services responsible. We would have hoped that in the Expenditure Review Committee she would have tried to defend community child-care centres across the country against these cutbacks. We can only try to give her the benefit of the doubt and suspect that she might have fought against these cuts but, unfortunately, whatever position she took in the ERC, the facts of life are that child care in Australia has been cut as a result of the decisions of the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to turn first of all to the government's decision to remove operational subsidies from community child-care centres. In my own electorate, community child&hyphen;care centres are run by the local councils on the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6864"> central coast. They receive a subsidy from the federal government to help low income earners afford child care. Most central coast community child-care centres cater for nought&hyphen; to two&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds, which is the most expensive group to provide quality child care for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Community based child&hyphen;care centres in my electorate include those at Bay Village, Gorokan Care and Learning, the Spotted Gum Child Care Centre, Tom Stone Child Care, Watanobbi, Kanwal Care and Learning, Tyrell Place at Bateau Bay and also Karinya Child Care in East Toukley, which I had the honour of opening a few years ago. This is now within the electorate of the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris). The centre is also providing quality child care to people who live in my electorate. There are about 600 young kids receiving quality child care in these centres. It is those children who will be the hardest hit by this government's decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Wyong Council, which operates these centres, estimates that the government's decision to remove the subsidies will add another $20 to $25 a week to child care or $80 to $100 a month per child for each parent. Many parents in Wyong, Lake Haven, Gorokan and Bateau Bay just will not be able to afford  this. They will be forced to leave full&hyphen;time work to stay home with their kids or trust their children to ad hoc child care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the ironies is that, as a result of this decision, the new Kanwal Care and Learning Centre, which the subsidies of the former federal Labor government helped fund in January 1996, will now be struggling to survive without having to charge those high fees which some parents will simply be unable to afford. They will have to question whether they will be able to send their children to this new centre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now turn to the second issue, that is, the government's decision to cut child&hyphen;care assistance to a maximum of 50 hours per week for all parents. I know that the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), like myself, has many parents who have to spend many hours each day travelling to and from work. These will be the parents who will be <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> hardest hit by the decision to impose this new limit of 50 hours per week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's decision, of course, is another broken election promise, not just to the parents on the central coast of New South Wales but right around Australia. They said that a Liberal-National Party government would maintain the system of child-care assistance. But, in fact, what they have done is hurt those parents on the New South Wales central coast. Fifty per cent of parents work outside the region, usually in Sydney. These parents face an eight&hyphen;hour working day and two to four hours of travelling. It will be their children who will be the hardest hit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would particularly like to mention the Spotted Frog Kindergarten in Gorokan, which provides 39 places for three&hyphen; to six&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds in long day care. Most children are from two income families where parents work outside the area and rely on long day care to be able to work in Sydney. These parents, whose incomes are not high, will be hit by the limit on hours and the means testing of child-care assistance. Many of these parents have recently presented me with a petition from 149 families opposed to the government's heartless child&hyphen;care cuts. This is along with hundreds of other people in my electorate who have asked me to express the strong opposition of central coast residents to this government's cutbacks. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to speak about the RSL and Remembrance Day, which is next Monday. This is a time when we as a nation can pay tribute and homage to those who gave their lives so that we may be able to live in a free and open society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Returned Services League, the organisation which I am sure all members of this place would know, was formed especially to service those men and women who served Australia in the defence forces. In 1985 it changed so it could include those service personnel currently serving in the Australian defence forces. The RSL mission statement says: </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6865">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To ensure programs are in place for the well being, care, compensation and commemoration of serving and ex&hyphen;service Defence Force members and their dependants; and promote government and community awareness of the need for a secure, stable and progressive Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>The RSL evolved as a direct result of the camaraderie, concern and mateship shown by the diggers for the welfare of their mates during, at the cessation of and after the 1914&hyphen;18 war. That ethos of compassion and service remains the motivating influence of the league.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was only last month that the RSL celebrated its 80th anniversary. The league had its first meeting in Melbourne 80 years ago in 1916, just 17 months after the Gallipoli landing. Rather than becoming a political party, it decided to become a pressure group. The RSL has taken on many issues as a result since then.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One recent example is the Black Hawk tragedy. Two of the soldiers that died in that tragedy were from my electorate. Two other SAS soldiers involved in that tragedy were associated with my children's school and one was, in fact, teaching my son to kick a footy in my absence. I know how the RSL feels about this particular issue. In fact, the president is advocating that the Black Hawk victims and serving personnel involved in training be eligible for cover under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. The campaign for these families continues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The league takes up many other issues for its members. There are around 232,000 members of the RSL nationwide. The president, in a recent interview in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>, said that, while the RSL holds basic values, the league is capable of great change. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The name changes over the years reflect that&mdash;from Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia to Returned Servicemen's League to Returned and Services League. They reflect deeper changes to meet the contemporary times, which is as it should be.</PARA>
<PARA>In Western Australia, the league is very active indeed. I have many constituents for whom the RSL is very prominent in their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last few years, we have heard a lot about the reconciliation with our indigenous <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people in this country, and the RSL has also been part of this process. In fact, Mr Jack Babbage, who is chair of the Western Australian state branch of the membership committee, seeks to encourage eligible Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander veterans and ex-service members to join the RSL.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were many Australians who fought in wars this century. Many of these Australians were, in fact, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. They should be strongly encouraged to join the RSL, and they should also be encouraged to join the Australian defence forces, as should any Australian who wants to join.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I raised this issue with the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop) a few weeks ago, when I asked what initiatives the government was taking to encourage Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders to join the ADF. To achieve increased recruitment of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people into the Australian Defence Force, the minister said that the ADF had initiated, firstly, the production of a video segment for indigenous people's TV programs featuring indigenous people in the ADF today; secondly, the identification of indigenous personnel in the ADF who can be used as role models and used actively in marketing; thirdly, a review of brochures and posters to ensure that Australia's ethnic groups are included in the images of ADF members; fourthly, identification of suitable indigenous ADF personnel to feature in recruiting duties; fifthly, the inclusion of cultural awareness and recruitment courses; and, sixthly, the establishment of a support group to improve the likelihood of training completion and retention of indigenous members in the ADF.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So these initiatives to encourage Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders to join the RSL and the ADF reflect an adaptable organisation in changing times. I fully support the RSL moves to encourage returned and current service Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders to join. I am sure the other members of this place will have a similar view. Next Monday is Remembrance Day. Let us use that day to remember and reflect that Australia is indeed <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6866"> a lucky country and a peaceful country, and we should never take that for granted.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to draw attention to the loss of the LEAP and REEP labour market programs, which has already impacted heavily on landcare and local government environment programs. There is no doubt the green corps, provided for in the budget, will not be able to replace LEAP. The DEETYA paper `Questions and Answers, Budget 1996' states that green corps will have 240 places in 1996-97, 1,260 in 1997-98 and 2,000 in 1998-99. This is an extremely low number, given the size of the environmental problem and considering these figures are Australia&hyphen;wide.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The organisation to be appointed to conduct green corps has to be a national one. This means it might have no existing regional structure, commitment or support. I believe local community involvement in the environment is the only way we are going to deliver outcomes, and LEAP in the Calare electorate has certainly delivered that. Across this region, 29 landcare and rivercare groups, nine local government councils and 40 community groups have been assisted in projects such as fencing remnant vegetation and tree planting in Capertee Valley; water management and native vegetation restoration, improving farm productivity and creating wildlife habitat at East Saltram Creek, near Bathurst; major wetlands work at Lake Pilans, Lithgow, to rehabilitate a section of Cox's River catchment, and hence Sydney's water supply; and biodiversity studies and platypus surveys in association with Charles Sturt University.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If green corps is to be as small as proposed, its impact will be minimal, and in regional terms negligible, compared with the achievements of LEAP in the central west. If green corps does not have a regional and local infrastructure, any flexibility and responsiveness to local needs, as demonstrated in its effectiveness to date, will be lost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had submissions from Landcare, the farmers association, councils, the Central West Community College and the general public on the short&hyphen;sightedness of axing <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> LEAP. They are at the coalface of what Landcare and StreamWatch should be all about. LEAP participants have developed a sense of belonging to a project because that project belonged to their patch of dirt. I have said before&mdash;in my first speech in this place, in fact&mdash;that LEAP not only should be locally based and generated, but should be long term&mdash;two days a week for three years perhaps&mdash;so that sense of belonging and ownership can last from commencement to fruition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As one former provider of LEAP programs has told me:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because they are locally based they give young people in rural areas an opportunity to develop skills and new directions, explore options and prepare to leave their home bases where necessary for employment while still contributing constructively to their local community.</PARA>
<PARA>The providers of the former LEAP programs are already geared up to deliver environmental programs. They have tools and equipment&mdash;in one case, five minibuses and trailers. There will not be enough green corps participants in all to fill three minibuses&mdash;based on the figures I have seen&mdash;west of the mountains let alone in the central west. I said in response to the appropriation bill that the green corps is a great concept, but it needs to be greatly expanded beyond a warm and fuzzy concept into a development from LEAP&mdash;locally administered and locally driven with relevant local outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a real danger that, by tendering out the green corps program to a national provider, the locally specific needs of landcare and environmental management will be lost. There is a real concern in my electorate that the excellent work begun by LEAP, under the guidance of local labour market providers, will be lost unless green corps is greatly increased in numbers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said in my speech during the heritage trust debate that the Murray-Darling 2001 project is in reality a 3001 project&mdash;so huge are the problems in that basin alone. LEAP played a significant role in beginning to rectify those problems, which green corps, as planned, certainly will not unless it is greatly expanded and, importantly, localised.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last Saturday, along with 45 to 50 other members around Australia, I participated in the Road Transport Forum's Drive for Safety Awareness Week. In my case, that involved driving in a Mack truck, a B&hyphen;double in my case, from Dubbo saleyards into the civic centre building on the edge of the CBD. This particular truck was owned by Walkers Transport and I was accompanied by Gary Walker.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I congratulate the Road Transport Drivers Association for being involved in such a worthy project. You certainly get a different perspective of road safety from high up in the cabin of one of these trucks compared with being in a car. You become more conscious of things like turning circles, stopping distances and the courtesy and consideration which is sometimes lacking in the car drivers that you meet on the way. In fact, 70 per cent of crashes that involve large vehicles are actually the fault of the other road user.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trucking industry, which I want to address, provides 1.7 per cent of the jobs in this country. They shift $60 billion worth of freight across Australia every year, which is 75 per cent of all our freight. The fact is that we could not survive as a nation without trucking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to look at the economics of it. The truck that I was in, the Mack Prime Mover, cost $220,000 and the two trailers of the B-double cost $180,000&mdash;$400,000 in total. When you add the cost of registration, maintenance, fuel, insurance and wages of the drivers, et cetera, you can see that, as an absolute minimum, you have to gross $1,000 a day just to recover your costs. To run the truck at $3.20 a kilometre, you have to be doing over 300 kilometres a day every day of the year, or in excess of 115,000 kilometres a year. To make a profit you have to be driving the truck over 200,000 kilometres a year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. The table shows quite clearly that two B-doubles on the road, which cart 1,320 sheep, is equivalent to three single-deck trucks, which also cart 1,320 sheep. By putting two B&hyphen;double trucks on the road instead of three single&hyphen;deckers, you will get one truck off the road and save about seven metres in length of trucking. So it is an actual advantage to road safety as well as being more economic.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Looking at it another way, if you put three road trains on the road, which is equivalent to six single-deck trucks, you actually get three single-deck trucks off the road. Or if you had 15 single-deck drivers in your company and you replace those 15 single-deck trucks with 10 B-doubles, it would mean a reduction of five drivers and you would end up with 10 better drivers, on average, than the 15 drivers that were on the road.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is cheaper, you get a better quality of driver and you have fewer trucks on the road. These bigger trucks are nearly all equipped with air cushions instead of steel springs, which are softer and less jarring on the road pavement. It is better for the truck and better for the road. Because of air cushions, you can load them up another 1&half;, two or three tonnes per axle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to also acknowledge the need to upgrade the Newell Highway between Dubbo and Gilgandra. There are three bridges there and some other sections of road that need widening so that we can accommodate B-doubles and road trains on that section of the road. If stock is coming into Dubbo from the north, they have to divert through Trangie, which is an extra 100 kilometres to travel. At <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> $3.20 a kilometre, you can see that that adds about 50c per sheep to the freight costs of sheep that land at Fletcher's abattoir in Dubbo. That is eventually deducted from the producer at the other end. This highlights how vital good and adequate roads are not only to safety but also to the economics of the  industry in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year 2,017 people died on the road. We have to aim to get that down to under 1,900 in the future. Alcohol is a factor in 30 per cent of fatal crashes, speed in 25 per cent and fatigue in six per cent. Young people make up 15 per cent of the population and 30 per cent of those killed&mdash;and 25 per cent of those killed did not wear seat belts.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to use this time tonight to make an appeal to the government to come clean with the nation and admit that the Council of Australian Government process that it is engaged in is a failure. This government is driven by a ruthless and inflexible ideology that the best government is no government, that the best regulation is no regulation. This government blew its trumpet loudly about transferring everything to the states when it came into government. Now we see from the papers going to COAG next week that this process has been totally stalled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is time for the government to admit that the states, even the most conservative, do not want a bar of this poisoned chalice. They <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have gradually come to the realisation that what this government really means when it says `reform' is `make do with less' or `funding cuts'. This government has tried to con the states and the Australian people into thinking that its proposed devolution of Commonwealth services to the states would mean greater efficiency and improved service delivery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first clue to their real agenda was provided by the National Commission of Audit which said that any devolution of services should be parcelled up with an across-the-board funding cut of 10 per cent&mdash;this, of course, in the guise of an efficiency dividend. In other words, the states would have their budgets cut.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In public housing, this government has decided to abandon a policy that has operated since World War II in favour of a leap into the unknown. This government, it seems, will be leaping into the unknown alone because the states are increasingly coming to the view that the government has no idea of how it intends to effect its changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor certainly accepted the need that the Commonwealth-state housing agreement needed to change. This government is planning to take us in the direction of increasing reliance on market forces to provide housing stock and rental assistance as the only means of accessing housing&mdash;a policy tried with disastrous consequences in the UK and the US. This is a direction that Labor and the state governments of all political persuasions are refusing to follow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A similar rejection has been registered with the government's plans to devolve aged care to the states. Since these plans were first mooted by the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge), I have had meetings all around the states, both with providers and consumers. In all these meetings, those providers and consumers have made clear their very grave concerns with the government's plans of devolution to the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposals that the government is making as part of the COAG process involve fundamental changes but at this stage are incredibly light on detail. I want to tell the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6869"> House about some statements in the issues paper on aged care that is going to COAG next week. It is interesting to note that, since this paper was first drafted, it now contains a very important disclaimer. It says that the release of this paper:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . does not, however, imply any commitment to transfer of aged care responsibilities. Such a commitment could only occur after further consideration by Ministers in early 1997, including consideration of the outcomes of discussion in response to this paper. Agreement would also need to be reached on approaches to ensuring improved outcomes for people and the adequacy of funding for aged care now and into the future.</PARA>
<PARA>A little later in the paper it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Its release does not, however, imply any commitment to transfer of aged care responsibilities&mdash;such a commitment could only occur after further consideration . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This is yet further delay on consideration of very important issues. This issue is being delayed further and further. As it says at the end of the paper, submissions on this paper are now not due until the end of February next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is afraid to govern and is using the COAG process simply as a means of avoiding making decisions. I repeat my plea to the government: admit that the COAG process will not work. Take responsibility for aged care. Do not keep up the farce that this important Commonwealth policy should be sent to the states. It should not be. Aged care is far too important to be sent away to six different places to be cared for. This government cannot deliver. The farce that is going on at COAG should stop now.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

Doctors in Albania did not have the technology to diagnose, let alone treat, Eddie's condition. The bottom line was that Eddie was in great trouble. </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In June this year Eddie's aunt, Mrs Hana Hysen,  contacted my office to see what I could do for Eddie. We immediately organised a fundraising campaign amongst the Lilley residents and organisations to give Eddie a chance at life. Dr Dorothy Radford of the Prince Charles Hospital offered to diagnose Eddie's condition and do any subsequent operations free of charge so long as money was raised to cover the cost of the hospital. The ballpark figure at that stage was $4,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Northside Chronicle</EMPHASIS>, a Quest community newspaper, must be applauded for the professional and caring manner in which they published Eddie's plight. I would like to thank  personally the journalist, Michael Crutcher, for his personal involvement. I believe he is now known amongst his peers as `the Eddie correspondent'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The response to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Northside Chronicle </EMPHASIS>front page story on Eddie was phenomenal. Cash and cheques just flowed into the office for weeks. Many of the donations were anonymous. There were two individual donations which stick in my mind. The first was from a lady who wrote a cheque for $500. When my staff inquired why the generosity of the donation, she replied, `When I was five I needed a heart operation and the community rallied around me. Now its payback time.' Another  donation that warmed my heart was from an elderly man who walked into the office and handed in a bagful of coins and said, `The boy needs this more than I do.' The bag of coins totalled $37.50.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second phase of the `Save Eddie Campaign' came in the support of local schools. Clayfield College and Boondall State School both held plain clothes days to raise money for the appeal. The Heart Foundation organised a jump rope demonstration at the Toombul shopping centre and the Brisbane North Chamber of Commerce did a whip&hyphen; round at one of their breakfast functions. The Albanian community provided considerable support and finances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After reading about Eddie's plight, the Islamic mosque at Lutwyche also gave a large donation. In the end, we managed to raise the healthy sum of just over $5,000. We did, however, encounter some problems. We <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6870"> approached airlines to sponsor Eddie and his father on the trip to Australia. Unfortunately, this was not able to be fixed up and Kedron Wavell Services Club had to come to the rescue and pick up the cost of the airfares. This was after they had already made a sizeable donation to the appeal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Eddie arrived in Australia at the end of August and was met by a large contingent at the airport. An hour after the plane had landed and we still had not seen Eddie, we began to think they may have missed the connection in Singapore. However, it turned out that Eddie was very excitable and while his dad waited in line at customs and immigration, he kept running off. As a result, dad had to chase him and kept losing his place in the queue. However, they finally came through customs and the joy on the faces of family and friends was well worth the effort of the fundraising.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In such an exercise, unforeseen circumstances were bound to crop up. After his first visit to the doctor, Eddie had to have his badly decayed baby teeth removed because of the risk of infection. We are thankful that the fundraising efforts had been such a success that we were able to accommodate this additional expense. Eddie was diagnosed with a hole in the heart and a twisted aorta. But the good news is that Eddie had a 95 per cent chance of surviving surgery. That is 95 per cent better than if he had stayed in Albania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Eddie had his heart operation on 29 October. The electorate of Lilley is happy that all went well and he will be back at his aunt's home this week. I am proud of the residents of Lilley who contributed so generously to Eddie's appeal. It is heartening to know that as a community we have made a difference in Eddie's life. I am proud to represent such a wonderful and caring electorate.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I stand quite alarmed. The Howard and Carnell governments in the ACT have done something really wrong and they have got it wrong. Today's ABS unemployment figures give us an 8.5 per cent trend unemployment rate and youth unemployment sitting at 53.5 <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> per cent.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The economy in the ACT is suffering unbelievably under the two levels of conservative government in the ACT. When I look at a youth unemployment rate today of 53.5 per cent in the ACT, I ask the question: what future do our school leavers have to look forward to in the next month or two with the sorts of policies that are currently under way? The private sector is retracting as fast as the public sector is, for obvious reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I implore both levels of government to look seriously at the policies they have in place because the effect on the ACT and on my electorate is dramatic to the point that there is absolutely no economic future to look forward to.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Wool International Amendment Bill 1996 will replace the current terms of the fixed disposal schedule of the wool stockpile with more flexible provisions. The new disposal schedule allows for a minimum of 135,000 bales per quarter for the period of January to June next year, decreasing further to a minimum disposal of 90,000 bales per quarter from July 1997. The maximum of 135,000 bales per quarter applies until the stockpile is sold and delivered. The end date for sale and delivery is set at 31 December in the year 2000. The retirement of the debt will result in the removal of the government's debt guarantee arrangements at the target date, which is December 1998. The amendments also provide for an additional objective for Wool International, requiring it to have regard to the effect of the disposal of the stockpile on the market for wool, which encompasses both fresh wool and stockpile wool.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As most of us know, the background to this is that the fixed schedule regime for the disposal of the wool stockpile was put in place by the Labor government in 1994. It has been effective, and the stockpile and the debt are both now at a level which is less than half of that which built up in the early 1990s. It is because of this success that Wool International, as the stockpile manager, is now able to operate under a more commercially flexible disposal regime. These amendments will provide Wool International with that commercial flexibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been extensive debate within the industry about the need to move on from the fixed schedule regime, and these amendments are the result of that debate, which has involved both the new government and the opposition. The industry has actually asked that these amendments be passed to allow the new regime to commence operating from January next year, and we support that request and we are happy to recommend that the bill be passed as a matter of urgency.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the opposition spokesman, the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe), for the opposition's cooperation in the expedition of the Wool International Amendment Bill 1996 in changing the schedule. I appreciate his sentiments and also those of the shadow minister, and I place my appreciation on record. This whole debate goes back to the demise of the reserve price scheme. Yet again, we have an argument here in the parliament about the stockpile and about the future of the wool industry. I recognise that present in the gallery are representatives of the Wool Council of Australia, and I know how much effort they have put into some of the recommendations before the parliament today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the record, the arrangements that are now in place go back to the Garnaut report and the recommendations that Professor Garnaut put forward in the hope that, as the `least worst' option&mdash;there was a lot of debate&mdash;the fixed release schedule would be a way in which we could reduce the stockpile and reduce the debt associated with it. After a lot of soul&hyphen;searching <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6873"> within the wool industry, it was agreed by this parliament and the wool growers that this option be undertaken in an endeavour to reduce the debt that was guaranteed by the government; and, of course, that the stockpile of 4.7 million bales be reduced to more commercial and acceptable levels. In 1991, we had a stockpile of 4.7 million bales with an associated debt of $2.8 billion, which was a debt that the wool growers had accumulated during the operation of the reserve price scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would hope, after all this debate, going back to the formation of the reserve price scheme in 1972&hyphen;73 and the debates wool growers undertook during those years, that future generations of wool growers will not be attracted to these types of schemes, hoping they can even out the fluctuations of wool prices, even in the current downturn of the industry. The figures, the exposure and the experience of wool growers during the last two decades of the reserve buffer stocks&mdash;whatever you might like to call the final reserve price scheme&mdash;have clearly indicated the fallacy of trying to manipulate an international commodity price, even though Australia was a major producer of the commodity fibre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have reached the end of that saga of debates within this parliament about reserve price, about escalating debt and now about a dramatic decline of the profitability of the wool industry. We have a situation with the fixed release schedule which, it is my view, has worked remarkably well. With 2.1 million bales in the stockpile and approximately $1 billion of debt owing and guaranteed by the government, the problem is now within manageable levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposition before the parliament is that 187,000 bales per quarter under the fixed release schedule had to be sold, and that has been executed. There has been some controversy about the way in which that was done, which I will refer to later. The proposition under this bill is that from January to June 1997 the release will be reduced to 135,000 bales per quarter, then from June 1997 onwards it will be a minimum of 90,000 bales per quarter. The stockpile, as I understand it, will be reduced by 31 December 2000 and, hopefully, the debt will be in hand by the end of 1998.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a lot of debate about the fixed release schedule within the wool industry. I would like to make some observations on this whole argument that members of the wool industry have been participating in, off and on, since 1991 when the reserve price scheme failed so dramatically. As I see it now, the problem facing the wool industry is the lack of demand for textiles throughout the world. Wool is part of the textile chain and demand has fallen dramatically in the importing countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In China, we see the demand, as best we can estimate it, falling 11 per cent. In Japan, our major importing country, there has been a 47 per cent fall in the demand for woollen products, and in Korea and Taiwan a fall of 26 per cent. These figures are as of March this year, but they reflect the overall position of the wool industry; that it was demand in the consumer countries for both wool and other textiles that was the major factor in the lack of improvement in the wool price and, in many cases, the gradual decline of the price over the last 18 months or so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also see stocks being moved from the Soviet Republic to China, and large stocks of wool in Europe. All these factors have ensured that wool prices to growers did not move up. So, in my view, it was the lack of demand for the product that brought about this very low price for wool growers throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the other hand, we have the interesting situation of having the lowest supply we have had for many decades. We have got the lowest sheep population, probably in the range of 115 <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6874"> million to maybe 120 million sheep, whereas at the peak of our production we had 180 million sheep in Australia. The clip at the peak of those sheep numbers, in 1989&hyphen;90, was in the range of 1.1 million tonnes. In the current production year, it is down to 640,000 tonnes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will not go into some of the peripheral arguments in this debate. As the Wool Council would be well aware, some wool growers get very involved in fine arguments about the selling system and the lack of demand in the auction system. It is quite clear that the key element, on the one hand, is the lack of demand across the board for all kinds of textiles&mdash;wool, synthetic fibre, cotton&mdash;and, on the other hand, the supply from Australia, the major producer, being at a very low level because of drought, lack of profitability and lack of sheep numbers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other interesting feature is the size of the unofficial stockpile in the stockbrokers' warehouses and in shearing sheds. Various estimates put it between 500,000 and 700,000 bales, although nobody is sure exactly what the unofficial stockpile might be. My understanding, from talking to people in the industry, is that the unofficial stockpile has been reduced in recent times and that growers are selling the wool because they cannot hang on any longer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the argument about the fixed release schedule and the changes that have been brought to this parliament, could I express my disappointment that some elements in the wool industry, particularly the stud merino breeders who have shown very little interest in past debates, have suddenly moved around Australia and arranged a number of meetings where they have said that the current system was no good and that we needed a change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I challenged a few of them, they had no suggestion as to what their alternative might be. They said only that the current arrangements were not good enough, that the propositions I have put before the House are not valid and that we must change something. They had no arguments but certainly they gained some political support, based on the fact that the wool industry was unprofitable and in very difficult conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The debate about the fixed release schedule, as it is now operating amongst wool growers, processors and exporters, was that in the efforts of Wool International to meet the demands of this parliament to sell the 187,000 bales per quarter, it had to resort to future private treaties, the sales had to be quite clear to the marketplace and it had to meet the sale of 187,000 bales per quarter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was agreed to after a lot of debate, after the release of the Garnaut report. They met the clearance objectives. Obviously, some of the future sales by private treaty did cause some consternation amongst some quite well-known wool growers who felt that the method of sale had an undue influence on price. I concede that on occasions the selling of wool through the futures, not through the auction system on a particular day, may have had an influence on price. On the other hand, there is some interesting evidence to indicate that, given the problem of the stockpile and the failure of the reserve price, this was an agreed approach and that we should continue to sell under this regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the wool had accumulated and the deadlines for selling the 187,000 bales per quarter had not been met, obviously there would be a selling process at the end of that quarter which would produce undue influences on the market. It was a bit difficult to win that argument amongst some wool growers, but it obviously would have happened unless the International Wool Secretariat had undertaken a future sales strategy to make sure that they met those objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note that, as I understand it, about 60 per cent of the wool currently sold is sold at auction and the use of the futures option is not encouraged in the wool industry. That <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6875"> came about because of the general operation of the reserve price scheme, where a fixed price was received and wool growers and wool processors knew exactly what was going to happen. There has not been a culture of using the futures operation whereas, I understand, in the cotton industry, futures are very much an integral part of their operation, which does help to even out the fluctuations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other problem of the fixed release schedule is that it is easy enough to sell the 187,000 bales in a rising market, but much more difficult in the current circumstances where the market is flat or, in fact, declining. A number of critics have come out of the woodwork to put their point of view about the actual change in methodology and how we should adjust the selling system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As always in this wool debate, time is short. I just put on the record that this is one of Australia's major export industries and whenever we have debated these matters in the House, as the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) would recall, we always seem to be restrained in terms of debate. I note that with some concern. I hope there are not too many more of these major debates; my hope would be that the wool industry becomes a private sector commercial operation without the interference of governments, reserve price schemes and members of parliament, and that changes to the wool industry are brought about. That would be my hope by 2000; I hope that we will not be having these debates in parliament and the wool industry will be running their own affairs without legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(10.16 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commend this bill and its intention to give Wool International greater commercial flexibility to dispose of the remaining stockpile in a more efficient manner. I am sure it will be supported by most people in regional and rural Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has already spoken about the enormous damage caused in regional areas by depressed wool prices over the past six years. Calare has been one of those areas hardest hit, with many farmers in the tablelands region of New South Wales relying solely on wool for their incomes. The flow&hyphen;on effects have obviously taken their toll on regional businesses, adding to the depression in local economies already hit hard by federal and state government cutbacks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While older people in our prime wool growing regions look back with great fondness to the 1950s when wool was a pound a pound and life was prosperous, I fear that in future many will look back with great sadness at the terribly depressing period rural Australia has just been through. I emphasise `been through' because I hope the painful period the industry has experienced is now behind us and that this bill marks the beginning of the way back. But there are several clouds on the horizon that I will outline later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister, Mr Anderson, has already outlined how important the ongoing promotion of wool is to ensure it becomes an attractive product to young consumers. It is fair to say that the bush is full of people who are critical of the International Wool Secretariat&mdash;people who do not believe wool is being promoted in the right way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, the minister quoted statistics showing that five or six years ago the under&hyphen;35s shunned buying wool because it was seen as undesirable. Today, that resistance age level has climbed to 40. These figures show that the promotion has not been working. But I would like to think that many of the marketing initiatives that we have seen over the past 12 to 18 months have yet to take effect. Many people will have seen the latest TV and cinema commercials showing around the world, promoting the woolmark and helping to give the product a younger and, might I say, a sexier image.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6876">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even more importantly, in the past year we have seen the development of exciting new products: a wool&hyphen;lycra blend developed in conjunction with the synthetic giant, Dupont; and sportswool has the potential to ensure wool grabs a major slice of the leisure wear market. In the past month, we have even seen the Levi jeans company develop woollen jeans. All these very recent initiatives will, hopefully, ensure wool captures a slice of the youth and leisure market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us face it, in the days when Australia rode on the sheep's back, every respectable rural gentleman had a few Fletcher Jones jackets in the wardrobe, along with some woollen pants and ties, while ladies had several smart woollen skirts and dresses. Times have changed. Today, for more and more average Australians, trackie pants and T&hyphen;shirts are the order of the day. Even at this year's national merino show and sale in Dubbo, the local newspaper pointed out that most industry people present were wearing cotton and synthetics, not wool.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my own electorate of Calare, we see many instances of those in the wool industry not sitting back and waiting for the world to beat a path to their door, but actually taking up the initiative to help themselves. The dismantling of the floor price scheme and collapse in wool prices made wool growers across Australia realise their product is not just another standard price commodity, like wheat or coal, but a high quality, specialised fibre. Indeed, quality has increasingly become a buzz word in the industry, with growers implementing total quality management schemes to ensure the highest possible quality fibre from the sheep's back right through every stage of production to the consumer. Many growers have also embarked on their own specialist marketing schemes, creating a niche market for their product.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One example in my own electorate is an enterprising group of 14 fine&hyphen;wool producers in the Bathurst district, who have set up a company called Tablelands Wool. Back in 1993, after suffering two years of depressed prices, they decided that simply producing wool and sending it off to auction was not good enough. Like many farmers on the tablelands, some of the members of this group relied solely on wool for their income. You can imagine how shattered they must have felt. They knew that after generations of sheep breeding they were producing the best fleece in the world; yet, at that time, all they could get for it was 450c per kilo. They decided to process and spin their own wool, at the same time designing and knitting a range of stunning knitwear, and engaging a designer in New York, in fact, to ensure that they catered to North American taste. Tablelands Wool is now selling more than 2,000 jumpers and skirts annually, both here and in North America. It is now working on a joint venture selling classic winter socks, both in Australia and New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another amazing self&hyphen;help initiative in my electorate is one I have had the pleasure of witnessing at first&hyphen;hand in recent weeks: the development of a new woollen blanket for hospital beds. Manildra farmer David Hamilton can remember the days prior to 1965 when all hospitals in Australia used woollen blankets. They were discontinued because of their cost and because of some concerns over some possible disease factors that turned out not to be true; but, by the time that had happened, cotton blankets had taken over. The fact that they could not stand up to modern laundry methods was another concern. The Australian wool industry thereby lost one of its major customers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Hamilton suggested that the CSIRO work to overcome this 30&hyphen;year&hyphen;old problem and now, after four years of research, the first successful trial wash of a new woollen hospital blanket took place at the Central West Linen Service laundry in Orange, three weeks ago. I was happy to attend and witness the trial, and I am pleased to say it was a success. In fact, indications <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6877"> are that the new wool blankets will last three times as long as the cotton ones currently in use in our hospitals. Considering that a major hospital like Westmead in Sydney has 20,000 blankets in stock, the potential of this development is enormous, and I give full credit to David Hamilton.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one anomaly in the wool disposal system that impacts on superfine producers and that needs drawing attention to. Superfine wool growers contributed approximately 16 per cent of the money to the stockpile funds, although they represented only four per cent of growers at the close of the stockpile. They feel they have been required to support the stockpile all along. However, for the past two years, there has been no superfine wool in the stockpile, but the producers paid 4.5 per cent tax all the same.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the industry's crippling stockpile debt is now back to manageable proportions&mdash;now less than $1 billion&mdash;there is still a long way to go. I agree totally with the President of the Wool Council of Australia, who said recently that the industry for too long has been preoccupied with supply side issues. He rightly says that, for the industry to achieve a sustainable recovery, much more attention needs to be focused on improving the global demand for wool. There have been calls for at least $70 million per year more for promotion efforts under the generic Woolmark label, to be raised by either continuing the levy or moving to an export tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe there is room for more joint venture initiatives overseas to help Eastern Europe, for instance, re&hyphen;establish its production capabilities. I spoke with one leading Chinese official late last year who suggested that Australia could perhaps be doing more to help that country on a joint venture basis to improve its wool processing. Perhaps there are some tariff issues we should discuss before we get into that but, obviously, it suggests that there are avenues that will help meet the demand for an economically priced product in that country. I note the reference of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) to recent arrangements with Mexico to export wool tops to be value added there and re&hyphen;exported as finished garments into North America, under NAFTA on a tariff&hyphen;free basis. That is smart marketing, and it is the sort of marketing that will be required. I also note moves, again in my own electorate, to value add to create high quality material for the North American market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These positive developments notwithstanding, there is one serious problem facing the wool industry&mdash;in my electorate and, I suspect, more broadly across Australia&mdash;that has the potential to cripple the fine&hyphen;wool industry and appears to be receiving scant attention from government. That is the threat to the industry from ovine johnes disease. The extent of it is unknown. It is believed that it came into Australia in the late 1970s via carpet wool sheep from New Zealand. That raises some real concerns about the ability of AQIS to look at other issues that may impact on some of our other agricultural industries, about which Mr Campbell has said a lot. I totally endorse his private member's bill on holding people responsible, should we have to close the gate after the horse has bolted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of the seriousness of the johne's situation in my electorate, I have been forced to help create a support network. I have endeavoured to find the extent of the problem. I have got a survey going out in the electorate at the moment, and beyond the electorate, into the Mudgee area and beyond, to find out the extent of the johne's problem. Several studs have already been commercially crippled by their johne's status. There is one stud of three generations which is now virtually unable to do anything with its stock except cut the wool off it and sell the stock for mutton at vastly reduced prices.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6878">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One Mudgee producer told me the other day that he bought rams from a quarantined stud in 1989 and, with no testing of his stock, he has now been placed under a similar quarantine. At the end of the day, two years down the track after the current task force program has undertaken to try and look at the problem, he may come out of it as clean as a whistle, but with that suspicion over him he is commercially devastated at the moment. His lucrative commercial market for wethers is now a loss situation as he tries to sell his cast&hyphen;offs as mutton. I also suspect that johne's could have an impact on our mutton exports. We should be very wary that, if there is any suspicion of a link between johne's and any possible human contamination, there is a real risk that we may find another market threatened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that these people need urgent exceptional circumstance assistance on an ongoing basis while the task force conducts its two&hyphen;year study into this. I am also in the throes of seeking a specialist counsellor because there are people who are close to being suicidal over the impact that this disease has had on their enterprises. It has the potential to devastate our merino industry if we do not attack it very soon as a matter of national importance.</PARA></SPEECH>

<ELECTORATE> (O'Connor)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(10.28 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Wool International Amendment Bill 1996 is a very important piece of legislation for one of Australia's great industries, one that I might add is under very considerable pressure, and one in which I think some people have not realised the ongoing effects that occur when we see such a decline in the profitability of the wool industry, particularly where it affects specialist growers who become totally unviable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also another effect which is becoming noticeable in an electorate such as O'Connor, where you have a very substantial mixed farming operation and within that mixed farming each part lives off the other. It is often forgotten that proper rotational aspects of grain growing require a grazing industry and an industry where we rely on those leguminous pastures to reinvigorate the soil during that process. What is happening at the moment is that, due to quite good grain prices and disastrous wool prices, we are seeing wall&hyphen;to&hyphen;wall grain growing and a consequent decline in the protein levels of the grain produced. What has always been a problem in my electorate at the best of times is being aggravated by a reduction in the balance between grain growing and wool production. These are the sorts of side issues that get neglected when one tries to focus on the direct problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation takes a relatively simple step in reducing the requirement for fixed release from the stockpile, from 182,000 bales per quarter to 135,000 bales per quarter until 30 June 1997, and then 90,000 bales thereafter. Conversely, and I think probably unwisely, we also see the maximum allowable go out to 350,000 bales, which basically says, `Release is now again open slather.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind the House that, whilst that was a consensus decision taken by all sectors of the industry, in terms of the confidence factor it has totally removed it again. We moved on Garnaut's recommendation to fix release in a very narrow range of minimum and maximum because, as he pointed out, the previous arrangement did not let the industry, at the buying end, know the quantities that were coming out of the stockpile and that they could not budget for it when they went to buy fresh wool.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have reminded this House of the most significant words that I have heard in this debate. They were made by a wool trader who said at a meeting that I attended that he did not care how expensive wool got but he was deeply concerned at what his competitor paid for it tomorrow. The fundamental of this issue is that, if those sitting in an auction room bidding for fresh wool have no idea of what is going on at Wool International, they take out insurance <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6879"> by paying less. That will continue and we will have people keeping their own stockholdings down to the lowest possible minimum, with the intention of making sure that they do not get caught again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This problem will not be resolved by having such a wide differential between the minimum to be sold and the maximum, unless there are some very clear declarations made in advance as to the intentions of Wool International in that regard. It is all about certainty and, whilst we recognise the problems relating to demand, I think certainty or the lack of it has been the real issue into the steady decline of prices in the wool industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the movement of prices downwards, after the announcement of this arrangement, further adds to that problem. I am not totally happy with the move but, on the other hand, I support it as an improvement and as something that was achieved by a consensus arrangement between all aspects of the industry. Unless, as a consequence, Wool International, in the marketing of its own stockpile, improves the transparency of its negotiations, I do not think confidence will return by this measure. To me, transparency means everybody knowing Wool International's forward price, before a particular quarter commences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I draw attention to the fact that there were similar concerns in the wheat industry when the Wheat Board entered into the domestic markets in a big way. It was doing deals and making private sales out of its own stockpiles, which we refer to as `the pools'. People got very concerned about the integrity of that process and, I think, with good judgment. We had the situation where the domestic trading arm and the WIF were making magnificent profits. And, of course, it is easy to make profits when you are buying from yourself. We had a transfer from the revenues of the pools to the revenues of domestic trading and WIF investors. I do not want to go too far down their track but their solution was to start calling forward tenders so that the market became transparent. They went as far as to appoint KPMG Peat Marwick to open the tenders so that not even their own operation had access to those tenders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It appears to me that it would be a practical approach for Wool International to nominate its disposal for the forthcoming quarter and to consequently call tenders on the basis that&mdash;this is always common in such tendering&mdash;anybody who did not bother to participate in the tender but wished to purchase wool at the level set by the tender process could only do so at a premium. That means that you could not sit back and let one of your colleagues be the sole tenderer and then you benefit from that depleted price.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there was a true tender process&mdash;as I said, in one quarter for wool of the next quarter&mdash;that was subject to the condition of no tender necessarily accepted, as with the Wheat Board, I think we would see the prices get into the marketplace early. This would help buyers, particularly those with this very flexible arrangement of 90,000 to 350,000. It would also give Wool International the opportunity to state its intentions very clearly. It would put a floor in the fresh wool market so that people could go in and bid, knowing that they did not have someone else&mdash;one of their competitors&mdash;on the telephone doing a deal with Wool International into the forward market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have corresponded with Mr Richardson on this matter and he says, `Our activities are transparent.' If he means that they do a deal and then announce it, yes, it is transparent to that extent. But that is no help to you if you are in the open auction system bidding for fresh wool while the telephone conversations are going on; you do not know what they are up to. So I think we could progress this forward and I think there is opportunity to follow down the road of the AWB tender system&mdash;with variations, no doubt. It is something that would give genuine <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6880"> transparency and give people a clear indication as to where they stood. This system would be much more positive were that to be included. I do not think it requires legislation&mdash;it would just become the selling policy of Wool International.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other aspect of all of this&mdash;and other members have referred to it&mdash;is that demand for textiles and quality clothing is down internationally and, being a provider of product to the higher end of the market, we have seen a disproportionate effect on wool. We have been contributors to promotion through the International Wool Secretariat for as long as I can remember. Unfortunately, the method by which we raise funds for that is inversely proportional to the need. In other words, the lower the sales the lower the amount of money we have to promote sales, and the higher the sales the larger amount of money we have to promote sales. That is an inverse ratio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Everyone will tell you that when life gets tough, you have to expand your promotion to try and lift the market. Yet we have a system that reduces the amount of money at that time. Whilst I am totally opposed to the concept of Wool International investing in a marketing proposal called Wool International Holdings&mdash;I have no support for their proposals there at all&mdash;as a wool grower I am quite happy to see some of my investment in Wool International used in this downturn for positive promotion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I want to add a concept to that promotion. We have just heard the previous speaker, the member for Calare (Mr Andren), worrying about whether cotton is getting ahead of wool or, for that matter, whether synthetics are getting ahead of wool. I have always wondered why we had to keep wool as an unique product when there were great market opportunities in blends. But, putting that aside, the issue really is about getting people back to wearing some decent clothes, convincing them that their discretionary income should go in that direction. We have to get the models and the film stars and, I might add, we have to get the schoolteachers to come to school looking as though they appreciate the clothes they wear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have just come back from the Melbourne Cup, where we had an argument about what people should be wearing on that day. But, let me tell you, if they all wore morning suits it would sell a hell of a lot of wool. The reality is that we have to convince the world that this scruffy approach is not good enough. We have to get the basketballers back into some trim gear and we have to encourage women to dress up a little more to go to the supermarket. That is something we should do together&mdash;the cotton industry, the synthetics industry and the wool industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you think of our gross advertising budget, what we put into wool promotion is minuscule. If the three industries together put 10 per cent of our total marketing into just making people more aware and more keen to dress up, instead of spending it at the casino or wherever else they spend it today, then I do not think the wool industry would have any problems with its percentage share of the market. I think you grow the market and we have got to get our bit. Of course, as we convince people through all of those things that one should also be seen in a superior product, then hopefully our market share would grow with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should still direct a substantial part of our advertising budget to the special attributes of wool clothing and wool textiles. But the reality is we want some growth in the textile market. I hope by this speech I can encourage those who are directly involved to go out and say to our competitors, `Let's get together on the issue of improving the actual demand for textiles.' It is low and partly that is because people have, by any standard, become very scruffy.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6881">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One only has to look at the century&hyphen;old advertisements for the AFL to see how people dressed when they went to the football 100 years ago: there were rows and rows of three&hyphen;piece suits and hats. Of course, that has changed and it has made it a lot more difficult for our industry. As one of the positives, whilst we try and patch up the problems of supply, when we look at demand we have got to look past promoting wool. There are all these arguments about whether we should promote only Australian wool and, okay, there is a component for that. But, generally, we want people around the world to dress better and to be more conscious of the clothing they wear, and there are promotional activities, of course, that can do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last couple of minutes, I just want to come back to my arguments about Wool International Holdings, which is all part of this particular program. There is simply no reason to invest wool growers' money in an aspect of marketing when the industry, as established, can do all of those things. If Wool International Holdings has got some super whiz ideas and if they have got some computer people or others who can provide us with better mechanisms for selling wool, then let them make them available to the industry as a whole. If they have spent a little of my money on it, that is fine. But there is no reason for them to sequester $24 million of wool growers' reserves to go out there to keep themselves in a job, and that is what it is all about&mdash;when they are finished selling the stockpile, they are finished. It is up to competitive industry to get out there and to market wool better and to convince growers that that is the best way to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Advertisements appear regularly in papers in my electorate telling people, `Send your wool to us' and giving seven different ways in which they will sell it for them. If there is an eighth way that is better, let that private concern add it to its list. But I am deeply concerned to see that the two largest private concerns now want to make an agreement with Wool International Holdings and come forward and say, `We'll do it better, but we'll also control 70 per cent of the market.' That is terrifying. Wool is not grain; wool is in many categories. Wool is a different product, and people are entitled to a system that represents that issue. I sell wool every year and I bet that, if I bothered to go back, I would probably find that the same buyer buys it every year. He is comfortable with it and he knows what I produce. It is not all that special but, on the other hand, he knows it and he would buy it because of that. Once I am put into some massive system, whatever advantage I have achieved for myself over those years is lost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are some of the points I want to make and I really want to stress two points. The first one is transparency in the disposal of the stockpile&mdash;genuine forward transparency. If there is to be a forward market, there has got to be forward transparency. The second point is that I would like to think that we had the sort of change to our international promotional activities that I have outlined.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Wool International Amendment Bill 1996 should be called the `half Bourbon' bill: it has learnt nothing, and it has forgotten everything. It really does not add anything, in my view, to the wool industry. You do need transparency in the market. That transparency can only be achieved by selling all the wool on the auction market without reserve, and that is how it should have been disposed of. But that does not provide jobs for Wool International in the long term.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember going to Dubbo when the Garnaut report was released. The Garnaut report was a very flawed document, as one would expect from the author of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia and the Northeast Asian Ascendancy</EMPHASIS> report. I remember going and addressing a crowd at Dubbo and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6882"> expressing my concerns about the shortcomings of his proposals. The now Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) got up and read&mdash;in his well&hyphen;articulated, nice, school&hyphen;rounded vowels&mdash;great tracts from the Garnaut report. At morning tea, a fellow said to me, `By jove, we're lucky to have a bright young fellow like John Anderson up there in parliament, representing us!' I felt then that they were about to get the government they deserved. John Anderson sat at his round table, and who did he have at the round table? All the same people who have been going round and round for years. There was nothing new there and there was nothing new that could come out of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite clear that what we are doing here is simply adding to the likelihood of a Wool International dynasty; an organisation which, I believe, should be swept away at the very first opportunity. We have heard people here today talk about various aspects of wool marketing. It is my view that wool marketing is not the concern of wool growers; it is the concern of people who make the end product&mdash;they are better at it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I finished wool classing in South Australia in, I think, 1956. When we got our certificates the director said to us, `Every one of you will now go out and overclass the clip,' which every one of us did and still do. He said, `And if you want a future in 25 years, you have to address the American market; you have to raise the percentage of wool used in the American market.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We spent $2 billion worth of growers' money doing that and we have achieved nothing. The level of wool use is about the same as it was. On the other hand, Zegna went into North America; it sent Jonathon Todhunter into North America with a month's wages and after that he was on his own. North America is now one of Zegna's biggest markets. They had success. When you look at how we attempted to market wool in America, $2 billion is an awful lot of money to growers but it is infinitesimal over that period in terms of television advertising. It was a silly concept and it failed because it was silly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the generic marketing of wool should be swept away; it is a nonsense. What the Australian wool grower is doing is promoting everybody else's wool. We are not in the wool business, we are in the merino business and it is that which we need to promote. I recall going to China on one occasion. The delegation asked whether we could actually go to a shop where the Chinese shopped and I was amazed at the volume of stuff that was being sold out of this fifth floor: very high prices with a big banner saying `Bespoke tailoring, only the finest British cloth used.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said to the young lady, `Do you have any Australian woollen jumpers?' `Oh no, sir,' she said, `we stock only the finest British wool.' So I asked to have a look at a Pringle jumper. I said, `Look, there you are: it says guaranteed pure botany wool.' She said, `No, no, no. Look, made in England.' You could not convince her that it was Australian wool.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Pringle did not use the woolmark because they realised that everybody else used it and there was no value in it; there was no status in it. All you have to do to use woolmark is produce hair off a sheep. That has been very detrimental to the Australian wool grower. I believe we should be promoting Australian wool; and not necessarily Australian wool but we should have competing brands within Australia so that at the end of the day what is sold is Australian.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Wool is a tremendously important industry&mdash;unlike the tourist industry, it actually contributes greatly to rural Australia. It is probably the biggest small business in Australia. I believe that it is being very badly treated. We hear talk about wool's market share. The member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) spoke about a buyer who said that he did not care what <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6883"> the price was. That is an absurd statement. It is quite clear that wool is price sensitive, particularly in the band where most sold wool occurs, the 20 to 24 micron range.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minute it goes above a certain point, Marks and Spencer's computers start to tick away and they change their blend so there is less wool and more synthetic. When you consider that they are selling a suit somewhere in the world every 30 seconds, it is a very important factor. Wool is price sensitive: the traditional ratio has been about three to one on cotton. When it gets over that, there is downward pressure on its use; when it is under that, use tends to be pushed up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is for the great bulk of our wool; that 20 to 24 micron range. If you look at commodity prices throughout the world, since about 1974 commodity prices have been trending downwards. This means that wool producers are going to be under continuing cost pressure and this has to be addressed. How do you address this? Do you address it by having Wool International Holdings aligned with the two biggest wool brokers in Australia? I think not. What has to happen is that wool growers have to hold on to that product till further down the production chain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But this could only happen in a totally free market and if wool growers could organise themselves to hold on to their product down to the yarn stage&mdash;you will notice that in recent times when there have been dramatic drops in the price of even tops, when tops have been selling below cost, the price of yarn has not altered much&mdash;and if we could organise the sale of yarn by areas. A friend of mine has just registered `Nullarbor' as a brand name because he believes there will be a change in Europe. Europe is still the trendsetter&mdash;not China, not Japan&mdash;in wool design, and he thinks there will be a move towards sports coats. Twenty&hyphen;four micron wool is ideal for sports coats. He believes that there is a substantial industry there supplying 24 micron wool guaranteed environmentally friendly&mdash;no pollutants at all. And that is one thing Australia has to offer&mdash;that clean, green image.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Calare (Mr Andren) mentioned ovine johne's disease. It is a disgrace that it was not stamped out when it arrived here from New Zealand but it was ignored and allowed to spread. It should be stamped out now and the people affected by it should be compensated by the government because it was the fault of the government. We see AQIS moving to the rational economic field and there are people in AQIS who actually believe that we will all be better off, that the playing field will be truly level, when we all have the same diseases. I believe this is a national disgrace and it has been ignored by all major parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for O'Connor mentioned Wool International Holdings and he objects very strongly to its operation. I know there are very many members of the government&mdash;both in the National Party and the Liberal Party&mdash;who did not support that bill. But, like the member for O'Connor, they all voted for it and I think that is a disservice to the people they are purporting to represent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Calare mentioned making more use of Australian wool. Quite clearly, it is better if we can get Australian wool used in blanket production for hospitals. I was in Esperance recently and I tend to fossick around army disposal stores, and I came on some wool singlets made for the army in 1948. I bought a heap of them. They are extremely comfortable and surprisingly good for hot climates. Worn next to the skin, there is no trouble at all, and that is army gear of 1948. I suspect it was made of probably nothing less than 20 micron wool but certainly it is quite comfortable on the skin. So technology existed then for this material. Yet the last time I went to a Kangaroo exercise&mdash;I think it was Kangaroo `92&mdash;the soldiers <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6884"> were complaining about their polyester shirts and how uncomfortable they were in the tropics. The shirts made life almost unbearable for them; you could see the sweat pouring off them. If the army had experimented with a wool&hyphen;cotton mixture, perhaps a wool&hyphen;cotton polyester, it would have provided our soldiers with a much better garment. Certainly I believe that our serving people should have the very best equipment and cost is not a real consideration in that exercise, because the additional cost is actually quite minuscule.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the wool industry, you have to get some meat back on the bones. The wool industry has suffered enormously in recent times and a lot of this, in my view, has been self-inflicted because the wool industry has left representation to its so-called peak bodies and I do not believe they have represented the industry well. They have left it very much to government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not the occasional low price that devastates the industry. It is the years and years of declining prices; of prices just above the cost of production. If you actually graph the price of wool since wool has been marketed, probably 150 years, wool has gone through 700c&mdash;in 1988 dollar terms&mdash;2&half; times every 10 years except for that period when it was interfered with by the so-called organised marketing. I think that that is going to be coming under increasing pressure as commodity prices slide. As I said, the only way to improve this is to move further down the production chain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have made moves in that direction and I want it on the record that the Austops plant in Parkes&mdash;which the member for the area, Michael Cobb, supported very strongly, as did I&mdash;is a big success. It is the only top maker in Australia whose order books are full on a 24&hyphen;hour production run for at least six months ahead. It is doing very well. That facility was actually achieved under enormous opposition from elements in the wool industry. The attacks on Mr Todhunter, the man whose idea it was, were appalling. I think it is a disgrace the way he was treated and certainly a blight on the previous Attorney&hyphen;General, Michael Lavarch. I am glad that it was resolved very much in Mr Todhunter's favour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we see in this bill is better than existed before. It is a little late&mdash;we should have had these changes before, when wool was at very low prices and we were still allowing Wool International to sell forward at lower prices than the closing prices on the auction market. Wool International's argument was, `Oh, but we sold at a premium in a rising market. You would expect us to sell at a loss in a falling market.' That is nonsense. Anyone can sell at a premium in a rising market. What marketing is about is maintaining your advantage. It is quite clear that if you sell forward at a lower price than your closing price, then the opening price for your next auction is going to be lower. That is just simple, elementary, primary school economics. I fail to see how governments and the genii of Wool International could not understand this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I am saying is that this schedule will be much better if they are forced to sell it on the open market without reserve. That is the only way you are going to get transparency into it. What is important is not to make a profit on the wool stockpile, not to balance the books for the convenience of government, but to put meat back on the bones of the wool producer. And that is not, in my view, going to be achieved by this. I think we will see a rise in wool in the new year and that will certainly be most welcome. But unless we address the fundamental underlying problems, it will be another cyclical rise. And welcome as that will be, it will not be something on which you can built the future or the confidence of the industry.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was interested to hear the attack on merino stud breeders by the member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur). I have always seen the member for Corangamite as the hero, the doyen, of the merino stud breeders. I remember when I was lobbying to get the export of Australian genetic material banned, the member for Corangamite was one of the people standing up and saying, `Oh no, we can't do this.' He was acting at the behest of those second&hyphen;rung or second&hyphen;grade merino breeders who thought they could make a quick quid out of exporting their merino product without any consideration for the long term effect on the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my endeavours to stop the export of Australian genetic material and genetic technology, I had the support of all the major studs. It was only a small element of the merino stud breeders that opposed it. Australia has been lucky in the past because our main customers have been communist countries and, through their incompetence, they wasted the opportunity they had. Instead of centralising the breeding stations, as we kept telling them to do, they tended very foolishly to put them out as rewards to good communes. The genetic material was therefore lost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the threat in the future is going to be from South America. It will be driven by the Italians&mdash;and the Italians simply will not make that mistake. With the new technology, 900 rams a year might as well be nine million&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just want to make a couple more points in this rather disjointed process. In the dying days of Bob Hawke's prime ministership, he had a look at the proposal to put the wool stockpile into what was called zero coupon bonds. He had his experts look at it and they determined that, in the rising market, it was highly feasible and they undertook to do that. Unfortunately, within a few days he had lost to Keating, who never had any interest at all in the wool industry. In my view, a great opportunity to get rid of the wool stockpile, and not have growers plagued with this enormous overhang in the market, was lost. It was an idea that clearly would have worked and it is a pity that it did not get support from the wool industry. I guess there were people in the wool industry who saw themselves being out of a job if the stockpile ceased to exist.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join a long list of speakers this morning who have spoken in woollen suits, cotton shirts and synthetic ties. I welcome the introduction of this bill which sets new, overdue and more flexible parameters for the selling of stockpile wool. It is intended that the very last bale from the stockpile will be sold by 31 December 2000. Before that, the debt will be totally retired by 31 December 1998. Of course, in both instances, an earlier date is possible. The sales that do take place between the end of 1998 and the year 2000 will build up a surplus of dollars which will eventually be returned to the wool growers, as they largely determine, in one form or another.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to cast our minds back over what wool growers in this country have been through in the last half decade to decade. The stockpile has been in excess of 4.6 million bales. Today it is 2.04 million bales, according to the last figure I saw in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Land</EMPHASIS>. So we have more than halved it and it has been a painful process. The debt has come down from $2.8 billion to something around $1 billion today. On that billion&hyphen;dollar debt there is a government guarantee, which means that the interest rate is lower than it would otherwise be. I do not know what that is, but it would probably be around seven or eight per cent.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6886">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot of the wool now in the stockpile is old and matted. Some of it is triple dumped, it shows a certain amount of discolouring, and has to be discounted when it is sold&mdash;by something of the order of 25 to 30 cents a kilogram in some cases&mdash;because it has to be steamed and pulled apart. The composition of the stockpile is mainly over 21&hyphen;micron wool. When I looked in last week's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Land</EMPHASIS>, I think only two bales that had been sold for the week were less than 20.5 micron. So the great bulk of the wool is in the broader micron category.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the fixed selling schedule under the Garnaut  recommendations, which have been in place since 1993, we had to sell 187,000 bales a quarter&mdash;give or take 5,000 bales&mdash;which was a minimum of 728,000 a year. That is not an inconsiderable amount of wool as a percentage of total Australian sales. That was all very well, as previous speakers have said, on a stable or rising market. But it did run into somewhat unforeseen problems on a falling market, mainly in the psychological impact it had on the market when the market was coming down and you were trying to sell forward so that you were not caught trying to off&hyphen;load all your quarterly stockpile requirement at the end of the quarter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It had to be discounted and, even if the discounting was done in a quite proper commercial way, the psychological effect on the market was very bearish indeed, particularly when you took into account the discounting that had to take place because of the age and matting qualities of the wool. If you were discounting even 20, 30 or 40 cents a kilogram, it had a quite depressing effect on the market&mdash;more than it otherwise should have. This meant that when the market rose the stockpile sales tended to clip that rise a bit, but when the market fell it accentuated the fall. Generally speaking, it has been a large contributor to the flat and falling markets that we have seen in recent years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister, to his credit, has agreed that the minimum requirement should fall to 135,000 bales per quarter between January and the end of June next year, with a maximum of 350,000 bales. That is a lift in the upper limit. From 1 July next year until the last bale is sold the minimum will be 90,000 bales a quarter and the maximum 350,000 bales a quarter. In other words, the minimum is about half of what is applying now. That will be very welcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When that happens and the stockpile numbers get down, the other, more basic fundamentals&mdash;supply and demand&mdash;can come into play more. If you look at world wool supply, you will see that it is actually down on traditional volumes that have existed in the past. Australia is not producing much more than 600 million kilograms at the moment. In the heyday of a decade ago we were churning out from 700 million to over 1,000 million kilograms a year. So all the supply signals should be saying that the price of wool should be much higher than it is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe demand will improve. Russian dumping has fallen away and as the world economy picks up, the secondary stockpile numbers fall and, in particular, the main stockpile numbers come down to a million bales or less, then I think we shall see a slow and steady increase in market price, which is good. When you connect that with the reasonably buoyant mutton and lamb prices that we have enjoyed in recent times, there are hopefully good days ahead again for wool growers in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to think about what you would have done with the stockpile, had it been your own private business. Let us look at what businesses would do when caught in such situations&mdash;not that I think too many businesses would be caught in such a diabolical situation as happened with the stockpile. Probably they would sell it all off in one year, if not less. They would have taken immense pain in the short term&mdash;more pain than we are experiencing now&mdash; <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6887"> but they would have cleared the problem away. If that had happened, we would probably now be selling fresh wool into a pure market situation, and that situation would be behind us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a hypothetical situation, of course, because we cannot do that with something which is, in a sense, a public asset. Nevertheless, what we are doing is quite different from what we would be doing in private business. We should never forget that. It is an interesting thing that we should all reflect on from time to time. The moral of all that is the less government control and interference in any market situation the better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some subtle changes mooted in this bill, apart from what I have spoken of, which concern the objectives of Wool International. The change is that, when determining the rate of disposal of the wool stockpile, Wool International will be required to take into account the profitability and efficiency of the Australian wool industry in the short, medium and long term. Until now, that consideration has only applied to the long term. It will now apply to short and medium term as well, which I think is perfectly logical.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, I believe the changes are very sensible. They have been well accepted throughout all of the wool industry. The minister has done a great job in pulling the industry opinion together to recommend the changes in this bill. If you go to a meeting with some 100 growers there, there will be at least 101 opinions. A significant proportion of those opinions will change throughout the course of the meeting&mdash;not only change once but, in some cases, several times. It has been a nightmare trying to get some sort of consensus position within the industry. At the end of the day, I think the minister did a remarkable job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to see that, while some disagree with what has happened, there is across&hyphen;the&hyphen;industry support for it. Wool growers can now see the future more clearly. There are deadlines in place for clearing debt and clearing the stockpile. As I say, once the stockpile comes down below one million bales, the market can start rising again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will just make some quick general remarks pertinent to the wool industry and to this bill. I mentioned earlier that there has been immense pain for wool growers in this industry over the last few years. During that time, all elements of the industry have been unprofitable. It has put incredible stress on families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As one who represents 40 per cent of New South Wales, including most of the western division and including many farming families who can do nothing else on their properties except grow wool, I have seen a lot of this hardship take place. It has also caused me great grief as a wool grower. Through that time, these families have also been through drought as well as on occasion having interest rates over 20 per cent, and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation was brought home to me when I was in Bourke the other day at an opening of Centacare, which is a Roman Catholic&hyphen;run body&mdash;partly funded by the Commonwealth government&mdash;that assists people in financial and other troubles. It had been operating for a month before the opening and already many of the families that were on their books for counselling were farming families, going back several generations on the land, who had been forced off their properties in recent years through this wool crisis and were now living in the town of Bourke. Some of them might have chosen to move to coastal areas in their forced retirement, but they could not afford to do so. There they are living in Bourke. Some of the families have split up while others are staying together under great mental stress. I am pleased to see that organisations like Centacare are assisting these people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I add that Sister Margaret Flynn, who has been a driving force behind Centacare in the central west of New South Wales, is based in Forbes and runs another Centacare office down <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6888"> there. It also has on its books, as a significant part of its clientele, farming families in trouble that have been through the recent recessionary periods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the price of wool, as I have said, it has been frustratingly low in recent years. Sales this year are significantly higher than last year&mdash;by 25 to 30 per cent in some instances. Overseas demand is flat and the price for the competitive fibres to wool&mdash;cotton and synthetics&mdash;are also reasonably flat. At the moment, the ratio of wool to cotton and synthetics is about 2&half;:1. So, traditionally, we can expect no more than perhaps a 20 per cent lift in the short term if that ratio is to be maintained. But if that happened, of course, the price of wool would lift from about 600c to 700c and at least that would lift it to a break&hyphen;even situation for a lot of growers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a great deal of soul searching in the wool industry in recent times over questions such as advertising of the International Wool Secretariat: should it be generic or brand, should it be pitched at the younger rather than the more mature consumer, should it concentrate on selling pure wool or blended wool, and so on. These are matters for debate which will go on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regarding the Woolmark&mdash;the famous Woolmark which is so well&hyphen;known around the world that we now charge for its use&mdash;I think 3,600&hyphen;odd companies have registered for it and that has brought in $16 million, which is badly needed, particularly in light of the fact that the previous government only a short time ago chopped off the last $20 million that they used to give us for wool promotion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have in place, now it has been launched, the India 2005 strategy to get the domestic use of wool in India up and also their purchases of Australian wool, which they will process and re&hyphen;export. I think that is a welcome initiative. Indeed, the Deputy Prime Minister returns from India tomorrow, I think&mdash;if not tonight&mdash;and I look forward to hearing what he has to report on that particular initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has also been in recent times a different focus on wool blends. The wool plus lycra mix going into knitwear and woven wear is showing good signs of success and there are opportunities for an increased drive into value added blends which will open us up into new markets. In recent decades we have lost the young market; we have lost the casual market; we have lost the sporting market; we have lost the hospital blanket market; we have lost the working clothes market, and there have been changes in the work force of those who use wool. Airconditioning means that we use a lighter weight fabric and, with the build&hyphen;up in cotton and other fibres, wool is being hit from every angle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth remembering that wool has got only 20 per cent of the world apparel market even though Australia produces over 80 per cent of the world quality wool apparel market. We live in a dynamic and ever&hyphen;changing world and market. Long gone are the days of fixed prices, reserve schemes, regulating supplies, influencing demand in improper ways and so on. Ownership of a property and a mob of sheep certainly does not guarantee anybody a living income these days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I would like to compliment one initiative of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) who has extended the drought exceptional circumstances assistance, after you are taken out of drought, from six months to 12 months. That is very welcome in my area and will allow many farming families that would have been taken off that assistance about Christmas time this year to continue it for another six months. All that will help keep wool growers on their farms, put food on their tables in the interim and, hopefully, with some <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6889"> good seasons and some rising prices, there is optimism again for the wool industry in the future.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to support the words of my good friend and colleague the member for Parkes (Mr Cobb), who has outlined some very important challenges that face the wool industry. I join this debate as a wool grower and also as someone who represents one of the great wool growing areas in Australia. I am very proud to represent that area, but I have to say that it has certainly suffered over the last six years with some of the problems that the wool industry has been facing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that this bill, the Wool International Amendment Bill 1996, does go some way towards alleviating some of the immediate pressures that the wool industry is facing. What it does has been outlined, but it is worth repeating that the quarterly disposal mechanism for Wool International from the stockpile is to be altered as of 1 January to a minimum of 135,000 bales for each of the next two quarters, and then from 1 July next year it will lower to a minimum of 90,000 bales. As well as that, there will be an upper limit of 350,000 bales per quarter, and there is a target date of the end of 1998 for the debt of Wool International to be completely paid off. Also, there is another target date, the end of December 2000, to completely get rid of the stockpile.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another very important and significant point about this legislation is that Wool International's charter will include a requirement that its sales objective be to improve the net return, not only for the stockpile wool but also for the whole wool industry in Australia. I think that is a very important aspect of this change. It is one that growers have been looking for, and it is certainly one that I believe, with the flexibility that is coming about through this new stockpile arrangement, will allow growers and Wool International the opportunity to look at how best to maximise the value for the industry in the coming years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As has already been outlined, the industry certainly has been going through a very difficult period. I feel that by addressing this immediate problem of the stockpile disposal&mdash;and unfortunately this is not the first time that this has been addressed&mdash;we will allow the industry to really focus on what I see as the biggest challenge; that is, how to create additional demand for wool. There is no doubt that wool has had some difficulties over recent years, many of them brought about through factors beyond the control of the industry&mdash;for example, the collapse of the former Soviet Union and the recession in much of Western Europe in the early 1990s. The compounding of all these things has certainly, with the overhang of the stockpile, made it very difficult for the market to return to the sorts of prices that are desperately needed in order to make wool growing a profitable business again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, all in all, it has been a very difficult period. But from the work that the minister has put in at two very productive meetings of the round table when representatives of all areas of the wool industry came to Canberra, there was very strong agreement to proceed down this path with the wool stockpile management proposal that is in this legislation. It is also very heartening to know that the proposal has strong support right throughout the parliament. I believe that it will pass through fairly quickly, as expected, so those changes will be able to be implemented from 1 January, which of course is not very far away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say that the big challenge now is to increase demand. I think it is time that we put that challenge in perspective by looking at what a couple of other primary industries have been through. In both cases there were similar difficulties, and they have now come out much stronger. I am talking about the dairy industry and the wine industry. While there are many <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6890"> parallels, there are quite a few differences, but nonetheless I think it is illustrative to look at some of the figures that show what has been done with those two industries. I would like to quote a few statistics to show just what has happened. As everyone knows, it was only about 12 years ago that the dairy industry was on its knees, and yet today it is an industry that has pulled itself up to become a very successful exporter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we go back to 1970, the production of milk per farm was around 240,000 litres per year; by 1994&hyphen;95, the production per farm had nearly trebled to 610,000 litres; and this year it is estimated to be around 650,000 litres. Interestingly, from 1970 to 1994&hyphen;95 the production per cow increased by 37 per cent. In fact, I heard a researcher saying that in the last 25 years the potential has increased by significantly more than that; in some areas, the production per cow has literally doubled. More significantly, there is an expectation that the production will double again in the next 25 years. What I am saying is that there is a challenge for the wool industry to see what production improvements can be made on farm; I do not believe that the limit has been reached. We have opportunities to make some significant increases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also significant to note the impact that the dairy industry has had on exports. While Australia produces just two per cent of the world milk production, it has 10 per cent of the world trade. Just 20 years ago, dairy exports were $250 million; today, they are in excess of $1.3 billion&mdash;of that, $1.2 billion actually comes from Victoria, so I am very much aware of the significance of the exports in a local way. That is an increase of 430 per cent. The dairy industry has achieved that not only by continuing to export what we might call the traditional products&mdash;dried milk powder, basic cheese and butter&mdash;but also by going into all sorts of value adding products. The increases in exports to some of the Asian countries have been truly staggering with an increase of at least 15 per cent per year being quite common.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note that if you go to the waterfront in Melbourne more than half the container exports out of Melbourne are dairy products. By this example I am attempting to show that here is an industry that took up the challenge. Dairy farmers were on their knees 12 years ago, but they took up the challenge and moved into exporting a whole lot of new products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also draw attention to the wine industry where, again, we see some very interesting similarities. In the mid&hyphen;1980s, there was a chronic oversupply of wine. Our exports were relatively small with an emphasis on premium varieties. What Australia has done in the wine industry has been to concentrate on value adding. Since 1966, wine production has actually tripled and, more significantly, the industry adds over $900 million to purchased inputs, which is seven times the farm gate value of what it has been producing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only that, the wine industry has demonstrated that it can succeed overseas on quality&mdash;something that, as an analogy, I believe the wool industry is also very well placed to do. This success has led to higher margins and the Australian product is seen as quality wine. There is a push towards consumers trading up to quality wine, and the actual sales of bulk wines are declining. These are all significant factors. If you look at the industry's strategic plan, by the year 2025 it plans to achieve $4.5 billion in annual sales&mdash;a very significant figure. I point out that that is on a par with the total value of wool production.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The wool industry is very much at a crossroads. We have already seen a decline in the national sheep flock by a third; it is down to its lowest level for about 40 years. The challenge now is to take up this demand creating opportunity&mdash;while we still have some stockpile there&mdash;and turn the stockpile into an asset. The way to do that is to generate more demand <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6891"> and I believe that a number of very significant things will be happening down that track. For example, the IWS is now taking a much more forward approach to its marketing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also very heartened to note that the IWS is likely to be subject to more accountability from the Wool Council, which is something that I happen to think is long overdue. I believe that these are the sorts of challenges and pressures that have to be placed on the marketing arm of the wool industry to really start to get some results.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that time is limited here: I could go on for much longer, but I will not. I would like to say again that I am very pleased to speak in support of the bill. I believe that it is a positive step forward in the management of the stockpile. The wool industry has indeed been through a very difficult period. However, there are still plenty of wool growers who are keen to see it recover and are working very hard to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that, through the opportunities that are going to come in the next few years, the wool industry will indeed become the premier primary industry in Australia again. I certainly believe it can do so. Looking at the way some of the other primary industries, such as dairying and the wine industry, have turned around after a very difficult period, I certainly believe that the opportunity, the challenge and the will are there. There is the chance to make it happen, and this legislation is the first step in setting it down on the path of recovery.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today, with the debate on the Wool International Amendment Bill 1996, we are strengthening, and continuing to hold on to, some ability to statutorily market the product wool, and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) is making a very laudable effort to enable Australian wool producers to collectively market their product. To me, it would be absolutely ludicrous if we were to deregulate completely this industry. I do not know how many wool producers we have got. I heard quoted recently the figure&mdash;but I do not know whether it is correct&mdash;of 40,000 wool producers in Australia, each one of them individually marketing his product.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To think you can capably market a product worth&mdash;even in its present state of decline&mdash;$3,000 million a year to the Australian economy, by having little producers, who each produce maybe $300,000 or $400,000 worth of wool, individually selling their wool on the world market is, to me, a ludicrous proposition. Clearly, the giant commodity traders&mdash;such as Itoh, which is often quoted as having 30 per cent of the world's market for wool&mdash;will clap their hands together and cheer loudly because, in each of the international commodities that I am familiar with, it appears unassailably that you have what the economists call a classical oligopoly situation. For us humble, simple Cloncurry boys, that is explained to me to mean that a few people have a monopoly, and that there is a monopoly working out there which is owned and controlled by a very few players.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Look at the international beef industry&mdash;dominated by giants, such as Conagra&mdash;or at the banana industry, of which Chiquita had 80 per cent of the world trade at one stage, and not so very many years ago, either, I might add. Or look at the wool industry, where Itoh is such a giant buyer; or at the sugar industry&mdash;where E.F. Mann and Tate and Lyle make even CSR look small beer. Tate and Lyle quoted recently that they had 50 operations throughout the world, each the size of Bundaberg Sugar, and that figure would make them very considerably larger than the entire Australian industry put together. So, how in heaven's name is some little sugarcane farmer from outside Babinda going to compete against the might of a company that is something like four or five times the size of the entire Australian sugar industry put <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6892"> together? Clearly, he is not; clearly, he is going to be torn to pieces in the marketplace because of the enormous market powers that are in control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I want to praise the minister who has had a very difficult row to hoe in arriving at this position. Of all the industries in Australia, wool is, if not the worst, most certainly close to the worst in lack of direction and centrality in decision making. So making any sort of decision is extremely difficult; whichever way one is going to move, one is going to be criticised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had people in this place&mdash;and I must say it is almost universal here&mdash;criticising the reserve price scheme, which absolutely amazes me. I have this terrible penchant for reading history books and people write down what occurred. The history books already read that prior to our securing the reserve price scheme, which was so brilliantly and courageously implemented by the then National Party leader, Doug Anthony, the auction price per kilogram for greasy wool was 64.7 cents. That was in 1970&hyphen;71. The year before it had been 82 cents, the year after it was 75 cents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Within one year of the introduction of the reserve price scheme the price had leapt to 180 cents per kilogram&mdash;a 300 per cent increase. It is more than passing strange that when we introduced a reserve price scheme the price suddenly leapt 300 per cent. That was pure coincidence! Not only that, the reserve price scheme was able to maintain and to build up that price continuously from 1972 through to almost 1992. It was around 500 to 600 cents per kilogram in the late 1980s and at the end of the 1990 financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Within one year of the demolition of the reserve price scheme, the price had fallen to 354 cents a kilogram from its high of 640 cents a kilogram in 1988&hyphen;89. So within 18 months of the removal of the reserve price scheme the price had collapsed straight through the floor. If any intelligent person wants to argue with me at any forum in Australia I am quite happy to do it, because no&hyphen;one in Australia who looks at that evidence is going to believe anything else but that if we introduce an aggressive statutory marketing arrangement that enables us to aggressively market our product, then we will achieve enormous results not only for that industry but for the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the ALP did was that Mr Kerin undermined the confidence of the market in the price. In fairness to him it was said that it was foisted upon him by the Prime Minister. But I was a minister for many years and there were three occasions on which I had to tender my resignation because I could not live with the decision that was foisted upon me from above. On the third occasion, I did in fact resign. So I say that it is not good enough to say, as the then Minister Kerin said on numerous occasions behind closed doors, `I was forced to do it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The result to the Australian economy is that whereas our nation, which I would like to think we all love, was enjoying an income of $6,000 million a year from wool, we now enjoy an income of $3,000 million a year from wool. That is thanks to Mr Kerin and Mr Keating, and to other people on our side of the House who were in favour of the demolition of the reserve price scheme. Well, some of them may have voted for it but they may not have been happy about voting for it, in fairness to them.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The point is that the confidence in the marketplace had been undermined completely. I have not got time to do the base research myself so I will quote from a speech by Senator Boswell in which he quoted his sources. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the week before Mr Kerin's infamous press conference in which he clearly indicated that the government was no longer going to stand behind the reserve price scheme we were buying only 20 per cent of the wool clip and the price was 890 cents a kilogram.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>Two weeks after his press conference, the reserve price scheme had to buy 80 per cent of the trade and the price had slumped to the reserve price minimum of 870c a kilo. So you can say it was the removal of the reserve price scheme, but it was the clear&hyphen;cut neon light signal that was sent out by the minister, stating that the government was going to walk away from the reserve price scheme, which in any event was the level playing field of the economic rationalist policies of the Keating government. That was the basic locomotive of their decision making for 13 years and we are reaping the whirlwind now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I put on record the price movements in the wool industry. There was a 300 per cent increase from 64c to 180c when we introduced the reserve price scheme and when we removed it there was a drop in the market from 640c down to 340c&mdash;it dropped clean in half.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not the full story of the damage. What has happened is that our sheep numbers have fallen some 40 per cent. I was corrected the other day when I said 30 per cent and they said 50 per cent. As far as I can see, there are a lot of different figures, but undoubtedly no&hyphen;one will argue that the sheep numbers in Australia have fallen by pretty close to 40 per cent. So we have lost our sheep now as well. Even if the price were to come back, there are not the sheep numbers there to produce the same revenue that would have existed had the price stayed where it was.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can also refer, as far as statutory marketing goes, to the sugar industry. Before the then minister, John McEwen, called a world conference on sugar, sugar had slumped to $56 per tonne. After the international agreement was negotiated by John McEwen, even though he always said he was deeply regretful that it was never as good and never held as strongly as he wanted it to, the price leapt from a low of around $60 per tonne up to around $130 per tonne by 1973.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there is anyone who doubts that we can achieve these sorts of results, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 10 October 1994 there was an article by John McIlwraith on a 50 per cent aluminium price rise. He went into the detail of how the world's aluminium producers were called together for a conference where they decided to take 10 per cent of the world production of aluminium off the world market. The net result was that the market strengthened and we had a 50 per cent rise in the price of aluminium.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer to a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> article dated 2 August 1993 which talks about the Brazilian government calling a conference of all the world's coffee producers. Coffee is a commodity very similar to wool in so far as there are probably only seven or eight countries in the world that are responsible for about 90 per cent of world production. They were called together by the Brazilian government and were successful in raising the price of coffee some 37 per cent over a four&hyphen;month period after the conference was called.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are numerous articles here on OPEC, where their conferences have been successful in affecting the price of oil and we have been able to see&mdash;or suffer&mdash;a vast increase in the price of oil.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6894">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whatever commodity we are talking about, where we have aggressive marketing policies and where we are prepared to be intelligent enough to act collectively, we can achieve results. The previous speaker, the member for Wannon (Mr Hawker), outlined what had been done in the dairying industry and there is no doubt that what he said was 100 per cent correct. Those people have had the intelligence to realise the absolute necessity for unity. In Australia today, after 13 years of Labor government, we have seen the absolutely disastrous rise of Woolworths and Coles and Franklins in this country, to a point where there are now only three people that you can buy anything off and there are only three people that you can sell to. I might add that, as far as the workers of Australia are concerned, there are only three employers in the retail trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have lifted their market share from around 60 per cent 10 or 15 years ago to where it is now at 74 per cent. There is no stopping it. With extended trading hours being introduced by various lackey governments throughout Australia, they will take an even bigger slice of the market. I tell you what, any of us politicians that want to assail them will not get much coverage in the media, because they are the biggest advertisers in Australia. You will not be getting too much coverage when you want to bring them to heel, and it will be a brave government that tries to stand against them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But if you are a manufacturer, if you are a food producer in this country, you now have only three people that you can sell to.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the division, I was talking about the absolute necessity for the collective marketing of our products. In spite of all that has transpired over the last 13 years, the labour market in Australia is collectively bargained. I believe that that is a very good thing. I have always believed that the right of the trade union movement and workers throughout Australia to collectively bargain is an important part of any properly functioning democracy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The medical profession is cutting off completely the supply of doctors into Australia. It is using its muscle power to ensure that no degree from anywhere else in the world will be recognised in Australia and that people from overseas countries will not be allowed to practise in Australia. In Queensland, the doctors have demanded that a person has a degree before being allowed into medical school, so that has cut off the supply of doctors there for three or four years. The medical profession is very effectively collectively bargaining its product.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, the level playing field is being forced upon the rural producers of Australia. It seems to me that only the manufacturing sector and the farming sector are being put to the sword. If we are not allowed to collectively bargain our products, the international commodity brokers who dominate the world marketplaces will tear us to pieces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been to a number of wool meetings in which the so&hyphen;called leadership of the industry has said that it is amazing that, even when the flow of wool onto the market is cut back dramatically, nothing has any influence upon the price. Getting back to the economists again, they have a name for that, and it is this big word that I did not understand called `oligopoly'. That is the name for a market mechanism that is unreactive to supply and demand. That is what is happening today in the wool industry throughout the world. I applaud the minister's moves to allow some sort of statutory marketing mechanism to be left in place.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6895">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other matter which must be dealt with here is the minister's moves to restrict half the flow of wool coming out of the stockpile by halfway through next year. It is my constantly reiterated contention that 20 per cent of the world's wool&mdash;some people would argue that it is 15 per cent&mdash;is coming out of the Australian stockpile. If you have the ability to cut off the source of 15 to 20 per cent of the world's wool then&mdash;as I clearly indicated happened with aluminium, coffee, oil, sugar in days past, and wool in days past&mdash;there will be a spectacular increase in the price of the product. So there should be a spectacular increase in the price of wool next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only thing that I would urge the minister to ensure is that we indicate to our buyers a steely determination not to put our product on the world market at below the cost of production. In fairness to them, with the volatility of the product and the skyrocketing prices, we should be delivering something to them on that sort of situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1988, the prices went to 1,200c a kilo and then, because of the towering incompetence of the people in charge at the time, it collapsed to 350c a kilo. Nobody wants to work in that sort of business. Everyone would want to get out of it. These people are not gamblers, they are businessmen. That sort of volatility in the market requires people to be gamblers, not business people. So I think we owe our end users some sort of stability and some sort of reduction in the volatility that exists at the present moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I knew that my competitor had to buy at the same price as I do, I would accept that situation. However, if I bought now and I did not know what the hell the price would be tomorrow, and I found that the competitor could undercut me by a huge amount, then that is not the sort of business that I would like to be in. If I wanted to become a professional gambler, I would spend my time down at the racetrack instead of in the business that I have addressed at various times throughout my life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, concerning the much maligned McEwen era in Australia, let us have a look at the scoreboard. Unemployment in 1972 was 1.9 per cent; the balance of payments was a surplus of $754 million; there were 2,600 bankruptcies as against 17,500 bankruptcies this year; and the value of the dollar was 384 Japanese yen to the Australian dollar whereas in 1997 it is 90 Japanese yen to the Australian dollar. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have spoken here many times before but not for quite a while. I had forgotten your title so I offer my apologies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to begin by thanking members for their contributions to the debate in this place and senators for their contributions in the other place. I know that there are many people who feel very strongly about the industry and the current plight in which it finds itself. I know that there are many members and senators too who have first&hyphen;hand experience either through their own family involvements in the industry or more generally, as is my own case, in terms of their interaction with their constituents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that the situation is a very serious one. I have made those observations before. After six years at least now of very low prices, often coupled with drought, many of our specialist wool growers in particular and the communities in which they live are on their <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6896"> financial knees. One can only express the very sincere hope that supply and demand will enter some new phase of equilibrium, a happier stage, in the very near future which will see a substantial improvement in prices. The flexibility that we are talking about before us in terms of the amendments to the Wool International Bill will hopefully allow for a better commercial outlook.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a point that arose out of the previous speaker's remarks, those of the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter), that I think needs a brief mention. It was his hope as expressed, if I understand him correctly, that by cutting in half the amount of wool that Wool International will place on the markets, the price of wool would respond strongly to that reduction in supply. It needs to be clearly recognised that we have imposed in this legislation significant disciplines on the market. For example, there is a target date in 1998 that the debt be wound up and a legislated requirement that the stockpile should be wound up by the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those disciplines in broad terms mean that Wool International will still be required to dispose of, on average, 130,000 to 135,000 bales of wool per quarter. The reality is that if the price starts to rise strongly then more can be sold and we may be able to acquit the stockpile. One needs to remember that much of it is now not young any more and if anything the tendency towards purchasers wanting discounts in the future for that wool out of the stockpile is likely to increase. Therefore, it is desirable that it be, frankly, shifted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed amendments before us are the result of an extensive consultation process by the industry culminating in the August round table. On coming to this particular portfolio I found an industry that was deeply divided, deeply dispirited&mdash;and I think that is entirely understandable&mdash;and at odds with one another over whether the real problem was, on the one hand, the stockpile and/or its management, or, on the other hand, demand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I came rapidly to the conclusion that we were not going to be able to effectively grapple with any of the problems, regardless of what one regarded as the most important and most pressing in terms of the need to find solutions, until we had established some industry unity and a deep awareness of the industry within its own ranks of both the desirability and the possibility of working together to find solutions and to ending the divisions. To this end we set about via the process of pulling together industry leaders, nationally and internationally, calling two ministerial round tables here in Canberra. We were seeking to establish that that unity was not only desirable but possible. I believe that we made tremendous progress.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The process between the two round tables of a very vigorous national debate over how to handle the stockpile was one of the most interesting that I have ever observed. I think it is fair to say that it started off as a fairly rocky period with some very strong views, often impossible to reconcile, being expressed by different players in the industry. As the debate rolled on several things happened, not the least of which, I suspect, was that many people became much more acutely aware of the real parameters within which we had to operate and gained a better understanding of the possibilities that were there and the challenges in front of us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The result was that by the time we had the second round table the views had distilled out pretty clearly. I have to say that I think that is tremendously important and the significance of it should never be lost by the industry. Although it took us about five hours at that second round table to get through item No. 2 on the agenda&mdash;the future management of the stockpile&mdash;and we spent much less time than I would have liked on the other items on the agenda, we did sort this through very thoroughly. It took a long time, but we were able to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6897"> agree on a very strong position of industry consensus. Many people made a great effort to secure that consensus; many moved considerably. That is the nature of reaching an agreed outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that I absolutely and totally reject the allegation made by one industry that consensus was a process which, in this instance, arrived at a non&hyphen;decision. That is absolute nonsense. The industry needs to recognise that when they call for their views to be heard, and when people take very serious steps to ensure that that request is met and come up with a solution, that cannot be dismissed as mere consensus. It has to be recognised for what it is&mdash;genuine leadership in an industry that has been crying out for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say that the recommendations that have been taken forward to the government, that have been accepted and are now about to become legislation are fully supported by the industry, including overseas customers who were a vital part of that round table process. I know that growers desperately need an injection of confidence. The international circus that arose when the Australian government flip&hyphen;flopped and belly&hyphen;ached all over the place in recent years and there was no certainty was something that I could not have allowed to happen again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was of vital importance that our international customers were drawn into this in a way which not only maintained but, if you like, secured or locked in their confidence in what we were doing in the future. That is what we set out to do and that is what I believe we have completed. I say to wool growers that it is very important that that be recognised. It is an extremely significant development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is fully committed to the implementation of the round table outcomes, as shown by these amendments to the legislation. There has been wide debate on how they might best be used to maximise the value of the industry for hard&hyphen;pressed wool growers. I am delighted to note that the industry is insistent upon taking control of that debate itself. I think that is a very healthy thing and makes me feel extremely comfortable about withdrawing government involvement in an area where the government no longer needs to involve itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of these amendments, there has been full consultation and, to date, bipartisan support. I do express my appreciation of that. I did so in the main chamber a little while ago and I do so again today. As I was able to extend a degree of bipartisan support to the then minister for primary industries in 1993 and as he was kind enough then to express his gratitude to me, I do so again in this instance. It is my view that it is very important that we now provide Wool International with full commercial flexibility in selling the stockpile to enable benefits to the industry to be maximised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also the case, as I have just touched on, that the government is signalling through these amendments its intention to continue to withdraw from the industry in those areas which are not matters for government involvement. The fact of the matter is, that for all the criticism now levelled at the fixed release schedule, it wound back the debt to the point where it is now below $1 billion dollars&mdash;a vastly healthier situation than the one which we once faced. The stockpile is now down to below two million bales and this gives us the flexibility to be able to address other urgent priorities; namely, of course, in this instance, trying to provide relief to growers in terms of the price they receive for their fresh product.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I express my confidence that the industry is ready and able to provide its own leadership. Again, I touched on that a moment ago. I want to elaborate slightly and I just want to say a couple of things. It concerns me that there has been something of a tendency to confuse what has to be seen, in any objective analysis, as courage and genuine desire on the part of some <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6898"> of the industry's leadership to help, to make a difference, to secure the future; that that is sometimes confused with&mdash;misrepresented as&mdash;a refusal to listen, or a lack of understanding, or an inability to represent grassroots concerns and desires.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that is largely the end of it as a process of the round table. There is still a bit of mopping up to do and I hope that mopping up takes place. Unity is important; and recognising that there are people out there fighting for the industry, when they have other options that they could turn to, is very important too. As I said recently at a rather, if you like, interesting growers meeting, it needs to be recognised that people like Dick Warburton are genuinely trying to secure a more modern industry and that that commitment arises out of their real belief that change can bring better results for growers. And sometimes I think it is a little easy to overlook that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been a lot of criticisms levelled, too, at growers' representatives. I really think that it is time that people got behind those representatives of their industry who are plainly trying to advance the causes and the interests of growers, and who are sometimes unfairly accused of not listening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make reference, on the way through, to the intelligent and understanding leadership of Rob Thirkell&hyphen;Johnston and Wool Council. It has not been easy for them, and it is altogether too easy to say that they are old guard, or not representative of the industry, or what have you. The bulk of them are practising wool growers. They have as much of an interest in sorting this through as anybody else does. And they are as frustrated by the problems of the industry as anybody else is in those industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the government's continuing involvement, there are some vitally important areas where we will continue to be involved and where, frankly, I think we can do more than has been done in the past. One obvious one is in creating the right broad economic environment for wool growers to operate in. Getting interest rates down is vitally important for growers with big debts, and there are too many of them. And, of course, since coming to power, we have seen a one per cent reduction, in broad terms, in interest rates and I sincerely hope that that is all passed on to wool growers. Across the Australian rural community it is worth around $200 million&mdash;quite a bit of money. Wool growers will experience some relief from that. There is more to be done and the government is determined to push ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Industrial relations reform is important. It is often forgotten that Professor Garnaut identified savings to the average wool grower of some thousands of dollars through better transport, handling and storage facilities&mdash;and waterfront, of course&mdash;which usually centres on greater efficiencies, which are dependent upon a more co&hyphen;operative industrial relations environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then, of course, there are questions such as market access and market negotiations which are very important, as is research and development. In relation to market access, the Mexican example that I referred to in the House the other day, whereby we provide wool tops and expertise as an input to the process to the Mexicans without tariffs getting in the way&mdash;they value add and re&hyphen;export under NAFTA without tariffs again into North America&mdash;is the very model of the sort of thing that we need to be looking for in the future; the very model of the sort of thing that governments in general, and ministers in particular, can help drive to the advancement of the industry in general terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another proposal that arises out of the desire of industry leaders to, in practical terms, meet their responsibility under the 1993 act to develop a more modern industry with forward trading and so forth is the joint venture. This initially surfaced as the proposal known as Wool <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6899"> International Holdings. It has evolved into something that is quite different. Maybe that is partly as a result of the very tight parameters that I put in front of the industry leadership when I became minister about what would be acceptable and what would not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leaving that aside, an information paper is now being prepared on the proposed joint venture between Wool International, Elders and Wesfarmers Dalgety. Again, there have been too many in the industry who have wanted to say, `You know, John, close this off, we don't want to know about it. It's our money, and they want to put in $24 million of our money and we don't want you to put it in.' I have had some very strong representations. My response has been to say that we have got to explore every avenue in this industry that might offer something better for growers, that might offer better prices, reduced costs. It would be irresponsible of me as minister to close off that door before we have looked at it properly, fairly and objectively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have before us is a situation where this information paper is being prepared. In the meantime, the prospective partners are actively consulting with growers and other industry sectors, and there will be plenty of time and opportunity for comment on the proposal by the industry. I have made it quite plain that the proposal must demonstrate broad industry support prior to my considering it for approval. It must also, of course, comply with competition policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We as a government are not interested in something that reduces competition to the cost of wool growers. We want to increase competition; we want better results out of people vying to offer better services at reduced cost; and we want better returns based on more effective marketing, handling and storage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note very strongly here that the great concern of some growers that Wool International wanted to use $24 million of their money out of section 51 funds on a trial program has now been addressed by the reality that Wool International is no longer seeking to use that money. Instead, it expects to fund its share of the partnership through a privatisation offer. I think that that dramatically alters the parameters of the debate. Quite frankly, it confirms my instinct that it was appropriate to hold the door open on this option and continue to explore it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My department, in conjunction with Wool International and the Wool Council, is looking at related issues, including that of how to enable trading in the future equity of Wool International. Now the latter would be to enable early access to cash for growers. Remember that, in 1993, we were worried about whether we would ever make enough money out of the sale of the stockpile to cover the debt. Now we are looking at a substantial equity for growers, likely to be somewhere of the order of $2 to $2.50 return for every dollar in tax they have paid&mdash;do not quote me directly on that but I think those are the broad parameters. We are looking for ways to give growers early access to that through some system of trading of rights or trading of equity, and the idea would be to give growers as early a relief as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We, as a government, together with industry leadership, want to cooperate with anything that will help hard&hyphen;pressed growers experience some relief in the current very difficult circumstances. Let me note that those who have concerns about Wool International being some sort of self&hyphen;perpetuating dynasty can be reassured by the simple reassurance that it is our very strong view that Wool International should be liquidated, and I think it is broadly accepted that is what will happen. It is our intention to wind it up when it has completed its task.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, these amendments are the fruits of a comprehensive consultative process. They enjoy the enthusiastic support of the great majority in the wool industry, both here and overseas. I can tell you that the nature of the contacts in my office&mdash;correspondence received, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6900"> telephone calls and so forth&mdash;has changed dramatically since the round table, something that I certainly want to see continue. I have been very pleased to have played a part in this process by providing the industry with a round table forum which was able to deliver such a high level of agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This process, as I have said before, has demonstrated that all sectors of the wool industry can unite to come up with sensible, considered positions for the good of the whole industry in the longer term. It is important for us all now to focus on the very important priorities of how to encourage demand for wool and to increase our industry's efficiency and competitiveness with other natural and synthetic fibres on wool markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will remain ready to work closely with the industry to do whatever it can to improve access, to develop markets for wool internationally, and to pursue genuine reform in the domestic arena to improve the competitiveness and the bottom line outcome for Australia's wool growers, to whom I have a very deep personal commitment and to whom many people in this place share a deep commitment. The government is, in broad terms, fully cognisant of their current difficulties and the problems that will confront those communities if we do not turn the fortunes of the industry around very soon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many areas in Australia where, frankly, the only option is to grow wool. So it is not just the wool growers in those areas who are affected, who are going to be wiped out if we cannot turn this great industry around, it will be the communities that back them up and service them as well. This is, in my view, a national priority. It is important to us economically; it is important to us socially. We really have to do everything we can. But it is great, I think, that the industry is now in a very strong position to take forward those things which belong to it, to take hold of those areas of leadership that are most appropriately the industry's, at the same time as we as the government fulfil enthusiastically and with vigour our responsibility to help in those areas of research and development, broad economic reform and market access and negotiations.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I was interrupted yesterday by a division and the subsequent adjournment of the Main Committee in its debate on the Euthanasia Laws Amendment Bill 1996, I was very keenly impressing upon all and sundry that I do understand <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6901"> that, despite the improvements in the standards of our palliative care, despite advances in the technology in that area, there are those in our community who suffer unacceptable pain for unacceptably long periods of time. It does not sit easily with me that my decision to support the private member's bill will deny some of those people the right to access the Northern Territory's Rights of the Terminally Ill Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My position is not one I have taken lightly. Members of parliament have been inundated with information from various interest groups seeking to put their case in the last few months, and I have made the most of every opportunity to listen to them and have taken every opportunity to better educate myself on this issue. I also attended a seminar organised by the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese) and the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), at which a number of pro&hyphen;euthanasia speakers addressed the gathering, including Professor Peter Baume, who is the Professor of Community Medicine at one of the large Sydney universities and also a former federal minister for health; Dr Roger Hunt, who is a senior consultant in palliative care; and Dr Roger Marr, from the John Hopkins University in the United States of America. And still I remain far from an expert on euthanasia and all the legal questions that go with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are probably hundreds of people in my electorate who have a better understanding of euthanasia and palliative care and related issues than I do. No doubt there are thousands in my electorate who have had more experience with the terminally ill and the pain they suffer than I have. I thank the dozens of constituents who have written to me or contacted me by phone to express their views, often quite passionately. Many of them were making an effort to write to a politician for the very first time. Few of the written presentations were fancy but rather they were usually handwritten notes taken down, I feel, very soon after reading a newspaper article on the subject or hearing some television coverage of the subject or maybe talking to a friend in the street about the issue. It really is an issue that sparks emotion within most Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But nothing I have read, no&hyphen;one I have talked to and nothing I have seen has been able to quell my concern that, once you move to legalise the intentional taking of another's life, you open a Pandora's box. It is not possible for a piece of legislation to govern adequately all the situations which sufferers and their families find themselves in. Those who support euthanasia say that people should have a choice. I agree. Indeed, I could not agree more. My fear is that, once euthanasia becomes an option, they will feel that they have no choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am most concerned that people who have become a burden on their family and their friends will feel pressure, or even feel obliged, to choose the euthanasia option rather than continue to put their family and their friends through their own pain and suffering. The reality is that it is possible that family members with an unhealthy financial interest in a relative's demise could themselves put pressure on a patient to end his or her life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I raised my concerns with those who addressed the seminar here in Parliament House I was told, `We believe that in most cases that will not occur.' Mr Deputy Speaker, I believe that the overwhelming majority of Australians will agree with me when I say that `most of the time' is simply not good enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also possible, at least in my view, that, if future funding arrangements made it tempting, unscrupulous private nursing home operators could place pressure upon highly dependent patients to take the euthanasia option. I think questions as simple as `Do you realise what a burden you are now on your family?', placed at the right time&mdash;at a time when people <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6902"> suffering pain are quite emotional&mdash;could instil in them a feeling of obligation to request the euthanasia option.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To many Australians, euthanasia does seem a simple issue. To many it seems appropriate that people who are suffering unacceptable pain and who have been given no chance of survival should have a choice to end their suffering. But they do, effectively, have a choice now, Mr Deputy Speaker. The withdrawal of medical treatment which is sustaining a patient's life, including an intravenous drip or a respirator, is not illegal and occurs all the time. Similarly, doctors have a duty to provide whatever treatment a patient needs to ease their pain and suffering. This may mean increasing doses of morphine or other sedatives, even if this action in some way contributes to the patient's death. This is not euthanasia. These are simply acts which allow nature to take its course. By contrast, euthanasia is the use of a substance designed to bring about death intentionally. There is a very big difference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, once we allow euthanasia to become acceptable, what sort of commitment can we expect from governments in the area of funding of palliative care? How keen will the large pharmaceutical and research companies be to invest in research and development in the area of palliative care once the demand for their product starts to drop off because of the availability of euthanasia? How much do they now spend seeking an answer to diseases like malaria which usually are only prominent in Third World countries, where there just is not the money to purchase the drugs? Where will this leave those who have the desire to fight on, those who seek help, those who want to live, those who want to survive? Are we to become a society that has decided it is cheaper and easier to force people to press `yes'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now to the issue of state and territory rights. I note the presence of the member for the Northern Territory (Mr Dondas), who is very concerned about this issue. It concerns me that the bill seeks to override the will of a democratically elected legislature. However, I have to ask myself what is more important: the question of territory rights or the right of every person to be given a chance to live?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have legislatures to sustain life, to maximise the quality of life and to control those who seek to deny people those rights. For me, the choice between territory rights and life itself will always be very simple. To those who say, `This is a matter only for Territorians,' I simply say that there is such a thing as a one&hyphen;way ticket to the Northern Territory. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(12.46 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am speaking in this debate as I believe it is important that the people of Eden&hyphen;Monaro know exactly why I will not be supporting the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996. Firstly, I want to say that I have never advocated nor campaigned for or against the introduction of voluntary euthanasia. It is not a matter I have personally felt strongly about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do, however, have absolute respect for those parties who embrace a strong view on one or other side of this issue, but I do not believe this bill is the forum for a national debate on voluntary euthanasia. This bill does not address the issue of voluntary euthanasia at a national level. This might be the national parliament, but any or all of the six states of Australia could pass voluntary euthanasia legislation tomorrow, and this bill would have absolutely no effect on it. In fact, I read in today's newspapers that a euthanasia bill was being introduced in the South Australian parliament only yesterday. How can this be a debate about voluntary euthanasia for Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his second reading speech, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6903">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia cannot resolve a matter that goes to the life and death of its citizens, then what is the purpose of the parliament?</PARA>
<PARA>If the honourable member for Menzies believes that that is what he is doing with this bill, then I would suggest that he does not understand his own bill and he does not understand the Australian constitution. The states could legislate tomorrow on euthanasia and this bill would have no effect at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the objective of the honourable member for Menzies and other members supporting this bill is to prevent voluntary euthanasia legislation nationwide, then they should be attacking it in an entirely different way. Quite frankly, I wish they would, because out there in the electorate the perception is that this bill is the definitive statement on whether there can or cannot ever be voluntary euthanasia across Australia. Legally and constitutionally, that clearly is not the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this bill is seeking to do is to amend the Northern Territory (Self&hyphen;Government) Act 1978, the Australian Capital Territory (Self&hyphen;Government) Act 1988 and the Norfolk Island Act 1979. It is not a bill to directly wipe out the Northern Territory's Rights of the Terminally Ill Act; it is a bill to retrospectively say that the Northern Territory did not have the right to make that law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just think clearly about that for a moment, because I am not confident that everyone understands that, even some honourable members. Certainly, the majority of the electorate does not understand that. If all honourable members do understand that this bill will amend the self&hyphen;government acts of the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory, I doubt that many of them really understand the background and workings of those acts. Some might think it is irrelevant, but I would argue otherwise, and I will explain the importance of it in relation to this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As it is primarily the Northern Territory that is under attack by this bill, I will use it to demonstrate my point&mdash;plus I have had some experience in that part of Australia. Some people believe my opposition to this bill is based purely on the fact that I once lived in the Northern Territory for a few years of my career. That is not the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I point out to those people that I was born, bred and educated in Sydney, I lived and worked in England for a year, I lived and worked close to the Swiss border in France for nearly two years, and I have lived in another regional and rural part of New South Wales as well as where I currently live in Queanbeyan. I am uniquely placed because, having lived in the Northern Territory for a number of years, I can at least understand their position and can rationalise the issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the Commonwealth government granted self&hyphen;government to the Northern Territory in 1978, they gave to the Northern Territory parliament power to make laws over all matters, except four specific areas. Those four specific areas were: industrial relations, uranium mining, Aboriginal land rights and control over Uluru and Kakadu national parks. All other matters were the domain of the Northern Territory parliament. The Commonwealth, however, also included a safeguard clause. That safeguard was that the Commonwealth could reject any law within six months of the Northern Territory passing the law. That safeguard was not taken up by the previous federal government with respect to the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act. It was not taken up even in the face of strong representations by the anti&hyphen;euthanasia lobby.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of the honourable members now supporting this amendment to the self&hyphen;government act were in the parliament at the time, but they were silent on the issue. Many of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6904"> honourable members now supporting this amendment to the self&hyphen;government act were part of the government at the time, but they chose not to utilise the specific provision that the Commonwealth had. So why have they changed their minds now? I do not know, but perhaps one of those members might explain why when they debate this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I could, however, speculate and say that the general consensus at the time was that the Northern Territory had always acted responsibly since 1978 in the formulation of their laws, and therefore it was wrong to interfere. And they have acted responsibly. Never, since 1978, has the Commonwealth felt the need to utilise the `safeguard' clause, let alone change the self&hyphen;government act to take more powers away. They have not felt the need because the Northern Territory parliament has acted responsibly and in line with the wishes of the people they represent. If they had not, the people would have changed the government. But they have not changed the government since self&hyphen;government in 1978. In fact, they have not changed it since 1974 when the Legislative Assembly was first elected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So surely the proper test in considering this bill should be to look closely at the performance of the Northern Territory parliament since 1978. Surely that is a reasonable thing to do before we throw ourselves headlong into amending the self&hyphen;government act. Any reasonable analysis of their performance will result in a pretty good report card.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have been responsible, they have been democratic, they have governed for all. After 18 years of self&hyphen;government, the Northern Territory has developed into a vibrant economy and, in many areas, has become the envy of other parts of Australia. They have not only been responsible, they have also led the nation in some critical areas. For example, firearms legislation in the Northern Territory prior to the Port Arthur massacre was accepted as being the second toughest in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Northern Territory has been the accepted leader in anti&hyphen;alcohol abuse programs. Through their living with alcohol program, over a five&hyphen;year period alcohol statistics have changed dramatically. For instance, light beer sales have gone from one per cent of the market to 28 per cent. There has been a 26 per cent reduction in the number of alcohol related road fatalities and in road accidents overall. This is a program that has been picked up elsewhere in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another example is the Northern Territory's recognition of Aboriginal customary law in the Northern Territory legal system. This progressive model is being followed and considered by other jurisdictions. I could provide many other examples of progressive, landmark legislation in the legal and social justice areas which are being hailed nationally. My purpose in providing this information is to indicate that the legislature of the Northern Territory has acted responsibly. Its parliament has followed the democratic process in the passing of all of its legislation. The topical act in question, the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act, was no different.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth does not have the power to reject that piece of legislation directly. The time in which the Commonwealth did have that power has passed. So now the only way to do it is by amendment to the self&hyphen;government act. Given the history, given the detail of what has occurred, given the proper procedures that the Northern Territory parliament has followed, I believe it would be the height of arrogance for us to now intervene in another parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My resolve not to support the bill before us is strengthened by the fact that this bill does not address euthanasia at a national level. As I said earlier, any state could introduce legislation tomorrow and this bill does nothing to prevent it. The only way for the federal parliament to have control of this issue is by way of referendum. After receiving volumes of correspondence and representations, I fully understand that there are very strong personal views at both ends <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6905"> of the euthanasia debate. The two extremes are insisting I represent those views. How can one person represent both views? One person cannot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are ever to address this nationally&mdash;and I repeat that this bill does not&mdash;it has to be given to the people. I do not support referenda willy&hyphen;nilly, but on this intensely personal issue it could be the only fair way. I reject this bill as it is an unfair attack on a democratic parliament, and it does not address voluntary euthanasia nationally. Thank you.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I would like to express my appreciation to the many people who have spoken to me or taken the trouble to write to me or telephone me to let me know their views on Kevin Andrews's private member's bill, the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996. I thank also those who let me know their views on the Northern Territory's legislation on euthanasia, as well as their reasons for opposing or supporting euthanasia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a credit to this parliament that this important debate is taking place in a manner that affords respect to the views expressed by each member. It should not be surprising that a bill like this which seeks to deal with the very way our society values life should attract the support of members of the government and the opposition. This is not to question the sincerity or the good intentions of those from all parties who have chosen to oppose the Kevin Andrews bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only sour note is the decision of the government to refuse to allow all but six speakers in this debate to speak in the House of Representatives chamber. The rest of us have been relegated to this small committee room which has only limited space for members of the public, or members of parliament for that matter. The decision also denies radio listeners around the country an opportunity to listen to one of the few debates where the debate may influence the outcome and where the outcome is unknown. A debate about whether euthanasia should be allowed to be practised in Australia is important enough for the House of Representatives chamber, not `sideshow alley', as this room has been affectionately and accurately described.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning to the Kevin Andrews bill, let me begin by addressing the constitutional questions. No&hyphen;one questions that the federal parliament retains the legal right to make laws for the territories. Granting self-government to the ACT or the Northern Territory or Norfolk Island does not prevent the national parliament from setting the laws of the territories. For example, if one of the territory assemblies enacted a law to allow capital punishment in that territory then I believe the national parliament would have the right, if not the obligation, to overrule that law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the record, I would have preferred that the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly would never have passed its legislation legalising euthanasia in that territory, and having been passed I would have preferred that the Northern Territory's euthanasia legislation should have been repealed by the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clear that there are some members of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly who are not prepared to vote to repeal this bill, even though they personally may be opposed to euthanasia. There has been some recent speculation that they would prefer that the High Court strike the legislation down. As I said, my preference would be for the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly to repeal the bill but if it does not have the votes or the courage to repeal the law, then it is my view that this parliament has the right to intervene.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the central core views of our society is the high value we place on life. We can see it in the joy of birth, we can see it in the pain we feel when someone close to us dies, we can <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6906"> see it in the public anger which can erupt after a murder and the severe penalties which our society imposes on those who commit murder. We can see it in the lengths our community will go to to save a life, whether it be the resources we devote to trying to save someone who is critically injured or the many acts of valour performed by people who place their own lives at risk to try to save the life of another. Euthanasia undermines this central element of our humanity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to distinguish euthanasia from other ethical and legal ways of providing palliative care to people with terminal illnesses. Patients have the right to refuse treatments that prolong suffering. Families and doctors can withhold or discontinue life&hyphen;prolonging treatments. For example, if a person's brain functions have ceased but that person is being kept alive by a machine or intrusive procedures, it is legal to allow that person to die by turning off the machine. The South Australian parliament has codified the common law right of a doctor to legally provide pain relief, even in circumstances where providing medication to relieve pain may risk shortening life. Clearly, the intention of a doctor in those circumstances is to relieve the suffering and not to put an end to life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to quote from the second reading of the Consent to Medical Treatment and Palliative Care Bill in the South Australian Legislative Assembly on 26 November 1992 when Mr Martyn Evans, now the honourable member for Bonython, made the following remarks in introducing the bill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What the Bill does seek to ensure is that a medical practitioner will not incur liability by administering a medical procedure for the relief of pain or distress if he or she acts with the appropriate consent, in good faith and without negligence, and in accordance with proper standards of palliative care, even though an incidental and unintended effect of the treatment is to hasten the death of the patient.</PARA>
<PARA>I would also like to quote an extract from the catechism of the Catholic Church which has been sent to me by one of my constituents. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2279<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Even if death is thought imminent, the ordinary care owed to a sick person cannot be legitimately interrupted. The use of painkillers to alleviate the sufferings of the dying, even at the risk of shortening their days, can be morally in conformity with human dignity if death is not willed as either an end or a means, but only foreseen and tolerated as inevitable. Palliative care is a special form of disinterested charity. As such it should be encouraged.</PARA>
<PARA>Euthanasia is very different. The Northern Territory legislation allows a doctor to terminate a patient's life by giving him a lethal injection. The intention is clearly to end life. Once society crosses this threshold it is very difficult to know when to stop.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In future, will a doctor be allowed to terminate the life of a young person if they are believed to have a terminal illness? What about a person of any age who wishes to commit suicide? Or what about a person who suffers from disability? There was an example in one of the papers this morning of a quadriplegic with an incurable illness, but not a terminal disease. How will we ensure that elderly people do not feel under pressure or under some unstated obligation to consider euthanasia because of the impact of the cost of hospital treatment or the cost of aged care on their family's assets or their children's inheritance? For all these reasons I will be voting in favour of Kevin Andrews's bill to overturn the Northern Territory's euthanasia legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from striking down this legislation, something positive can flow from this debate. These days most Australians have access to good quality palliative care. Unfortunately, some other regions&mdash;including the Northern Territory&mdash;need more resources to ensure every <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6907"> Australian has access to this essential care if we or a member of our family or community are unlucky enough to need it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recent budget regrettably broadbanded, then reduced by 10 per cent, federal funding for palliative care and some other health payments to the states and territories. I accept that no government has access to unlimited resources. But it is hard to think of a more worthy cause than to extend a helping hand to a person who has a terminal illness. And it is hard to think of a more worthy cause than to extend that helping hand to that person's family and friends whose only wish is to ensure that he or she can die with dignity.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Claims that new medical practitioners in WA will be unable to practice medicine are without foundation. There is no reason why any medical practitioner who wishes to do so will be unable to practice medicine. The Budget measure limiting Medicare access for new medical practitioners will only affect a very small proportion of WA medical students. Most medical students will continue to gain access to training places offered by the RACGP and specialist colleges. The handful of new graduates not going on to post graduate training will be able to work in salaried positions such as those offered by public hospitals, government, the armed forces, pharmaceutical companies <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6914"> and academia. Available figures indicate that there are large numbers of vacancies in these areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) In January 1996 the Australian Medical Workforce Advisory Committee issued a report providing medical workforce benchmarks in respect of all medical disciplines including general practice. On page 21 of the report the Committee concluded that overall WA had an oversupply of 163 general practitioners (ie 13.9%). By comparison the oversupply in NSW and Victoria was 20.5% and 17.7% respectively. The fact that shortages remain in certain areas is a problem common to all states, including NSW and Victoria. These shortages are particularly common to rural areas and public hospitals and reflect the maldistribution of the medical workforce rather than an overall shortage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The rural locum support program operating in WA is heavily subsidised by Commonwealth Government funding. Funding for this program has continued in this year's Federal Budget. Furthermore funding for such services is likely to increase by virtue of $20m additional funding per annum being made available as part of the budget measure aimed at redressing the maldistribution of medical practitioners. In addition, I have recently announced that continued access to Medicare will be available to new doctors working for approved rural locum programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) It is difficult to envisage why any state would  be disadvantaged by these changes&mdash;particularly as they are likely to result in a substantial improvement in the distribution of the medical workforce. Furthermore the provision of $20m pa to assist in the redistribution of the medical workforce is likely to produce substantial benefits for rural areas in all States including WA.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) There are a number of technologies available for the detection of unexploded munitions, including magnetic resonance, magnetic flux, ground penetrating radar and infra red and thermal imaging. Once detected, unexploded munitions can be uncovered and destroyed or rendered safe using a variety of means, for example with explosives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Most clearance procedures used on the Gulf War battlefield dated from World War II. However, improvements are being effected for both battlefield and non&hyphen;operational clearance, mostly in relation to methods of detection.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)&hyphen;(4) No definite rate of detection or clearance costs and timings can be provided as these depend on the type of munitions, how it was delivered, its size, the soil conditions and the detection and clearance equipment used.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) There is always some level of risk to personnel in dealing with unexploded munitions. The risk is related to the type, size and condition of the munitions and the nature of the land. The level of competence of personnel involved in any operation is also a factor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) The depth of clearance is dependent on the size of the munitions, soil type and other environmental factors, and the type of clearance equipment used.</PARA></ANSWER></ANSWER.TO.QON></ANSWERS.TO.QUESTIONS></HANSARD>
