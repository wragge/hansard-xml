<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Has the Prime Minister seen a letter in yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS>  from a Sydney mother who wrote:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was extremely concerned and ashamed when my six&hyphen;year&hyphen;old son returned home one day from school to proudly tell me he had told an Asian classmate to leave Australia. When I asked him how he could say something like that he replied, `That's what that lady on TV said.'</PARA>
<PARA>Has the Prime Minister also seen reports of comments by the New South Wales upper house Liberal member Mrs Helen Sham&hyphen;Ho calling on the Prime Minister to make a strong statement supporting the Asian community and cultural diversity because after living here for 35 years she felt quite personally attacked by the views of the member for <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Oxley? Will the Prime Minister now agree it is time for him to exercise leadership on this issue and state clearly and unequivocally that the member for Oxley's views on racial issues are hurtful to a great many Australians, are damaging to our interests in the region and do not reflect the kind of society that Australia is or wants to be?</PARA></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="4857" SPEAKER="Howard, John, MP" NAMEID="ZD4" ELECTORATE="Bennelong" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Prime Minister" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a serious question from the Leader of the Opposition, and I hope the House will enable me to give it a serious response. Can I say in answer to the Leader of the Opposition, no, I have not seen the letter to the Sydney <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS>  but I have no reason to doubt that the Leader of the Opposition truthfully referred to it. Have I seen the remarks attributed to Mrs Sham&hyphen;Ho? Yes. Have I generally followed the debate? Yes. Do I have a few things to say about it? Yes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say at the outset that I do not believe it is appropriate for the Prime Minister of this country or senior political figures in leadership positions on either side to define the policies of the government or the party by reference to a maiden speech of an Independent member of parliament. However, seeing that you have given me, by this question, the opportunity of saying a couple of things, I will do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might remind the Leader of the Opposition that I have already forcefully restated the non-discriminatory character of Australia's immigration policy. I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that I did so when asked a question about it on the highest rating current affairs program in Australia, and a report of those remarks was carried as a lead item in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper and all around this country in other newspapers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me take the opportunity of saying to the honourable gentleman that the Liberal and National parties will yield to nobody, no political force in this country, in our commitment for racial equality and racial tolerance. Let me make it very clear to the Leader of the Opposition that, no matter what arguments there may be about immigration policy in this country, once a person has come to this country that person is entitled to the respect <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that is due to every other Australian irrespective of that person's background.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my view there should be robust debate in this country about the size of our immigration policy. People are entitled to attack the present immigration levels without being branded as bigots or racists. That was the point that I made in my speech to the Queensland division of the Liberal Party. I also made another point which my detractors have sought to ignore, and that is that people who exercise free speech have an obligation to do so in a sensitive and caring fashion. That has always been my credo. I make no apology for that. But it has also been my credo that, if someone disagrees with the prevailing orthodoxy of the day, that person should not be denigrated as a narrow&hyphen;minded bigot. That is basically what has been happening in this country over a very long period of time. It has been happening&mdash;</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Denison interjects. When you had people who dared to disagree with your version of how to handle Aboriginal affairs, when you had those people being branded as racists and bigots, then you have a perfect demonstration of the sort of McCarthyism that was creeping into Australian politics under the leadership of the former Prime Minister. McCarthyism was creeping into Australian politics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can remember early in 1992 when unemployment went to a very high level, and the minister at that time was the current Leader of the Opposition. The former opposition leader, John Hewson, and I both called for a reduction in the overall level of immigration because of its link with the level of unemployment. For our pains, we were bucketed by the former Prime Minister as racist. He actually used that expression. That is the kind of behaviour that I regard as absolutely unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me return to the first part of the honourable gentleman's question. I will always denounce racial intolerance. I will always defend the non-discriminatory character of Australia's immigration policy. I believe that the contribution that Australians of Asian descent have made to this country has been <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4858"> immense. I want to place on record, as I have on numerous occasions, the high regard in which the Liberal and National parties hold Australians of Asian descent. They have brought to this country many skills, they have made a contribution to our society and they have brought their commitment to individual freedom, their commitment to small business and their commitment to the strength of the extended family. They have brought those values with them and they have made a valuable contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have said that on numerous occasions. It passes very strange that the Leader of the Opposition and those opposite&mdash;this is the party, after all, which has made a sleazy preference deal with the Australians Against Further Immigration; Graeme Campbell&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government a couple of months ago made some changes to Australia's immigration intake and to Australia's immigration policy. Those changes were made in the national interest. It was the view of the Liberal and National parties that for too long under the former government immigration policy was not driven by the national interest but driven by the desire of sections of the former government to unduly placate vociferous sections of the Australian community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have introduced a new approach to immigration, but a cornerstone of that new approach is that the policy remains absolutely <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> non&hyphen;discriminatory. That is our policy, that has always been our policy and it always will be our policy, because it is morally and economically and politically in Australia's interests that we maintain an absolutely non-discriminatory immigration policy. I have enunciated that on numerous occasions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might say to the Leader of the Opposition that a couple of weeks ago I visited Jakarta and Tokyo. In the latter city, after meeting the Japanese Prime Minister and attending a news conference which was attended, so I am advised, by a record number of local media representatives for an Australian Prime Minister, not one question was addressed to me about Australia's immigration policy. The reason one was not addressed to me is that it is accepted in countries such as Japan that a non&hyphen;discriminatory immigration policy is now and has for many years been a bipartisan given of Australian politics.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HV5">Mr WAKELIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister will recall that during the election campaign he promised to make the Native Title Act more workable. I therefore ask: what action is the government taking to amend the Native Title Act to ensure that Aboriginal communities, pastoralists and miners can operate with greater certainty? Will the amendments ensure that there is greater focus on providing benefits for those directly involved rather than simply providing new avenues for lawyers to continue arguing?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="4858" SPEAKER="Howard, John, MP" NAMEID="ZD4" ELECTORATE="Bennelong" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Prime Minister" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that during the election campaign we made a number of commitments in relation to this issue. Let me remind the parliament that they were, firstly, to retain the Native Title Act; secondly, that we reserved the right to amend the Native Title Act to ensure its workability; thirdly, that we promised to respect the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act; and, finally, that we would ensure that any amendments to the Native Title Act were preceded by wide consultation. I am happy to inform the House that the further amendments to the Native Title Act, which were approved by the government parties this morning, comply in full with those four commitments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4859">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These amendments are the result of very extensive consultation. We remain committed to retaining the Native Title Act, but we want to make it more workable for the benefit of all people affected by it, and we will do this in a manner that completely respects the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act. We have, as I am sure all members interested in this subject know, undertaken very extensive consultation with all of the groups that are concerned and involved. We want to achieve a fair balance between the legitimate interests of government and industry and also the interests of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of proposals included in the amending bill introduced into this House at the end of the last sitting occurred after extensive consultation with a wide variety of interest groups. Further extensive consultations have been undertaken since that time on the contents of the bill in the three major areas that were not covered: firstly, the right to negotiate; secondly, the role of representative bodies; and, thirdly, the recognition of agreements with native title holders about mining and other development activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the right to negotiate, that process will be streamlined in the new amendments to ensure that it is only necessary for a mining project to go through the process once and that negotiations with native title holders for that purpose focus on the actual impact of the mine on their native title. To prevent a repeat of the Century situation, the Commonwealth Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs will be able to ensure that a project of major economic benefit to Australia can proceed if it appears that that benefit will be lost if a decision is not made urgently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The registration test is being revised to prevent a repetition of the situation where multiple claims are made over the same area and registered without satisfying any real test as to the likelihood of establishing the existence of native title. Tightening up of the mediation provisions will address the practical problems which arise when a claim is made over a large area, such as the case in the Yorta Yorta claim in the Murray region, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which is now under way in the Federal Court with its 400 respondents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are also important amendments relating to representative bodies and voluntary agreements. The details of the amendments will be available in the form of an exposure draft. I believe these amendments will contribute significantly to a more positive and cooperative approach in the area of native title. The parliamentary secretary, Senator Minchin, who has assisted me in these matters, will be releasing a detailed statement and the details of the exposure draft this afternoon.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4T4">Mr MELHAM</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister endorse the statement by his Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs on the separation of Aboriginal children from their parents when he said, `What we must recognise is that a lot of people have benefited by that'?

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity which the member for Banks has given me to say something about this. I start by telling him that the government does not in any way endorse the separation practices of earlier generations in relation to Aboriginal people and at no stage, according to my understanding of what he said, has Senator Herron ever said so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="LATHAM" NAMEID="K26">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="K26">Mr Latham</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Oh! He did not endorse it?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He asked me quite a serious question and I take him seriously because he treats his job a little more seriously than some of his colleagues on the front bench. According to my understanding, Senator Herron never said that. In fact, in the interview which was the basis of the story in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  he described the practice as horrific. Yet in all the reporting that has gone <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4860"> on since, in all the comments that have been made about him and in all the criticism that has been levied against him, there has been no attempt to acknowledge the fact that the comment he made in relation to his understanding of what particular individuals had said to him was against the background of having regarded the practice as horrific. If we are interested in accurate debate on this issue, if we are interested in a fair assessment of what people say and what they contribute to the debate, I think that ought to have been acknowledged.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I take the opportunity of saying of Senator Herron that he is a person for whom I have an immense personal regard. He has my complete confidence. I think the contribution that Senator Herron has made to the relief of suffering of less fortunate people in this world far exceeds that of most people on both sides of this House. I really think there should be a rather more careful examination of what the man really said before people hop into him in wild, misguided situations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the inquiry which was established by the former government, it is true that, as the press reports, I wrote to the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory in July, saying that the government had reservations about the practical benefit of the inquiry. That was not the first time I had given voice to that discussion. In fact, in a meeting between myself and Mr Michael Dodson, the Social Justice Commissioner of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission which was held on 22 April this year&mdash;only about seven weeks after the government had been sworn in&mdash;he raised the question of the inquiry into the separation of Aboriginal children. I will read from the record of the meeting which was compiled not by a member of my staff but by the deputy secretary of my department. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The chairman had written to the Prime Minister about terms of reference and financial difficulties. The Prime Minister said he could not give any commitment on funding and there was a question in his mind over the long&hyphen;term value and practical contribution of the inquiry. He stood ready to meet Mr Wilson and Commissioner Dodson before a final decision was made on future funding. He was not unsympathetic, but the coalition did not have <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the same attitude to the issue as the former government. Commissioner Dodson spoke of the circumstances of those affected, the importance of this issue and the injustices encountered to understanding today's problems for the indigenous community. The Prime Minister said he understood the intensity of feeling, but even people of goodwill may form the judgment that there was not a lot to be gained from an expensive inquiry on long past policy.</PARA>
<PARA>I think those practices, by the standards of today, whatever your politics are, would be quite unacceptable. I have absolutely no doubt that they caused immense trauma and immense unhappiness to the people concerned. I have, equally, no doubt that it is always a difficult exercise in our kind of society to impose the standards and attitudes of today on the conduct of yesterday. I think it is also fair to say, although it is probably, in the current climate of debate on these issues, difficult to do without being jumped on, that some of the people who were involved in the maintenance of those practices genuinely at the time believed that what they were doing was right. I think that must be borne in mind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The view that the government takes is that the additional resources that might otherwise be devoted to this inquiry, additional to those that were devoted under the decisions of the former government, would be better employed in contributing towards improving health, education, housing and employment opportunities of Aboriginal people. That is a legitimate point of view. It is not an insensitive point of view. I have a completely sensitive understanding of the feelings of the Aboriginal community on this. But I do not apologise for the fact that we have a different policy on this issue from that of the former government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things that ought to be understood about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs is that the policy of the former government and the policy of the new government are different. The commitment of the new government to the welfare of Aboriginal people is not less than the commitment of the former government, but our way of achieving that commitment is different. We do not make any apology for that, and we never will.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to this idea that some group of politicians in Australia, namely, those who <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4861"> belong to the Australian Labor Party, have a monopoly on concern and compassion, do you know what makes the Australian people angry about Aboriginal affairs? The fact that for 13 years you spent hundreds of millions of dollars and the condition of the indigenous people appears no better. That is what makes people all around this country very unhappy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just have to say again to the member for Banks, and I say again to the Leader of the Opposition, when it comes to concern about the welfare of disadvantaged Australians&mdash;and I have said this repeatedly&mdash;of all identifiable groups in the Australian community none are more disadvantaged than the Aboriginal people. That is why in this budget there is provision in relation to health and housing and all those other things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not going to cop a situation that, just because we do things differently, every time we announce a change in policy that gives a rhetorical licence to those on the other side of this parliament and others in the community to brand us as insensitive or racist. The days of that kind of smearing are over. That was the significance of what I had to say to the Queensland division of the Liberal Party. We are simply not going to cop any more of this phoney moral outrage from the Australian Labor Party.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. I am sure all members of the House will join with me in congratulating Professor Doherty who becomes the third Australian citizen to win the Nobel Prize for medicine and the fourth Australian born. He joins Howard Florey, John Eccles and Frank Macfarlane Burnet. Professor Doherty started his career in veterinary science with the Queensland government. He went overseas and did his doctorate and did his early research in the sheep disease scrapie.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dr Rolf Zinkernagel is a Swiss scientist who came to the ANU to do post-doctoral studies with Professor Doherty. Together they were looking at properties of cells in the body and the response of the immune system. What they discovered was that when a virus infects a cell of the body a protein on the surface of that cell changes and that leads to the development of the body's response to the foreign virus. This formed the basis of a number of vaccines that are in use today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to think that this seminal piece of research was published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lancet</EMPHASIS> in 1975 when Peter Doherty was 34 and Rolf Zinkernagel was only 31. Professor Doherty left Australia in the late 1970s and came back between 1982 and 1988. Then he went overseas to further his studies at the University of Tennessee in Memphis. He has received a number of awards, including the Fellowship of the Royal Society of London and the Paul Ehrlich prize for medicine in Germany.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member also asked about biomedical research in Australia. I think that this, our fourth Nobel Prize, shows how incredibly strong we are in biomedical research as a country and how this is something that has lasted over a long period. I am pleased to tell the honourable member that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4862"> funds for the National Health and Medical Research Council were not cut in any way. We did not even seek to take an efficiency dividend from them. In fact, the amount of money we will be providing in this and other years is increased over and above the forward estimates.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure honourable members will understand that details are still emerging about what happened in Queensland last weekend. I do not want to say anything that in any way may affect the apprehension of those people responsible. That said, I can say a few things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand the substance known as Fantasy, which caused the illness at the nightclub in Queensland, probably contained a substance called sodium oxybate. It is called sodium gamma hydroxybutyrate. Sodium oxybate is an anaesthetic agent that is available and used in Germany and France. It is not a registered therapeutic good and no approvals for its registration have been sought or given. For this reason, importation of sodium oxybate into Australia for supply to others is an offence under the Therapeutic Goods Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand the chief health officers of Australia are going to be meeting on 14 and 15 October. They have jurisdictional responsibility for action regarding sodium hydroxybutyrate. They will be looking at this as a matter of urgency, and I certainly endorse this response.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This morning I received a letter from the Queensland health minister, Mike Horan. He <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4864"> talked of the threat that he sees from Fantasy in his state, particularly given that the end of school is coming up. I will be replying to him and I will be telling him that the Commonwealth will cooperate with his government in any way that is possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am aware that the Queensland health minister has made comments about the importation of sodium oxybate, but as a good that is not registered under the Therapeutic Goods Act its importation is effectively prohibited now. But I am prepared to look at supplementary options, including prescription only use in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure all honourable members are concerned about the popularity of these party drugs and what little is known about them amongst young people and how what is happening on the Gold Coast may reflect what is happening in other parts of Australia. As with all drugs that are the subject of abuse, it is important to try to balance supply side measures with measures that will minimise harm and measures on the demand side as well. The availability of gamma hydroxybutyrate, or Fantasy, by my department is being considered a matter of urgency by the TGA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have an education strategy under way, called the `dance party project'. That is targeting particularly young people in nightclub venues. It was looking at Ecstasy, not Fantasy, and it is planned to be released later this year. I have asked my department to change this project so that it can include information on a variety of other drugs, such as Fantasy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The medium term measure that we can look at is putting in place a collaborative approach to ensure that this sort of entertainment, which is going to continue, is at least legitimate and undertaken safely. To this end, protocols are going to be considered at the Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy in March next year.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Indi for his question. I understand that it is very important to him and the people in his electorate as well as very important to the people in the Deputy Prime Minister's electorate of Farrer. The Murray is currently experiencing high water levels as a result of recent rains and some moderate downstream flooding has occurred. It should be noted that those current water levels have been reached or exceeded during 10 of the last 30 years&mdash;most <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4865"> recently just four years ago. The Murray Darling Basin Commission has advised that the additional releases from the dam will not result in increased flows of water above the current level, but that the duration of the flooding which will exist will be extended for some period of time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am assured&mdash;and I know this is of real concern to the members involved and people who live in that area&mdash;that the shift which has occurred in the dam wall is not the result of the recent high water levels. In fact, a program of investigations and remedial works at Hume Dam has been under way for a number of years. We did announce in the recent federal budget that we would be providing $5.9 million over the next three years for the necessary works to be undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cost of construction of the Hume Dam was, in the first place, contributed to by New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia as well as by the Commonwealth. Under present arrangements, the New South Wales Department of Land and Water Conservation maintains the structure pursuant to an agreement with Victoria and the storage in accordance with directions from the Murray Darling Basin Commission. It is a split responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recent work carried out on the dam has revealed movement of some five millimetres in the core wall at the junction of the concrete spillway and the main embankment. Following an engineering report by the New South Wales constructing authority, it was felt that the work should begin without delay and that the water level should be reduced by two metres in the next two weeks and by a further three metres by the end of the year. That would substantially increase the safety margin from the current 15 per cent to around 35 per cent. Fifty per cent is regarded as the normal accepted benchmark for dams in general.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am assured by the commission that there is no immediate cause for concern. They are taking the precautions of lowering the water and bringing forward the remedial works to ensure that the dam meets contemporary safety standards. I am advised that a detailed community information program is currently being developed.</PARA>

The way they would do it is by taking $1 billion off expenditure over the next three years. If you took $1 billion off expenditure over the next three years, you would find the situation where, in order to balance, you would need an additional $3.4 billion in 1997, 1998 and 1999. Where would that $3.4 billion come from if it were not coming from expenditure reductions? It would come from new taxes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me give the House some idea of some of the new taxes that would be required under Labor to achieve a balanced budget. To get $3.4 billion, you would have to increase personal tax rates on low income earners from 20 per cent to 23 per cent, a three percentage point increase, or a 15 per cent increase in the marginal rate. To get $3.4 billion, you would have to increase the sales tax by five percentage points: the 12 per cent rate to 17 per cent; the 22 per cent rate to 27 per cent; and the 32 per cent rate to 37 per cent.

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4K6">Mr CAUSLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. Given the difficulties young people in my electorate are facing gaining a real job following the failure of the economic policies of the previous government, can the Minister outline what action this government is taking to assist school leavers in finding full-time employment?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="4867" SPEAKER="Kemp, Dr David, MP" NAMEID="BT4" ELECTORATE="Goldstein" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Schools, Vocational Education and Training" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BT4">Dr KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Page for his question. I know that he is very concerned about the difficulties that young people in his electorate have found in getting jobs over the last few years. No group in the Australian community was more seriously disadvantaged by the failures of the previous  government in economic management than school leavers. The fact is that Labor essentially deserted school leavers. The 65 per cent of young people who were not going on to university or full-time study in TAFE had very few options before them apart from the dole.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the former government introduced the Working Nation program and told young people that they were going to get jobs, there was absolutely no shift in teenage unemployment over the whole period of Working Nation&mdash;from its introduction until the election. Youth unemployment had skyrocketed up to 32 per cent during the recession caused by the previous government. The apprenticeship scheme was left to wither on the vine. The number of young people in apprenticeships and traineeships was at the lowest level for three decades.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is putting into place policies which will create real job opportunities for these young people by keeping taxes down, by getting small business moving, by <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4868"> bringing the budget back into a responsible balance. We are reviving and putting new life into the apprenticeship system. We are bringing small businesses in the local communities and schools close together for the first time in a century. We are bridging the gap between communities and schools in a way that the previous government was never able and never prepared to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week I announced the first school based traineeships under the government's apprenticeship reforms. Under these school based traineeships, students will be able to combine their secondary school certificate with a nationally recognised qualification in office administration, leading to careers in management, marketing, sales and accounting. New school based apprenticeships are on the way, and they will be here as soon as the opposition passes the workplace relations legislation in the Senate. Young people will be able to have the opportunities that are presently being denied to them by the Labor Party, fully in accordance with this long tradition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week I also announced details of the jobs pathway program, for which the government has allocated in the budget some $5.9 million in funding over the next two years. We will be contracting with job brokers to help secure employment and make the connections between students doing vocational education courses in schools and local employers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the recent budget, the government set aside $187 million to expand vocational education in schools. We have entered into an historic alliance with the secondary school principals of Australia. We will be working on a working party with secondary principals right around Australia to make sure that these opportunities which the previous government failed to deliver will be delivered to the 30 per cent of young people who are leaving school before year 12. Australia's young people hold the key to the future of this country, and this government is going to make sure that school leavers have a clear and solid pathway into employment and quality training which they were denied by the previous government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. In view of the previous government's failure to address the problems of illiteracy and declining numbers of apprenticeships, can the minister outline to the House what reforms have occurred in policies regarding literacy and vocational education in schools since this government came to office?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="4870" SPEAKER="Kemp, Dr David, MP" NAMEID="BT4" ELECTORATE="Goldstein" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Schools, Vocational Education and Training" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BT4">Dr KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Sturt for his question. There is of course a dramatic difference between this government and the previous government in addressing some of the key educational issues facing young people. When this government came to office, the first consultation we held with major business organisations indicated that illiteracy and lack of numeracy skills were the biggest single obstacles to young people getting jobs after 13 years of the previous government. I have already commented on the decline in apprenticeships and traineeships as a proportion of the work force, and of course hardly any progress at all was made during the period of the previous government in providing vocational education opportunities for young people in schools.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose in the minds of many members of the House the questions that arise are, `Who was responsible for policy in this area? Who was responsible for the vast policy vacuum in the Labor Party?' The answer is the previous minister in that government for schools, vocational education and training&mdash;none other than the previous member for Lindsay, the Hon. Ross Free. Ross Free gave new meaning to the notion of transparency in policy. He was totally invisible; the invisible minister.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BT4">Dr KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just let me detail some elements of this policy vacuum represented by the former Labor member for Lindsay. As the apprenticeship opportunities for young Australians declined, he uttered the word `apprenticeship' only 10 times in this House in three years&mdash;that is three times a year. The parliament was fortunate if he managed to address literacy in this House three or four times a year, if he cared to do so, and he addressed the issue of numeracy on only four occasions in this House over the whole three years. Civics education and vocational education rated barely a mention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that this former minister turned invisibility and policy lassitude into an art form. It is no wonder that on 2 March the voters in Lindsay decided that he should disappear. When you tried to turn up the contrast to see him, you realised it was already on high.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The time is indeed right to move forward in our relationship with France. Importantly, Foreign Minister de Charette and Prime Minister Juppe agreed that our relationship had great potential for growth and progress. Foreign Minister de Charette noted that my visit `allows us to turn the page and write new ones'. I can only agree with those sentiments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are positive foundations to build on. Our trade relationship is a good one, as is our investment relationship. We have a long history of cooperation in international affairs. The most recent example of that was the cooperation between Australia and France to bring about a comprehensive test ban treaty, which was open for signature in New York on 24 September.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do have very extensive people to people contacts with France. While I was in Paris, I took the opportunity of raising with the French government the establishment of visa-free travel for Australians in France. I know the requirement to obtain a visa to visit France is a significant irritant for Australians who want to go to that country, be it for business or pleasure, and many of course do. The French government, in light of the introduction of our electronic travel authority, is giving consideration now to providing visa-free travel for Australians into France. I very much hope that that will take place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final point I would like to make is that Australia and France do have mutual interests in our own respective regions. France is a welcome and valued partner of Australia in the Pacific, and I think there is further scope for cooperation. I also welcome France's growing interests in the economies of the Asia-Pacific and the fact that many French companies are now using Australia as a base for their Asia-Pacific operations. Given that France is a significant member of the European Union, our work with France in that context too is of great use to us and I think is of value to our bilateral relationship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, Mr Speaker, after what you might call the down period of our relationship with France following French nuclear testing last year, that relationship is now on a very positive and a very sure footing.

Further, have you read media reports claiming that the ban on non&hyphen;child resistant cigarette lighters would lead to the greater use of matches, which allegedly are more dangerous? Do you agree with this assessment?</PARA></TALK.START><!-- <ERROR>Class: 1

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Hinkler for his question. For some time I have been concerned about the dangers of disposable cigarette lighters to small children. Since 1988 there have been 42 recorded cases of injury to children under the age of five linked to the misuse of disposable cigarette lighters. Last year alone two young boys died in Victoria in a house fire caused by the misuse of cigarette lighters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Earlier this year I was surprised to discover that no national safety standards apply to disposable cigarette lighters. The United States introduced mandatory child resistant safety standards some two years ago in regard to this product. At the ministerial council meeting in Darwin on 27 September, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ministers responsible for consumer affairs agreed with me that current arrangements are inadequate. A draft statement in regard to the products will be released for comment later this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, as the minister responsible for Customs, I can inform the House that the importation of such non-child resistant lighters will be prohibited from 1 March next year. Ministers agreed that, in addition to that, the sale and supply of non-child resistant lighters will be banned from 1 July 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am aware of the claims that one importer has made that a ban on the sale of non-child resistant lighters will lead to greater use of matches. I reject that argument. In fact, that argument is not supported by the facts. I thank the member for Hinkler for his question. The danger that disposable cigarette lighters currently pose to small children is of concern, and the government has acted on that matter.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I will be tabling in parliament today the Commission of Inquiry report into the Relations between the Civil Aviation Authority and Seaview Air. This inquiry was established following the crash on 2 October 1994 of Seaview's Aero Commander VH&hyphen;SVQ, with the loss of all nine lives on board. This inquiry highlights how a litany of lies and incompetence led to the deaths of nine people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report is a damning indictment of the CAA and reveals Seaview as an unsafe organisation, a slipshod and often wilfully non&hyphen;compliant organisation in which breaches of regulations and unacceptable practices were commonplace. The report found that the aircraft was significantly overloaded and that the pilot's licence was not valid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The flight in question was estimated to be overloaded by between 261 and 288 kilograms. That is the equivalent of three adult <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4877"> male passengers in an aircraft whose maximum capacity was nine passengers. Even on the most favourable calculation to Seaview, the extent of the overloading was estimated to be some 220 kilograms. The commission found that Seaview's pilots regularly overloaded aircraft primarily due to the subtle but unmistakable pressure exerted by Seaview's management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And where was the regulator? The safety watchdog? Despite repeated warnings, Seaview was allowed to continue to fly. On 13 January 1994, the district airworthiness manager at Coffs Harbour, Mr Bob Hoy, urged the suspension of the company's air operators certificate. On 16 April that year he went to Canberra to see the then chief executive of the CAA, Mr Doug Roser, to press his concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet his warnings were ignored. Mr Hoy was trying to do what he was paid to do and what the public expected of him&mdash;ensuring the safety regulations are complied with. He insisted on standards and he was right to do so. Yet he was perceived by his superiors as being out of step. He subsequently suffered persecution within the organisation. The report shows how, as in the Monarch case, the CAA had placed commercial considerations ahead of the safety of passengers. The commission found:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In its efforts to please and appease industry, the management of the CAA, and certainly those who managed Mr Hoy, seemed to regard standards set by the regulations and orders as negotiable. In the face of a determined operator, such standards were sacrificed or moderated in order to neutralise a complaint.</PARA>
<PARA>Aviation is not like any other industry. When operators break the rules and when those people entrusted by the public to keep the skies safe don't do their job properly, innocent people lose their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Seaview's Aero Commander crashed into the Tasman Sea en route from Williamtown to Lord Howe Island&mdash;a flight which should never have been allowed&mdash;nine people lost their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Honeymooners Leeca and Anthony Atkinson were setting out on the first day of their new life together. Reg and Pam Drayton <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> were setting out on what was for them a second honeymoon; Stephen and Carol Lake and two of their five children, Judith and Benjamin, were setting off on a family holiday. The report paints a picture of the young pilot, Paul Sheil, as also being a victim of this unsafe organisation. These are the tragic consequences of wanton operators and an incompetent and timid regulator. They are not just statistics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report I will table today specifically looks at the appropriateness of decisions and actions of officers of the CAA and Seaview in the discharge of their responsibilities, and the effectiveness of the management and communications systems of the CAA as they related to Seaview.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The commission has made a specific recommendation that papers be referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions in order that consideration may be given to possible prosecutions. On legal advice, I will refrain from naming individuals about whom the commission makes specific recommendations lest it prejudices any future legal action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The commission also recommends that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority should, having regard to the evidence before the commission and its own investigation, take disciplinary action where appropriate. The commission identified lying and covering&hyphen;up by staff within the former CAA, as well as by people involved with Seaview. There could be no more fundamental criticism of the behaviour of the regulator. The integrity of those individuals in positions of responsibility is essential if the public is to have confidence in the regulator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report also makes a number of recommendations as to how CASA should carry out its regulatory role when faced with operators who deliberately or repeatedly flout the rules, or compromise safety and appropriate levels of surveillance. The commission strongly supports the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Plane Safe</EMPHASIS> report recommendations on providing better information to consumers on the nature of airline operators in different sectors of the industry. The commission also makes specific recommendations in relation to:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4878">
<PARA>&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the appropriate level of delegation for the issuing of an air operators certificate,</PARA>
<PARA>&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> employment selection processes for safety inspectors which emphasise and identify candidates with integrity and strength of character,</PARA>
<PARA>&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the use by one operator of another's AOC and cross hiring arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA>The commission makes important recommendations in relation to the vital roles of the maintenance controller and chief pilot in the running of an airline. The commission reminds Airservices Australia of the need to ensure its officers monitor the progress of flights strictly in accordance with the specified procedures and that from time to time independent inspections of Air Traffic Services groups be carried out to ensure uniform high quality operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to remember that this report provides only a snapshot of the behaviour of the regulator and the operations of just one small airline. The parallels with the Monarch case are obvious. The CAA was warned that Monarch was flying in breach of safety regulations and yet failed to act on a recommendation from an airworthiness inspector that Monarch's air operators certificate be either revoked or suspended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his report on the Monarch crash released in June this year, the coroner spoke of an atmosphere of intimidation of officers who sought to take such action and he concluded that had CAA management paid more attention to the law and less to accommodating its `customers', then Monarch would have been grounded and those deaths avoided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> In July last year, the commercial air traffic services operations of the CAA were placed with a government business enterprise, Airservices Australia, and the safety regulatory functions vested in a separate statutory authority, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. But changing the name does not solve the problems. While there have been some worthwhile changes, particularly at Airservices, I am not satisfied that sufficient change has taken place within the safety regulator. I expect, and the public will demand, that CASA take strong and swift action in re sponse to the recommendations of Commissioner Staunton.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I reiterate my concerns about the lack of aviation experience on the board of CASA. Since their appointment more than 12 months ago, I am not aware of the board having made any serious attempt to change the culture of CASA, and I cannot think of a CASA non&hyphen;executive board member having ever addressed an industry meeting or conference outlining a vision for reform of CASA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a need for strong leadership and a knowledge and understanding of the industry by board members to enable them to keep ahead of the bureaucracy. I remain dissatisfied with the performance of the board in this regard and this report reinforces the importance of appointing to the board of CASA strong individuals with relevant aviation experience and the drive for reform. The role of the board is to lead and not merely rubber stamp or monitor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In light of my concerns developed through my investigations into the Monarch disaster, and now equipped with the findings of Commissioner Staunton, I am totally convinced that substantial change within CASA is absolutely essential. This can best be achieved by having in charge of CASA a board with appropriate skills and relevant experience. I appreciate that individual members of the present board are highly qualified in their respective professions. But, just as it has taken them years of diligent effort to gain those qualifications, it will also take them years to become aviation experts. The millions of Australians who climb aboard an airplane each year can't afford to wait for them to gain that expertise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4879"> It is for this reason that I repeat my request for them to step aside; to enable people who are expert to take charge; to implement change; to make CASA a better safety regulator; to make flying safer. I am not empowered under the legislation to remove board members who lack appropriate skills. As the minister responsible, I am required to assure the safety of the Australian public. And yet I cannot state that I have confidence in the skills of the board to ensure that their statu tory responsibility to protect the travelling public is carried out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find this personally distressing, particularly when I know there are many fine and capable people within the Civil Aviation Safety Authority who are desperately awaiting the right leadership and vision from the board. I can only hope that Commissioner Staunton's report will have sufficient impact to motivate the board to resign and make way for others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will table this two&hyphen;volume report with the knowledge that the tragic events that took place involving Seaview Air in October 1994 occurred despite warnings that I made in this House in May 1994 about this specific airline's operations. Those warnings were quite clear and can be summarised by the following statement I made about Seaview in parliament on 4 May 1994 which indicated that `this airline, which was operating so dangerously and which was putting people's lives at risk, continued to fly'. It gives me no satisfaction to know that those concerns were subsequently, and most sadly, proven correct. The parallels with the Monarch tragedy in 1993 are all too evident. Once again, here was an operator who, despite showing all the signs of breaching regulations and who should not have been flying, continued to fly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again we had a safety regulator that, instead of taking decisive action against safety breaches, acted indifferently and, even worse still, went out of its way to ensure that the airline continued to fly. Commissioner Staunton described it as the `institutional timidity of the CAA'. The commissioner's summation of the former CAA's oversight of Seaview was `in three years it did very little and discovered almost nothing'. No statement could better sum up the absolute incompetence of the CAA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since its commencement on 25 October 1994, the Seaview inquiry process has been a long one, with extensions of time required to allow the commission to complete its inquiries. The inquiry had 142 witnesses, received over 900 exhibits and sat for 224 days of hearings and produced almost 17,000 pages of transcript. The financial cost, in the order of $20 million, takes no account of the huge emotional cost and strain on the friends <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and relatives of those lost in the accident as the commission's hearings unfolded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On behalf of the government I wish to thank Commissioner Staunton and his staff for the enormous amount of work they have done over nearly two years and for providing such a detailed and comprehensive report. They have at times shown enormous patience. Commissioner Staunton has highlighted the following areas of concern which he believes warrant further consideration:</PARA>
<PARA>&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> an attitude that characterises breaches of the Civil Aviation Act, regulations and the orders as `aviation trivia';</PARA>
<PARA>&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> a practice of cross&hyphen;hiring that enables an operator to use an aircraft of a type not endorsed on the AOC by `borrowing' the AOC of another operator;</PARA>
<PARA>&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> a practice of pilots overstating flying hours in their log books so they might accumulate more quickly sufficient hours to obtain work with large operators;</PARA>
<PARA>&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> a suggestion there is widespread disregard by general aviation maintenance organisations for manufacturers' requirements;</PARA>
<PARA>&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the adequacy of pilot training;</PARA>
<PARA>&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> allowing a pilot with only a few years' experience to pilot aircraft alone&mdash;while carrying passengers&mdash;when he or she has little more than the minimum required hours for endorsement on the aircraft type;</PARA>
<PARA>&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the maintenance release system for recording flying hours is unsatisfactory;</PARA>
<PARA>&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the concept of district offices, where there are few operators and few officers, raises the issue of `capture'; and</PARA>
<PARA>&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the adequacy of the regulatory authority's information about operators and pilots.</PARA>
<PARA>Not surprisingly, many of the key findings and recommendations in the commissioner's report complement the conclusions of two previous reports on aviation safety. In December last year, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure conducted an extensive inquiry into aviation safety, particularly in the commuter and general aviation sectors. As a member of that committee, I can honestly say that it revealed a number of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4880"> aviation safety issues which had been left alone for far too long in these sectors of the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The result of the committee's work was the release of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Plane Safe</EMPHASIS> report which identified the following four key features of aviation safety:</PARA>
<PARA>&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the absence of robust indicators on the safety of aviation or the performance of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority;</PARA>
<PARA>&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the paucity of information on low capacity RPT and the general aviation sectors;</PARA>
<PARA>&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> an inadequate approach to those sections of industry that exhibit the characteristics of destructive competition; and</PARA>
<PARA>&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> rampant distrust between the regulator and certain sectors of the industry and within CAA/CASA itself.</PARA>
<PARA>The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Plane Safe</EMPHASIS>  report went on to make a number of recommendations, many of which have already been acted upon by the government. While I will be announcing the final government response to the report in the very near future, I can indicate today that in a number of key areas, such as consumer information, safety indicators and corporate planning, work is already well advanced to put into effect many of the specific recommendations of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Plane Safe</EMPHASIS>  report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The release of the Monarch coronial inquiry report in June this year also focused attention on a number of issues related to air safety and aviation insurance. Back in May 1994, I had reported in parliament my absolute disgust at the fact that the grief and pain suffered by the families of those killed aboard the Monarch aircraft was compounded by their being denied access to insurance. As I said then:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Insurers apparently use every means to evade their liability and are unmoved by the distress of the families or victims.</PARA>
<PARA>An insurance policy was in existence then, but the airline's breaches of regulations were being used by the insurer to escape liability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More than three years after the Monarch tragedy, the relatives and families of those who died are still waiting for acknowledgment and settlement of their claims against the insurer of the operator. I would be appalled if <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this disgraceful situation were to recur in relation to the victims of the Seaview disaster.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the Monarch and Seaview accidents, we have seen the introduction of mandatory insurance for airline operators and no&hyphen;fault payouts by their insurers, with a significant increase in the limit of compensation payment to $500,000 per passenger. Amendments to Commonwealth carriers liability legislation and regulations affecting domestic and international flights to and from Australia became effective from 20 January this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government expects and strongly urges all the states to have their complementary legislation to cover all intrastate flights in place by the end of this year. I have said before that most regional and commuter airlines serving rural Australia maintain a high standard of safety and, having spoken to many reputable regional operators in recent years about these accidents, I can assure the community they are just as concerned about anyone in their industry who brings the sector into disrepute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The owners of all passenger airlines have a primary responsibility and duty of care to ensure that their passengers are carried in well&hyphen;operated and well&hyphen;maintained aircraft. It is not a duty that can be left to one individual such as the chief pilot or the maintenance controller, although each of these office holders must, in the performance of their duties, always put the safety of the passenger first. Therefore I believe that owners should also be held equally liable. Commissioner Staunton's report has clearly shown that Seaview's owner was not up to meeting these fundamental responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have written to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority Director of Aviation Safety, Mr Leroy Keith, seeking his written assurance that a charter operator, Kentia Link, which may have connections with the former Seaview Air, is now, and has been since its inception, under full and appropriate safety surveillance, including ramp checks and any other audit or operational inspections necessary to ensure compliance with the requirements for its continuing status as a charter passenger carrier. I have asked Mr Keith to inform me which officer is accountable for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4881"> ensuring that Kentia Link complies with the air safety regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">CASA staff from here on in will be held accountable for their actions. The role of CASA in oversighting this sector of the aviation industry has to be addressed. CASA is reviewing the safety of low capacity regular public transport operators and their support organisations through programs such as the safety systems assessment of passenger carrying operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In June this year, following the release of the Monarch coronial report and foreshadowing the need for reform following the Seaview inquiry, I announced the most far&hyphen;reaching safety regulatory review in this country's history, with the establishment of a complete overhaul of civil aviation regulations and a close examination of the role of CASA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This review will be overseen by a program advisory panel, reporting directly to me each month. The review is about achieving outcomes capable of implementation and is not another committee or forum for just discussing safety issues.</PARA>
<PARA>The panel has been drawn from the most senior and distinguished levels of the aviation industry and will be chaired by Mr James Kimpton, the Manager of Aviation Policy at Ansett Australia, and the immediate past chairman of the Australian Air Transport Association.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of the other representatives of the panel, who come from a diverse cross&hyphen;section of interested parties, I am most pleased to have John Laverick, the father of one of the Seaview victims and a person who has taken up with considerable and admirable determination the consumer issues arising out of this accident.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is looking towards all major industry organisations and leaders to support the regulatory review process and for CASA management to work with the advisory panel in a positive and constructive manner. The government expects that the regulatory review will produce substantive recommendations next year which could be implemented in 1998.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There needs to be a clear understanding that the review of itself will not solve all CASA's problems. It will help, but I return to my earlier point: the best way to solve these problems is to have a board that is capable and expert, coupled with a determined government, working with industry to produce an effective safety regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former CAA has been the subject of strong and adverse comments in both the Monarch and Seaview accidents. Thirteen years ago, it was criticised by Sir Sydney Frost QC, who had inquired into the Advance Airlines crash that killed 13 people in 1980. The failures of the then regulator, the Department of Transport, are remarkably similar to those highlighted by the Monarch and Seaview disasters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The time has come for CASA to respond to these recurring criticisms of aviation safety regulation through rebuilding its reputation by taking appropriate action against those who bring the aviation industry into disrepute, including its own staff. I will be insisting on a full and detailed response from CASA and the full cooperation of the CASA board, management and staff in ensuring we move forward to a more effective and efficient system of air safety regulation in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My aim as the minister responsible is to foster and promote the shared safety goal. The government is determined to achieve it. The travelling public expect nothing less from the government and, through it, the safety regulator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is nothing, however, that will bring back to life the victims of the tragic Monarch and Seaview accidents. My heartfelt wishes go out to all the relatives and friends of those who lost their loved ones in these two disasters. I am determined to ensure we learn the lessons from their deaths to save other Australians from a similar fate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recommend that this report be compulsory reading for all CASA staff. It will highlight to them how easily things can go wrong and how dire the consequences can be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I table the two&hyphen;volume report of the Commission of Inquiry into the Relations Between the CAA and Seaview Air. I ask leave to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4882"> move a motion to authorise the publication of the report.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I first wish to join the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) in expressing my sincere condolences to the families and friends of those involved in the Seaview disaster, and in commending Commissioner Staunton for his work in investigating the causes of this disaster.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The conclusions that Commissioner Staunton has reached with respect to the Seaview disaster can perhaps best be summed up in the phrase that appears a couple of times in his report: `the institutional timidity of the former Civil Aviation Authority'. It is quite horrifying when you read through the list of non-compliance by the operator and read the things that were permitted to occur because of the failure of the CAA officers to take action when they should have taken action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They include the case of a flying operations inspector who failed to conduct appropriate inspections; who took excuses at face value from the operator for defects; who was aware of the fact that an illegal regular passenger transport operation was being flown and did nothing; who, when complaints were received from the chief pilot of Seaview, actually disclosed the identity of the complainer to the operator when he raised the complaints with the operator; who failed to investigate problems that had been raised with the CAA by customers through complaints; and who presided over the upgrading of Seaview to regular passenger transport status, in spite of all the obvious things that were wrong with the operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there was the regional manager who failed to adequately supervise the flying operations inspector and wrongly imposed restrictions on another inspector who, quite <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> properly, was seeking to point to the deficiencies in the Seaview operation and the failure of supervision that was occurring. There were also more senior officers who had been asked by the then CEO of the CAA, Mr Doug Roser, to do a proper audit of the Seaview situation in response to complaints, and who failed to do so not on one occasion but on two occasions. It would appear that Mr Roser failed to follow up his own request in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The conclusion reached by Mr Staunton was that `CAA saw its role as satisfying the customer rather than regulating the operator'. The factors that appear to have led to the disaster include: the flight was overloaded by at least 260 kilograms; the pilot may have been affected by antibiotics that he was currently taking and possibly analgesics; the pilot did not have a current medical clearance, his previous medical certificate expired some three weeks previously; and, perhaps most significantly, the flight plan provided for a flight altitude of 12,000 feet which was ignored in spite of the obvious icing risk which was the subject of a prohibition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some background points that I will make which are relevant to the minister's response today. The first is the battle that the minister has engaged in with the CASA board since he has become the minister and which he reiterated today in his comments on the report. Very early in his term as minister he asked by letter, by telephone and in a meeting the CASA board to resign. This was despite the fact that they had only been in office for nine months and had not taken office until some considerable time after both the Monarch and the Seaview disasters. His reason for doing so, which he reiterated today, was that they lacked relevant aviation experience. The board comprises: Mr Justice Fisher, who is the chief judge of the Industrial Court of New South Wales; Mr Geoff Molloy, a retired Qantas pilot; Ms Clare Pollock, who is a systems safety expert; and Ms Gabi Hollows, a consumer advocate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has more or less implied in various public arenas that the role of the CASA board is very much hands on and that it more or less checks the planes itself. The <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4883"> real role of the board is to ensure compliance with the act. Its responsibilities include legal, accounting and management issues as well as aviation issues. It administers the organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has submitted legislation, which has gone through the House but not the Senate, to extend the size of the board by two and to create a deputy chair position in order to partially achieve the objectives he set himself. There has been wide speculation that a strong financial supporter of the coalition in its last election campaign, Mr Dick Smith, the former president of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, would be one of the two appointees. This is speculation that Mr Smith has certainly fostered and the minister has done nothing to quell.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a ministerial statement on 25 June, which today's statement reflects and does not greatly add to, the minister claimed that the board of CASA had been putting its own interests ahead of the interests of aviation safety in Australia. That is a very strong and serious charge. He did not produce any evidence to support this claim other than their refusal to accept his request to resign. The chairman of the board, Mr Justice Fisher, then put out a press release denying this accusation, as I think he was entitled to do. The minister then put out a press release in response to Mr Fisher's press release accusing him of a lack of loyalty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leaving aside the obvious peculiarity of a minister engaging in a war of press releases with his own statutory authority head, the fact remains that the minister has been inappropriately targeting the board of the Civil Aviation  Safety Authority for matters that it cannot be blamed for because it has only been in office for a relatively short period. The path the minister is proposing to follow cannot be seen as the solution to the problems that are manifestly apparent from both the coronial inquiry into the Monarch disaster and the report that he has tabled today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This rather cavalier approach to the administration of safety regulations can also be seen in the minister's approach to the matter of electronic locator transmitters. This is a very complex issue. There has been a very lively <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> debate on this between CASA and particularly AOPA as to the respective merits of fixed ELTs as opposed to hand&hyphen;held ELTs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The best that can be said with respect to this debate is that neither is universally better than the other in terms of safety. There are some situations where it would be preferable to have fixed ELTs and other situations where it would be preferable to have hand-held ELTs. It is worthy of note that when the minister overrode CASA's advice mandating fixed ELTs&mdash;which was in line with the International Civil Aviation Organisation's standard&mdash;and requiring them to allow hand-held ELTs as an alternative, the general manager of flying operations at CASA, Mr Holger Von Muenchhausen, wrote a memo to his superiors on 16 May 1996 which stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decisions are detrimental to the safety of survivors of aviation accidents and do not have the support of technical specialists within the flying operations branch.</PARA>
<PARA>As I have expressed before, I sincerely hope that we are not in this House at some point in the future examining a report from a coroner which concludes that somebody has died in a search and rescue situation because there was no fixed ELT in the aircraft. If that is the case, it will be on the minister's head because he has overridden his own safety experts and imposed a different decision on them, running very strongly the agenda of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association and Mr Dick Smith.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no better illustration of the extent of his association with the AOPA agenda than the recent fiasco surrounding the regulatory review that the minister referred to in his comments today. As indicated, he appointed an 11&hyphen;member program advisory panel to oversee the review of civil aviation safety regulations. This panel is representative of the different elements within the industry. It elected Mr David Wiltshire, the chair of the Aviation Industry Council, as its chair. The minister rejected this and said, `No, I want Boyd Munro from AOPA as the chair of the program advisory panel.' When this was made known, Mr Munro sent out a fax on 17 September styling himself as the chairman of PAP. Many other industry representatives <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4884"> responded by saying that they would not work with Mr Munro and they rebelled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 19 September, Mr Munro sent out a fax, calling a crisis meeting at Tullamarine airport. In it he stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CASA has managed to stuff it&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the PAP, the Program Advisory Panel&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">full of people who sing the CASA song.</PARA>
<PARA>And also:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As an industry we have licked CASA's boots for years and CASA has responded by kicking us. The boot licking approach has been well and truly tried and has well and truly failed.</PARA>
<PARA>On 20 September, the day after, we had backdown No. 1 from the minister when he issued a press release stating that Mr James Kimpton from Ansett would now head the Program Advisory Panel. The minister stated in the press release:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have asked Mr Boyd Munro to chair the Regulatory Framework Advisory Committee.</PARA>
<PARA>A few days later, on 26 September, we had backdown No. 2 when Mr Munro was demoted from the main panel to be chair of one of the subsidiary panels. The press release stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Captain Bill Hamilton, the technical director of the Aircraft Owners' and Pilots' Association, will chair the Regulatory Framework Advisory Committee.</PARA>
<PARA>In effect, the minister had tried to impose his own  favourites, representing a relatively small part of the total aviation industry, onto the critical process of industry consultation with respect to the aviation safety regulatory review. The industry rebelled, and the minister was forced to make a humiliating backdown.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does this tell the minister about what may happen if he does go ahead and appoints Dick Smith to the CASA board? What it should tell him is precisely what the opposition has been saying to him, that is, it will be a recipe for brawling within the organisation; it will be a recipe for major conflict and for the board becoming a battleground for competing factions within the industry; and, ultimately, very much not in the interests of aviation safety in Australia and not in the interests of passengers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should hasten to add that the Program Advisory Panel process and the consultation <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> process is commendable. There is a good spread of industry representation. I note in particular one appointment to the panel that is commendable, although it is somewhat at odds with the minister's attitude to the CASA board, and that is the so-called consumer interest advocate, Mr John Laverick. Mr Laverick's daughter was a victim of the Seaview disaster and he has taken a very keen interest in these matters. I applaud his appointment; I think it is a very worthy appointment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it does give rise to a question. Mr Laverick's title is `consumer interest advocate'. As I recall, that is a title that Gabi Hollows on the board of CASA also carries. This question occurs in my mind: why is it that, in the quite technical and complex process of reviewing civil aviation safety regulations, it is appropriate to have a consumer advocate represented, but it is not appropriate to have a consumer advocate represented on the board in the more general process, which involves other issues aside from technical aviation issues such as administration of the organisation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a core contradiction in the minister's position on aviation safety issues. He has taken a very strong position&mdash;and I think a commendable position&mdash;with respect to the disasters that have occurred and the fact that aviation safety regulation by the former Civil Aviation Authority was clearly at fault in that it should have been much more stringent, much less mindful of commercial interests and much more mindful of the interests of passengers and of the safety of the travelling public. But, in contrast to that, the minister has strongly identified himself with the very strongly deregulatory approach being pushed by Mr Smith and by AOPA as an organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The significance of this is nowhere better seen than in the comments of the coroner in the Monarch inquiry, Mr Peter Gould, where he actually attributed a significant degree of responsibility for the lax administration of the Civil Aviation Authority to its former chairman, Mr Dick Smith, for the so-called pro customer approach or the slack regulatory approach that the CAA had taken. There is an <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4885"> inherent contradiction in these positions, and at some point that contradiction is going to hit the minister in a very hard way. He is running with a deregulatory, affordable safety agenda pushing particular issues that ultimately will diminish the degree of aviation safety in this country, but at the same time he is making&mdash;appropriately&mdash;a strong play on issues such as the report we have before us today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will conclude with a couple of references to the statement that the minister has made today on the detail of the report. He repeats his call for the board of CASA to resign. He notes that the non-executive board members have not, to the best of his knowledge, addressed any industry meetings or conferences, which is hardly the basis for condemnation. I think there is a question mark as to what extent that really is their role. He states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a need for strong leadership, and a knowledge and understanding of the industry by board members to enable them to keep ahead of the bureaucracy.</PARA>
<PARA>That again raises the question: is it their role to second-guess technical advice or technical decisions made by the technical experts in CASA? I think not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister also implies that the board of CASA is somewhat to blame for the things which led to the Seaview and Monarch disasters. Quite clearly, it is not because it was not in place at the time when those disasters occurred. He then said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there are many fine and capable people within CASA who are desperately awaiting the right leadership and vision from the board.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, effectively implying that this is all the fault of the new board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. All the minister gives us, both on 25 June and today, as evidence in support of this is vague statements about the culture in the Civil Aviation Authority, as it then was, and with no supporting evidence about what is currently occurring. There is no doubt that change is required and that change is occurring. I have full confidence in the CEO of CASA, Leroy Keith; I know the minister has confidence in him. Why he sees the board as such an obstacle to that process of change, I do not quite understand.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most extraordinary thing about all of this is that last week in the media we were promised that we were going to have the world's greatest aviation safety statement this week and that all sorts of incredible things were going to occur. Yet all we have had today from the minister is simply the recycled attack on the CASA board, which is entirely off the point, and the reiteration of the Program Advisory Panel process with respect to the regulatory review. That has already been announced and explained to this House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is particularly peculiar in this response is that there is actually one very significant point of the Staunton recommendations with respect to the broader questions of aviation safety regulation, because the terms of reference were amended in about May 1995 requiring a much broader consideration of the general administration of aviation safety by the commission. Its response has been to recommend further inquiry on a whole range of issues with respect to aviation safety regulation including: the lax attitude to the importance of breaches of civil aviation safety regulations; the practices such as overstating of flying hours by pilots; the adequacy of pilot training; the significance of sole pilots being allowed to fly in spite of very limited experience; the adequacy of the maintenance release systems; and the structure of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we do have a recommendation which deserves some serious consideration, although there have been, as the minister mentioned, a number of inquiries, including the plane safe inquiry, that suggest that broader examination of these things is required. That also raises the question of why he can condemn the board of CASA&mdash;which was not in control and not in office at the time these disasters occurred&mdash;and what knowledge and what information he has on which to base his condemnation of that board and his cowboyish attempt to force them to resign over some months when his own inquiry, which he and I both commend, is saying that further examination is needed of these general questions about the future of civil aviation safety regulation and how CASA should operate. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4886"> Yet he sees fit to continue to attack the board without justification.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, very much for the opportunity to speak on the report today. I reiterate that I commend the work of Commissioner Staunton and reiterate my condolences to the families concerned.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That this House censures the Treasurer for the embarrassment he caused Dr Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, United States of America, by disclosing the contents of a confidential conversation on a highly sensitive matter; for the damage he has caused thereby to Australia's international reputation and credibility with senior decision makers; and for his subsequent persistent and deliberate attempts to mislead the public as to what he had done, in clear breach of his duty under the Prime Minister's Code of Ministerial Conduct.</PARA>
<PARA>It is no wonder that the government has used its numbers today to delay the bringing on of this matter and to ensure that the debate commences in a relatively empty chamber. It is no wonder because the behaviour of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in the United States last week has to be one of the most egregious and indefensible pieces of misbehaviour by an Australian minister in living memory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So much has been effectively admitted by the Treasurer today when in his first answer in question time, in his humble, chastised, pale and pasty mode that we last saw after the Premiers Conference debacle, he conceded that it had been inappropriate for him to comment on the subject matter of his discussion with Dr Greenspan and that it would not happen again. It was evident also in the Prime Minister's dash for cover in question time today, maintaining his record of effective silence on this matter that persisted through last week.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the case that no parliament could possibly rest content with this matter without proceeding to a motion of this kind, because what we have seen in the last week has been extraordinarily highly censurable behaviour in at least three ways: first of all, in breaking faith with Dr Greenspan, an official of the utmost significance, on an issue of the utmost sensitivity in breach of all rules of protocol and practice in international discourse of this kind, in a way causing immense damage to our credit, our reputation, our credibility and our access to senior decision makers not only in the United States but elsewhere&mdash;a folly that was compounded, of course, by the failure to apologise to Dr Greenspan, if indeed there has been a failure to apologise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not surprising, I suppose, that the Treasurer ducked and weaved, as did the Prime Minister, on this issue today, because if there has not been an apology to Dr Greenspan that only compounds the offence already committed. And if there has been an apology, of course, it makes absolute nonsense of the campaign of denial that has been maintained right through the last week that nothing was done or said of any public damage to Australia that needed that sort of response.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second matter at issue here is the initial denial of the Treasurer that he had said anything at all on the subject of Dr Greenspan's views, dismissing any such report as fanciful. Thirdly, after the tape was played, making that defence inoperative, he embarked on the extraordinary course of denying that he said what the tape makes clear he said on at least two further major issues. We have seen a move in the last few days from an initial appalling indiscretion to an appalling exercise in dishonesty, combined with a further appalling exercise in dishonesty and untruthfulness based apparently on a deluded assumption of invulnerability that he could get away with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us take each of these issues in turn. First of all, the initial indiscretion. It came to light with the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> front page article on 2 October, making it perfectly clear that the Treasurer was disclosing Dr Greenspan's views on a crucial issue <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4887"> or series of issues relating to the setting of the United States interest rates. The impact of that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> report was immediate. It was picked up by an AP&hyphen;Dow Jones reporter. It was flashed around the world and resulted in an immediate surge, sustained over several days thereafter, in the international bond market. The impact was described, for example, by Mr Haralabopolous, the Chief Economist of GIO Australia, in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He shifted the global bond market to the tune of many hundreds of millions of dollars&mdash;every debt in the world, private and corporate, you are talking billions of dollars of financial action.</PARA>
<PARA>Not only was this news in Australia, as Mr Costello tried to tell us, as reported on the AAP wires last week, but there was a flood of international responses to this disclosure. We were told that there was a flood of calls to Australia's Washington embassy by traders keen to confirm their accuracy. We are told by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">International Herald Tribune</EMPHASIS>  that bond prices rose in direct response to those comments. We are told similar things by the Knight&hyphen;Ridder report of that day. We are told that in a whole series of reports in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Wall Street Journal</EMPHASIS>  and other outlets, including the CNN web site, available internationally, which led with the brilliantly credible headline for Australia `Aussie gaffe stirs markets'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What was the reason that these comments, this report, had so much impact? The reason is not hard to discern. It is because the utterances of Dr Greenspan are watched as closely as those of the Pope. It is because, at the same time, Dr Greenspan is normally as inscrutable on these issues as the oracle of Delphi. He is in fact famous for a line that he uttered once to the United States Senate when he said to the senators, `If I have said something you can understand fully, then I probably made a mistake.' This is the way Dr Greenspan conducts himself in the public domain. He is not someone who believes in transparency; he is not someone who believes that it is appropriate for a central banker to lay out in the public domain every dimension of his current thinking on the issues that matter to his interest rate decision making.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Under those circumstances it is an extraordinarily significant matter for Dr Green span's views to be put into the public domain in this way. That, Treasurer, is simply in international affairs what you don't do. When you come out of a meeting with a senior figure of this kind&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="COSTELLO" NAMEID="CT4">

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Mr GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do indeed know because I did it for years without any problem of this kind. You state what you said, you don't attribute views to the other side unless you have the express or implied authority of the other party to do just that. You occasionally can generalise about the views that you have heard from a number of interlocutors, a number of parties; you can conclude as to the general pattern of a response on an issue in a country but never, ever without the authorisation&mdash;express or implied&mdash;of someone do you disclose the subject matter of those conversations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was not unexpected, as a result, that the reaction in the international sphere to this disclosure by the Treasurer was as severe as it was. The US Federal Reserve was very self&hyphen;disciplined in its response. It maintained what was an icy&hyphen;clear view by saying simply that the communication was a private matter and that Dr Greenspan did not comment on private meetings. They left it at that but the message was unmistakable and I do not think that anybody, even the Treasurer, mistook it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Others were less constrained in the way they expressed themselves. At question time I quoted from David Blitzer, the Chief Economist for Standard and Poor's, who was saying that this was `not the thing to do if he wants his telephone calls returned', and there would be `a huge storm if the United States Treasury Secretary had done anything like that'. We heard on the airwaves Mr Josh Fineman, the Global Markets Economist with Bankers Trust, saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is really kind of unique. I cannot remember a time where a foreign government official was quoted as saying he had a meeting with the Federal Chairman and the Federal Chairman suggested such and such about the economic outlook.</PARA>
<PARA>He then, with masterly understatement, said, `I don't think they would view this all that favourably.' Mr Bill Dudley of Goldman Sachs said this was considered `sort of bad <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4888"> form'. Was it ever! Of course, the Australian media was, as you would expect, less constrained in its assessment of the impact of this. You had the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>  saying `Costello gaffe echoes around the world'. You had the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  talking about `Costello's global gaffe', making no bones about the implications. Even Mr Kennett said, with the economy of expression for which he is sometimes famous, `The world now knows that Peter Costello is Treasurer of Australia.' And indeed they do! The editorials were absolutely devastating so far as the Treasurer was concerned. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>  in its editorial of 4 October referred to his `remarkably poor judgement'. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the episode leaves him looking naive and unprofessional, apparently disrespectful of the protocols that attend private chats with the world's most influential banker and&mdash;incredibly for an international Treasurer&mdash;insensitive to the fact that the slightest hint of Dr Greenspan's intentions can move the markets.</PARA>
<PARA>The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald&hyphen;Sun</EMPHASIS>  said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's reputation may well have been tarnished in the heady world of international banking. Will another banking chief share confidences with an Australian Government Minister?. . . It is not unreasonable to believe that on future trips to the US capital, Mr Costello may not be given access to the most informed and powerful man in the world's economy.</PARA>
<PARA>The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>  editorial of 4 October said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is probable that the gaffe will reflect on all Australian Ministers travelling overseas, at least for a time. The flow of information will not be as free, to the detriment of the national interest.</PARA>
<PARA>The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS>  editorial said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will be some time before anyone on the international scene trusts him again. He might as well stay home for the next few years, because no&hyphen;one of any consequence in international circles will confide in him.</PARA>
<PARA>In all of this we have seen a lot of speculation about the motives which might have led the Treasurer to go down this spectacular track, none more damning than the speculations of that person normally very sensitive to the role the coalition and the Treasurer play, Mr Michael Pascoe. On the Channel 9 <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daybreak</EMPHASIS>  program on 3 October, Michael Pascoe said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Peter, surely you were taught that a gentleman never discloses what he does behind closed doors with a consenting adult? Or were you just bragging a bit?</PARA>
<PARA>A few minutes later, on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Today</EMPHASIS>  program, Michael Pascoe said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Here's Peter Costello, his first time overseas, and it's a big time in the US, it is the IMF/World Bank meeting where they get to hang out with the big boys . . . It's certainly naive. . . It sounds, from the tape recording&mdash;we've all heard of it&mdash;a little like boasting, `I've been talking with the big boys, I'm the Australian Treasurer now.'</PARA>
<PARA>This is Michael Pascoe, your mate on Channel 9. Imagine what your non&hyphen;mates are saying. Michael Stutchbury summed it up beautifully in one phrase in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>  on 4 October when he referred to `this disastrous bit of big noting'&mdash;by a Treasurer who cannot help himself. Whatever explanation there may be for this appalling indiscretion, whether it was big noting or whether it was just naivety, whether it was ignorance of the protocols that attend these meetings or whether it was anything else, there is no doubt about the damage that has been done to this man's credibility and to Australia's credibility and reputation in any dealings we may want to have with world leaders in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we moved from the indiscretion to the denial of it, the dishonesty. His first reaction was to describe the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> report as fanciful. It is all there, spelled out, in the Dow Jones report of 2 October. It said that Peter Costello had called `fanciful' reported remarks that were attributed to him and made about US monetary policy. Mr Costello, when the Federal Reserve confirmed that he had met with Mr Greenspan on Monday, repeated a number of times that such a report was fanciful. He said, `I don't comment on US interest rates,' and when read a portion of the text of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> report, he said, `That's fanciful.' That particular defence did not last long because a tape had been taken of the meeting and Mr Costello not many hours afterwards was comprehensively sprung with the tape recording of the exchange. Let me put it on the record. It went as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Costello: On the record, okay. Questions? <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4889"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Journalist: . . . After speaking to Greenspan, what would be your expectation in the US, as far as interest rates go?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Costello: Well, I don't think there is any expectation at the moment that rates are going to rise.</PARA>
<PARA>A little later he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He indicated to me that he saw no threats to inflation down the track.</PARA>
<PARA>A little later:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So he indicated to me that there was no reason to expect a change on the current scene, as he sees it. . . he's very optimistic.</PARA>

No wonder the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the government's minders were speechless in the absolute absence of any credible defence. You need to explain why there was a minder in your own office or the Prime Minister's office or somewhere else in the government saying that the government's case was unanswerable on this. When the lights came on there you were `with your trousers down around your ankles'. That was the assessment, the characterisation, the understanding other people had.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The media editorial reaction in Australia all had available the full text, every sentence, every nuance, every huff, every puff, every grunt, every hiccup&mdash;they had the lot in front of them. Every single one of them was absolutely damning in their condemnation of your false denial of this matter. `Costello takes out fib of the week award' says the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>. In its editorial of 4 October, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The real problem is the impression that Mr Costello gave by denying the integrity of the initial report. If it is important for him to keep faith with Dr Greenspan, it is even more imperative that he keep faith with the voters who elevated him to a position of trust.</PARA>
<PARA>Again on 4 October, on the same theme, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  editorial said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By attempting to deny the undeniable, Mr Costello has made a bad situation worse . . . Mr Costello has done himself lasting damage . . . by his patent <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> ly untruthful response when taken to task about it . . . very hard for him to shake off the impression, which he himself has created, that in a tight spot he is all too ready to deal loosely with the truth.</PARA>
<PARA>As the editorials of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>  said, there has been a breach of trust with the Australian people. And a breach of trust with the Australian people is something that the Prime Minister told us was absolutely not going to be tolerated under the new whiz&hyphen;bang ministerial code of conduct. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ministers must be honest in their public dealings and should not intentionally mislead the Parliament or the public.</PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly what you have done and that is why you deserve censure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we had the further compounding of the untruthfulness. The saga did not stop there. We had the Treasurer in denial mode&mdash;`This isn't a tax, this is a tariff.' `This isn't a tax, it's a surcharge.' `This is a tariff, it's not a tax.'&mdash;as he was sprung successively with a further series of exchanges. `Were you saying something about US interest rates?' `Me talking about interest rates? Nothing of the kind.' But then the tape is played again and it is obvious that he is talking about US interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then again the further denial that he was not saying anything about Dr Greenspan's views. He was simply recording his own assessment. Then again we had, as was put on record in question time today, the exact quotes from that particular initial media briefing making it absolutely clear that he was doing absolutely nothing of the kind. One denial, two denials, three denials. The cock is now crowing for you, sport, just as it did for your biblical namesake before you. Three strikes and you are out in baseball. If there is any decency in this government, with all its pretences to decency in public affairs, then you would be out too. You would be right out on your ear and no longer purporting to be the Treasurer of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen all this before from the Treasurer. We have seen this extraordinary capacity for denial, bordering in fact on delusion when we see him in some of these modes&mdash;`This is not a tax, it is a tariff.' `This <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4890"> is not a tax, it is a surcharge.' `This is not a tax, it is simply a charge that is rebatable on conditions.' Whenever he is sprung clearly, directly, unanswerably with a statement of his on the public record, his mode is to retreat to denial and to do so in a way that is manifestly untruthful and seems to depend on some psychological assumption of invulnerability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I sometimes feel in these situations that he is not so much a suitable case for censure as a suitable case for treatment because of the way in which he responds. He thinks he can get away with all this because he sees himself&mdash;and this has been much remarked upon by every commentator in the country&mdash;as a new Paul Keating: confident, aggressive, flamboyant, carrying all before him in this parliament and elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trouble is that to do that, to play that particular role as another Paul Keating, you have to be good. You have to be not only experienced but you have to have ability; you have to have judgment; you have to have vision; you have to have integrity; you have to have respect. Let me tell you: I knew Paul Keating&mdash;we all knew Paul Keating&mdash;and, Peter Costello, you are no Paul Keating. In this Treasurer we have a down&hyphen;market, cut&hyphen;rate, discount house Paul Keating. We have a K Mart Keating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On all the evidence of last week; in all the appalling indiscretion; with all its appalling legacy for the reputation and the credibility of Australia overseas; with all its appalling implications for the accessibility of this man to high level decision makers for so long as he remains in office and seeks that access; with all that it reveals last week about his appalling untruthfulness in the original denial, the original dismissal of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> report as `fanciful', compounded and repeated to the point of pathological delusion with a whole subsequent series of further denials; we have someone who is demonstrably not fit to be Treasurer of this nation and manifestly deserving of the censure of this House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On few occasions would you see a censure in this House which was as weak as that and which aroused no passion. Where was the passion in the censure? With a censure you should at least be able to fix on some misdemeanour, you should be able to develop a credible argument, you should be able to disclose some new material.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we saw here somebody who is very obviously failing in his attempt to transfer to the House of Representatives and who stood up in order to try to justify himself to the troops who were all brought in here. What did the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans), do essentially? Essentially he read out a whole lot of newspaper articles from last week. He built to the crescendo of his speech, which was the cheapest imitation of Lloyd Bentsen I have ever seen. Do you remember the Lloyd Bentsen put down: `Mr Senator, you are no John Kennedy'? He built, as it were, to the great crescendo of a censure which was to say, `You are no Paul Keating.' Thank you; I could not have wanted a better conclusion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact the meanest thing you actually said in this censure, apart from all of those adjectives that you go on with as you read out the prepared text, was that I wanted to be a new Paul Keating. That actually did cut me. I found that to be the most devastating thing you said during the debate. When you came to your crescendo, the cheap imitation of Lloyd Bentsen, to say, `You're no Paul Keating,' all I could say was, `Gee, I've been cleared.' What a wonderful clearance we got from the shadow Treasurer in relation to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But let us try to get to the crux of the argument, because it can be dealt with very quickly. The guts of the argument from the opposition is that on sensitive matters of monetary policy in the United States you should not talk. As I said earlier, if that were in fact your charge, why do you get up and invite further comments right throughout question time? Why would you, except to try to keep flogging a dead horse? As I said in question time, I readily accept that you can put various interpretations on comments, and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4891"> that is why it is much better not to comment and I will not be commenting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But let us have a look at the parliamentary attack. How did the parliamentary attack on this moment of great principle develop? It developed on a separate subject altogether. You started off in question time today on the issues of Aboriginal affairs. That is how big this censure was&mdash;it was not even worth the first question; it was not even worth the second question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After this weak, lame performance during question time, having run out of questions, you tried to move a censure during question time. How did you finish up? You finished up with the devastating point, `Were you pot smoking?' That is how you finished up your parliamentary attack: `Were you pot smoking?'&mdash;undergraduate, juvenile humour. And now you try to make out that there is some kind of serious point to be gained here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point is that, if this was such a big moment, where is the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New York Times</EMPHASIS>? Where is the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Washington Post</EMPHASIS>? Where was the CBS newscast? Where was this international great event? The best that he could turn out was the CNN web site. `All over the place,' he says. Where is the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New York Times</EMPHASIS>? Where is the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Washington Post</EMPHASIS>?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was over in the United States and I decided that I would keep a reality check on all of the press. On 2 October the thing that was thought to be important in the United States was the National Association of Purchasing Management, which reported that its competent index of manufacturing activity fell to 51.7 for September, a lower reading than many economists had anticipated. As was said in relation to that, the National Association of Purchasing Management index of manufacturing activity was expected to come in at 53. It fell to 51.7 in September from 52.6 in August. It was said that a reading above 50 often signals an expanding economy; a reading below 50 signals a contraction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was the most significant news in relation to the markets on 2 October in the United States. But, of course, you would not know that, would you? Nor would you want to actually investigate it. Nor would you try <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to prove any significant effect in relation to these matters at all. This was the laziest, weakest and most inept censure that you will ever see in this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Someone gets up and reads out last week's newspaper articles. All of us can read last week's newspaper articles. We do not need a struggling, battling shadow Treasurer to stand up here and read out last week's newspapers. What we would like to know is some hard economic fact. But there was not even a pretence to try to put together any hard economic fact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other proposition that was said with great hilarity from the Labor Party backbench was that you would know what to do in international affairs. Let me let you in on a secret. It is almost like clockwork: when you walk into an international forum and you say that you are from Australia, the first thing that is always said to you is, `Oh, we are so glad Mr Gareth Evans is no longer attending these conferences.' It is almost like clockwork.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is generally somebody from the Asia-Pacific region. They come up to you and they say how glad they are that you are no longer on the international stage. It happened most recently again in Washington. They come up to you in a beeline and they say, `We are so glad there has been a change of government.' I must say to you that other ministers would have experienced this as well&mdash;that the best asset any Australian has on the international stage is not having the name `Gareth Evans'. This is the best asset that you can possibly have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This proposition that you can come into this parliament and tell us how to conduct international affairs is a bizarre proposition. We are finding out quite a bit about you on the international stage. We are finding out quite a bit about what you used to get up to. We are finding out quite a bit about how you conducted our relationships. Of course, we know that you were the master of discretion! You never made any comments about puppies, did you? No, you were the master of discretion; I am sorry! You were somebody who was fitted out to be UN Secretary-General. The only trouble is that the best you <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4892"> can do is the member for Holt, and you are not doing that very well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us come to some propositions that the Australian public is probably interested in. The Australian public is probably very interested in your plans for new taxes. The Australian public would be very interested to know what the Labor Party intends to tax and how. This will be a critical issue in the Lindsay by-election. The Labor Party believes that taxes are too low. The Labor Party believes, therefore, that taxes should be put up.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After the Labor Party disclosed this, you had to go to bed, sick. You said on the airwaves, `We believe that taxes are too low,' and you then went to bed, sick. As I said in question time, if I had done nothing else, I got you out of your sickbed. It was a bit like Lazarus: take up your bed and walk. I was very pleased to contribute to your rehabilitation, but that is about the only substantive or lasting effect that this will have had.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why don't you come clean in relation to your tax policy? I will tell you why: for you, this is a massive distraction which you want to use to take attention away from your taxation policy. I suppose it was so good that that is what got you out of your sickbed. Kim Beazley would have said, `We are back in business. Get out there and do whatever you can to build it up to take the attention off taxes,' because it is about taxes that the people of Lindsay are really worried. I venture to make this prediction: in the Lindsay by-election, the US bond rate is not going to be a major issue. I venture that proposition. I may be proven wrong, but I just have this inkling that in the by-election the US T&hyphen;bond rate is not going to be on the minds of all of the voters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now have an opposition that is trying to re-engage itself with blue-collar employees in Australia. The way in which they are going to re-engage themselves with the blue&hyphen;collar employees in Australia is by worrying themselves sick about the US T&hyphen;bond 30-year rate. I hope you keep this up day after day.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I noticed that the shadow Treasurer has called for my resignation. Let me make this pledge to you, Mr Deputy Speaker: we will never call for his resignation. He is right where we want him, and we want him to stay there as long as possible. But I must say that I am rather concerned, because there is one thing that is always an indicator of political mortality in the Labor Party, particularly the Victorian division of the Labor Party. Just as in the African desert a dead beast's carcass can always be located by circling vultures, in the Victorian branch of the Labor Party a dead political carcass can always be identified by ethnic branch stacking in an electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer of course to the fact that, in the electorate of Holt, Labor Unity has been shoring up its numbers by aiming at Bosnian, Albanian, Turkish, Cambodian and Vietnamese communities. This was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Oakleigh, Springvale, Dandenong Times</EMPHASIS>, which has catalogued the branch stacking in Holt in recent months. When the member for Holt was asked why his faction might be shoring up its numbers by aiming at Bosnian, Albanian, Turkish, Cambodian and Vietnamese communities, this is what he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think quite a lot of it has actually got to do with the fact that there is quite a strong migrant community down there, many of whom have some enthusiasm to be associated with the party now that I am here because of my foreign minister connections.</PARA>
<PARA>Very touching. Down in Dandenong all these Albanian, Bosnian, Turkish, Cambodian and Vietnamese communities are flocking in, limited to 13 per month in each branch, to join the Labor Party because of his foreign ministry connections.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said at the outset, just as the circling vultures disclose a carcass on the African savanna, so too do the warlords of the Victorian ALP disclose with their ethnic branch stacking a carcass that is in desperate need. But I do give this pledge: as I said earlier, on the basis of what the member for Holt has put in this censure motion and of his performance over the budget, we will never call for him to resign from that position. We believe that he has found his metier in that position, and we encourage him to continue just as he is.</PARA>

Sensitive they are, but he seems to be the only person in this place that does not think they are. He is trying to shift the onus and the burden away from everything that he said last week and is now trying to deny it. An indication of how concerned your side of the parliament is is the fact that you would not take the censure motion at the appropriate time. We all know that Peter Reith would love to have a censure moved against you. You talk about rivalry on this side. Let us talk about the sorts of developments between you and Penthouse Pete. He would love to have the censure motion moved against you, but in defence of the team the best he was prepared to do today was to delay it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> This is a debate that should have been held earlier today. It is one that the Treasurer has tried to run away from. His pathetic response to the first question from the shadow Treasur er was in particular the demeanour. Lost is all the cockiness, lost is all this repartee.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason they wanted to delay this debate and move it later into the day so that it would miss the listening audience and the news deadlines was that you are an embarrassment.

Secondly, on this occasion you betrayed a trust and then tried to cover it up.</PARA>

You say in your defence that in terms of that which you said various interpretations could be put on it. There is only one interpretation the market put on it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer does not understand how to handle it, Mr Deputy Speaker. He has been an enormous embarrassment in regard to this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two sides to this shameful episode. The first is the incompetence of the Treasurer in betraying that confidence and throwing the international markets into a spin, thereby causing acute embarrassment for this country. The second is honesty in public life. Either one of these would deserve a censure, but taken together they constitute a clear case for dismissal. I will come to the code of conduct of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the first matter, the behaviour of the Treasurer has been so appalling it is almost comic. If it did not have such a serious impact on our international reputation, you could almost laugh it off. Tongue in cheek, the Victorian Premier has now said, in defence of you, although you would want a better defence of yourself than this statement: `The world now knows that Peter Costello is the Treasurer of Australia.' Is that not a ringing endorsement of these statements that have sent the markets into a tailspin! We all know what the Victorian Premier likes to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4895"> label the Treasurer as: he is referred to as `dog'; not `the dog' or `a dog' or `bad dog' or `cruel dog' or `vicious dog', just `dog'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After his last foray the Treasurer is `the loaded dog'. Do you remember the dog in the Henry Lawson story in which a group of mates wanted to find some way in which they could fish without getting their hands caught? They decided that they would develop a cartridge, used in mining operations, to blow the fish out of the water. The trouble is that the dog got hold of the lit cartridge and was running around causing mayhem for everyone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The description of this dog in the Henry Lawson classic is very interesting&mdash;and we should ask the Victorian Premier whether he has this in mind in his reference to the Treasurer:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They had a big, black young retriever dog&mdash;or rather an overgrown pup, a big, foolish, four&hyphen;footed mate, who was always slobbering around them and lashing their legs with his heavy tail that swung around like a stockwhip. Most of his head was usually a red, idiotic slobbering grin of appreciation of his own silliness.</PARA>
<PARA>Never could there be a more apt description. I urge the Victorian Premier to read this short story and see whether the description fits his view of the Treasurer. The dog in the story runs around creating mayhem all over the place&mdash;just as you did when you broke the confidentiality of Dr Greenspan's comment&mdash;and, at the end of it all, the story concludes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For half an hour or so after the explosion&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>your gaffe&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">there were several bushmen round behind the stable who crouched, doubled up, against the wall, or rolled gently on the dust, trying to laugh without shrieking.</PARA>
<PARA>That is your colleagues. They are the people on your side of the parliament who know the extent of your gaffe, but many of them like the fact that you have done it&mdash;not because you have embarrassed the nation but because you have diminished your own standing. Just to conclude this point on the analogy with this book, when the men got back to camp the description of the dog continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And the dog that had done it all, Tommy, the great, idiotic mongrel retriever, came slobbering round Dave and lashing his legs with his tail, and trotted home after him, smiling his broadest, longest, and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reddest smile of amiability, and apparently satisfied for one afternoon with the fun he'd had.</PARA>
<PARA>Does the Treasurer believe that he has had fun at the expense of the international money markets? Does the Treasurer believe that he has represented the interests of this nation? I hardly think so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the issue of honesty, let me go to the denial that the Treasurer made when he was caught:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I never quote other countries' interest rates. That is fanciful if [the report] suggests to the contrary.</PARA>
<PARA>But when the tape was provided, there he was dissembling. We all saw him on TV saying, `No, no, no, no. I was reporting my assessment,' and saying that it was not what Dr Greenspan had told him. If you get the transcript of the recording he goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He indicated to me that he saw no threats to inflation down the track so he&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is Dr Greenspan&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">indicated to me that there was no reason to expect a change on the current scene as he sees it.</PARA>
<PARA>That is not you coming to your own view; that is you reporting him. Do you deny that? You were given the opportunity in this parliament today on three occasions to deny it. You were given a further opportunity in the censure and you have not done it. You have a responsibility as part of your obligations as the senior economic office holder in this country to tell the truth and you have not done it today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have been caught out. There is enough evidence to hang you on this. But we know that you will not give up and we know that you will persist. The real issue is what the Prime Minister is prepared to do. Let us go to his code of conduct and his expectations of ministerial standards. On the matter of ministerial conduct, this is what the Prime Minister made great play about in his very first speech as Prime Minister in this parliament:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ministers must be honest in their public dealings and should not intentionally mislead the Parliament or the public. Any misconception caused inadvertently should be corrected at the earliest opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA>You have misled the public and you have not corrected it. You have tried to avoid it, you <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4896"> have tried to obfuscate and, in the process, you have done great disservice to this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the Prime Minister stands for anything in lifting standards, he should have moved on Alexander Downer and he should be moving on your disgraceful performance. You have been out of the country for one week and look at the damage that has been caused. None of those doors will be open to you and a whole lot of your phone calls will not be answered. You have not had the decency yet to apologise to Dr Greenspan. How are the posts overseas dealing with this circumstance? The fact is that Australia's reputation is diminished and you are responsible for doing it. This rests fairly on your shoulders and it has come about because of your arrogance and your cockiness. You are sneering at those who criticise, you are not prepared to face up to the responsibilities of office and, in the process, Australia suffers. This is something you should be thoroughly ashamed of but, more importantly, it is something that the Prime Minister should act upon and upon which he should seek your resignation. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Talk about devaluing the censure&mdash;they have written it out of the proceedings of this place as a serious weapon of censure by the opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, what would you expect, given their performance at question time? We were in opposition for far too long&mdash;some 13 years. I can assure new members on the government side that we know something about opposition <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tactics&mdash;sadly, too much. But we never, at our worst moments, during our worst days, conducted a question time as they did. It was obvious that they ran out of questions. They could not even call for divisions. They lost the opportunity on two occasions to call for divisions&mdash;the most simple task that an opposition could possibly have. Then they did not even have a censure motion or a motion for the suspension of standing orders prepared. They were busily writing it out during the one and only division.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are a disorganised rabble, and that is reflected in their presentation of policy&mdash;as much as we know what it may be. We give them the opportunity to ask 10 questions a day during question time and they are still unable to prepare for it. They come in with only a handful of questions and wait until question No. 4 or No. 5&mdash;this very grave matter which must occupy the time of the national parliament&mdash;to ask the Treasurer (Mr Costello) about this incident. That is how seriously they take it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have just seen from the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) how seriously he takes the matter. He started quoting at length from Henry Lawson. Where is the seriousness of this issue that we must put aside all the other business of the day? You did not take it seriously during question time and, sure as anything, you are not taking it seriously now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some winners from the extraordinarily poor performance of the member for Holt today. Firstly, there is the member for Bruce (Mr Griffin). I do not know whether anybody noticed him sitting back there, but I did, because he is the next member for Holt. He wants to shift from the seat of Bruce, which is marginal and very likely&mdash;if I might be slightly overconfident, certain&mdash;to fall to the Liberal Party at the next election. As far as he is concerned, the member for Holt, former Senator Evans, cheated him out of the seat of Holt when his seat of Corinella was abolished in a redistribution in Victoria prior to the last election. He is grinning very broadly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other winner, of course, is the member for Hotham, the aspirant for the deputy leadership of the opposition and, soon after, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4897"> the leadership of the opposition. He is the next shadow Treasurer; of that there is no doubt. He has all the bluster, the bluff and the overconfidence reminiscent of Paul Keating; not the shadow Treasurer. He should receive the accolade of being a Keating impersonator. So there is no doubt there will be a fundamental realignment in the leadership of the other side before very much longer. It is obviously reflected in their performances in the chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One cannot help wondering, given their inept tactics, so blatantly incompetent, whether or not the Manager of Opposition Business, the member for Hotham, with his designs on the shadow treasurership and eventually on the leadership of the opposition, is running dead. Is this all part of his grand plan to embarrass the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition? If it is not, he is still achieving his same objective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the hard things to accept is criticism of any member on this side, particularly the Treasurer in an international forum, by the former Mr Bean of foreign affairs, the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, former Senator Evans. If anybody should be accused of letting down his country and committing diplomatic incidents, it is former Senator Evans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who will ever forget his extraordinary gaffe in 1992, as reported in a Hong Kong newspaper? He had a meeting with Chris Patten, the Hong Kong Governor. Afterwards, he had this to say to journalists:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Governor's totally preoccupied&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>with the loss of the Governor's pet dog, Soda&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the subject entered our conversation three times.</PARA>
<PARA>That is insulting enough&mdash;accusing Chris Patten of being concerned, in this bilateral meeting, only with discussing his lost dog. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Governor's dog is probably a supreme delicacy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">They'll turn it into hors d oeuvres for Deng Xiaoping who I'm told eats four puppies a day.</PARA>
<PARA>You want to know about shaming your country! That is a calculated insult of the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> leader of the People's Republic of China. Where was the apology then? Where was the criticism by his colleagues at that time? The list goes on and on. It is just extraordinary. It was all nicely summarised for us by a senior journalist, Don Woolford, on 14 June 1991, writing in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> . He listed all the gaffes, mistakes, insults and errors of judgment by the member for Holt. I will just pick a couple of them. There is a whole list; I am happy for anybody to check it as a matter of record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1991 he created a diplomatic incident in South Africa when he leapt out of his car and tackled a South African security guard in Cape Town. I cannot use the language here or anywhere else, frankly, except perhaps down on the waterfront. He accused him of being `something useless' because this security guard had committed some transgression&mdash;we never knew what it was.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps it was similar to a problem he had when he visited Berlin in 1989 when he decided to detour to a monument on his way to the airport. He got caught in a traffic jam which threatened to make him miss his plane. He leapt out of his Mercedes, strode down to the vehicle carrying his staff, which was caught two cars behind, and roundly abused the uncomprehending German driver for not keeping up. The list goes on. He might like to advise the House what he said to a Pakistani television crew in 1990 when they asked him for a comment after he arrived at Lahore airport&mdash;at the end, admittedly, of a long, hard day. There was similar sort of language, an obscenity and a blasphemous comment, to what he said to the South African guard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Former Senator Evans, as foreign minister, was no great representative of our nation. He did not represent the hopes and aspirations of our people. He had a foul, hair&hyphen;triggered temper and time and again he created diplomatic incidents. Even his mistakes, his appalling judgments, which led to enormous strain with a number of countries, pale into insignificance beside the former Prime Minister's comment in late 1993 about Dr Mahathir, the Prime Minister of Malaysia, whom he called recalcitrant. Where was the member for Holt, the member for Hotham and the Leader of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4898"> Opposition at that time? That was a diplomatic incident which led to the loss of trade, so important to our future and the future of Malaysia in the region, and to an estrangement between our two countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His performance on the international stage is something for us to be genuinely embarrassed about instead of this completely false charge against the Treasurer. Has anybody mentioned this to you out in the electorate in the last week or so as you have been wandering around? How out of touch does the Labor Party have to get before they finally wake up and realise what the concerns and expectations of the Australian people really are? They do not relate in any shape or form to the US bond rate. They relate to the issues we are tackling as a government on a day-to-day basis: economic growth, micro-economic reform, industrial relations reform and the like, all of which have been blocked in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that the shadow Treasurer has no credibility on these major issues, the issues that will determine the living standards and the way of life of all Australians. Two days before the budget on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press</EMPHASIS>, on 18 August 1996, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What we should be targeting is balance in three years time not a massive surplus in two.</PARA>
<PARA>Who is doing that? Who is reducing, eliminating, the budget deficit over three years as demanded by the shadow Treasurer? The government, of course. Who is frustrating us and blocking us in the Senate? To a large extent, the Labor Party. The day after the budget, the shadow Treasurer again repeated the gist of those remarks when he said on the Peter Couchman program on 3LO:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The budget deficits were getting too big again, they had to be brought back, but that was a medium term task that we believed could have been accomplished with infinitely less pain over a three year period.</PARA>
<PARA>He said this only 24 hours before the government had delivered its budget achieving exactly the target the shadow Treasurer was setting for his own side of politics and for the government of the day. What credibility does he have? No wonder there is a complete <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> dearth of information from him about Labor's alternate economic policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what you would expect from somebody with relevance deprivation syndrome. He has run up the white flag. Everybody knows it. His branches know it; they are being stacked. The member for Bruce knows it. The member for Hotham hopes it to be true and will encourage it in whatever way he can. He was a senior cabinet minister for 13 years and within weeks of going into opposition he caved in. So much for his commitment to the Labor cause. How does he explain his timidity, his failures to engage in public policy debate in this country to the grassroots, the rank and file of the Labor Party? They have been good to him&mdash;very good. He swanned all over the world on 120 to 150 overseas trips, whatever it was, on government business, of course. He owes the Labor Party, but he does not address their fundamental concerns, let alone their hopes and aspirations for the future. He comes into this place with trumped up charges against the Treasurer who was able to do in his first budget what no Treasurer since John Howard in the Fraser administration was able to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For all the bluff, bluster, exaggeration and overblown rhetoric of the member for Hotham, the fact is that this is a nonsense censure motion moved so early in the life of the opposition as to render all following censure motions irrelevant and meaningless. This opposition are desperate. They completely bungled question time. They think they have a minister on the ropes. We come in expecting the Labor Party to show their full strength, their full political wit and have some idea of their strategic ambitions. Instead, we got meandering questions from a former senator who is still unable to reduce his questions to 50 words. We are still getting these one minute or 1&half;&hyphen;minute questions which are self-answering or even rhetorical. In any event, they are totally ineffective. It makes you laugh.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been in this place since 1983. I have seen the giants of the Labor Party on the floor of this parliament and the Old Parliament House. What would Mick Young think of a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4899"> censure motion of this kind? What degree of importance would he afford it?</PARA>

Since we are so undertaxed by any relevant international standard, there is a case for having some overall revenue increases.</PARA>
<PARA>He does not talk about tax reform; he talks about tax increases. Did he stay around to defend his position, to justify his claim for high taxes? No. He retreated to bed with the flu. Seventy&hyphen;two hours later he had a miraculous recovery, did press conferences and was available to every journalist, every interviewer in this country. It is a new technique. Go to bed with the flu when you really stuff up. In that case, we will not see Gareth Evans again for the rest of this week because he will have to go to bed again.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Paragraph (5) of the motion proposed by the Leader of the House is out of order. It is out of order because its effect is to override the capacity of one voice in the Main Committee to refer the bill back to the House. That attacks the fundamental basis on which the Main Committee was established&mdash;namely, that it would deal with non-controversial matters. Embedded in standing orders 270 and 276 is the fact that one voice is sufficient to send the matter back from the Main Committee to the House. The effect of paragraph (5) of the motion proposed by the Leader of the House destroys the basis on which the parliament established the Main Committee and changes fundamentally the nature of the Main Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, pursuant to standing order 100, I have put my motion of dissent to your ruling in writing. I indicate in advance that the honourable member for Barton (Mr McClelland), of counsel, proposes to second it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Mr Deputy Speaker, the fact that you gave me a considered ruling made me somewhat reluctant to move dissent from your ruling. I also make the point to the House that when I carefully considered raising this point of order and considered very carefully moving dissent from the chair's ruling, I took the opportunity of advising the Speaker of my proposed course of action so as to ensure that the chair would have an opportunity to give serious consideration to the fundamental point that I raised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I move dissent because it is clear that paragraph (5) of the motion moved by the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) is out of order. Why is it out of order? It seeks to do, by way of suspension, that which the House can only do by changing its standing orders. The effect of paragraph (5) of the motion moved by the Leader of the House is to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> destroy the basis on which this House established the Main Committee. We will not find any precedence for this in Browning or Erskine May. Why? Because on this matter we are effectively the masters of our own destiny.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A couple of years ago, in 1994, members of this House established the Main Committee for particular and limited purposes, quite clearly, on the basis of recommendations made expressly by the Procedure Committee which were clearly adopted by this House when it received the report and when it adopted the standing orders. If we are looking to the basis on which the House ought to consider my motion to dissent from your ruling, we need to look at what the House had in mind when it adopted the Main Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first step in this process is the report of the Procedure Committee <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">About time: bills, questions and working hours</EMPHASIS>. At paragraphs 44 and 51, you find the intention of the Procedure Committee when it made its report to the House. Paragraph 44 stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To avoid unproductive consideration of controversial bills in the Main Committee and to minimise time being taken up at the report stage in the House, the guiding principle for the selection of bills should be that only bills on which there is potential for agreement to be reached should be referred to the Main Committee.</PARA>
<PARA>That is further reflected by paragraph 51 of the report which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The additional legislative time would open up fuller opportunities, in the House, for debate on the major and controversial items . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The clear intention of the Procedure Committee when it made its recommendations to the House&mdash;which were ultimately adopted and saw the establishment of the Main Committee&mdash;was that the Main Committee would deal with non-controversial matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the then member for Bonython and the now High Commissioner for London, Dr Blewett, presented the report to the parliament and referred, on 28 October, to the recommendations to establish the Main Committee, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this recommendation would in effect establish two parallel and coincident streams of legislation. One would be in the main committee&mdash;for non&hyphen; <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4903">controversial matters&mdash;and the other in the House, for more controversial bills.</PARA>
<PARA>Speaking in the same debate, the member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay), who was a member of the Procedure Committee, on the same day said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I reject the proposition . . . that it will become the place to which the government will shunt contentious legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>The member for Watson, further in his contribution, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposal that the government would shunt contentious legislation to that committee is groundless.</PARA>
<PARA>The House so embraced that comment from the member for Watson that they immediately gave him an extension of time. When the then Prime Minister came to the House in February 1994 and presented the then government's suggested changes to the standing orders to effect the Main Committee, after the appropriate procedures had been gone through, the Procedure Committee doing a report and the presentation of the Procedure Committee report to the parliament, the then Prime Minister in presenting the report said in respect of the Main Committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, the handling of legislation&mdash;particularly the need to free up chamber time for the proposed consideration of legislation by providing a main committee, or second chamber, for handling routine and uncontroversial bills.</PARA>
<PARA>The now Prime Minister, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), who was then the Manager of Opposition Business, in his contribution on that debate said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A lot of people on both sides of this parliament have a great respect for this institution. Some are less enthusiastic about it, but a lot care about it a great deal. I am certainly one of those people . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am genuinely worried about the decline in public esteem for the parliament. All of us share some of the blame for that. We take our share of the blame. The government must take its share of the blame.</PARA>
<PARA>In respect of the Main Committee he went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our attitude is basically to give it a go.</PARA>
<PARA>But to give what a go? To establish a subservient committee, the Main Committee, which would deal with non&hyphen;controversial matters. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> How did the standing orders embed that principle? The standing orders embedded that principle by the first proviso, standing order 270, and then by standing order 276. Standing order 270, the first proviso, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Provided that a bill or other order of the day may be returned to the House for consideration at any time during its consideration in the Main Committee by agreement to a motion which may be moved without notice by any Member (no seconder required) "That further proceedings be conducted in the House" which motion shall be determined without amendment or debate.</PARA>
<PARA>Standing order 276 goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Every question in the Committee shall be decided on the voices and if any Member dissents from the result announced by the Chair, the question shall be recorded in the minutes as unresolved.</PARA>
<PARA>So what did the House have in mind when it established the Main Committee? The House had in mind a chamber that would deal with non&hyphen;controversial matters, in which one voice&mdash;one member&mdash;could move the motion and, by the recording of that voice, have the matter sent back here. Why? It was because the parliament only ever intended that the Main Committee deal with matters that every member of this parliament regarded as non&hyphen;contentious, that every member of this parliament conceded, agreed and thought it was appropriate to send to the Main Committee to debate and discuss it, to free up time in the House for other, generally controversial matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the report of the review that was conducted by the Procedure Committee, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Time for review: bills, questions and working hours</EMPHASIS>, presented in June 1995, the committee gave an analysis of the way the Main Committee had been working. At page 14, paragraph 4.4.5, the Procedure Committee said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee concurs with the Leader of the House&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the now Leader of the Opposition&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">who commented that `Clearly, (the Main Committee's) creation has enabled additional opportunities for Members to debate non&hyphen;controversial legislation and to consider issues of concern to them and their constituents. The scheduling of business for consideration by the Main Committee has been constructive and, consequently, a wide range of subjects have been raised and debated. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4904"> </PARA>
<PARA>In its subsequent paragraph the committee said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee does not propose any change to the standing orders to increase the range of business referred to the Main Committee.</PARA>
<PARA>Why? It was because everyone believed that the Main Committee was acting and operating appropriately. The submission presented to the Procedure Committee by the then opposition manager of business, the now Leader of the House, did not even refer to the Main Committee, such was the general satisfaction with and acceptance of the basis upon which the Main Committee had been established.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How was that process of dealing with non&hyphen;controversial matters, items on which every member of this chamber agreed, embedded? It was embedded in the capacity of one voice, one member&mdash;one voice of conscience or one voice of dissent&mdash;to go to the Main Committee and refer the matter back here because a conscience view of a member of parliament dictated that it was not appropriate to be conducted in the Main Committee, as he or she took the view that it was a controversial matter. How does the motion by the Leader of the House by way of suspension seek to attack that? Paragraph (5) says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Main Committee continuing debate on the Bill regardless of any unresolved questions.</PARA>
<PARA>What is the sleight of hand? It is to override the clear and precise intent of the first proviso of standing order 270, combined with standing order 276. If you want to override, attack, destroy and undermine the entire basis upon which the Main Committee rests, if you want to destroy or seek to destroy the foundation upon which the Main Committee rests, you cannot come into this House in respect of one particular bill and try to do it by sleight of hand. If you want to do that you must come into this House and move a substantive motion by way of amendment to standing orders to change the basis upon which the Main Committee is constituted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the House believes that this paragraph is not out of order then what can the Leader of the House come to this chamber tomorrow and seek to do in precisely the same way? We might discover that the convenience of the Leader of the House sees a motion to suspend <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> standing orders to enable the Main Committee to continue meeting while a division of the House is in progress&mdash;substantially the same point. We could also have before the House, if the House does not agree with my motion to dissent from the chair's ruling, a motion by way of suspension which would have the effect that the Main Committee could continue to meet when the House had adjourned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a fundamental attack on the basis upon which this House, in 1994, established the Main Committee. What does paragraph (5) of the motion moved by the Leader of the House seek to do? It seeks to destroy the bulwark that holds the Main Committee together. What bulwark holds the Main Committee together? One voice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this House is not unanimous in its view that it is not appropriate for a matter to be dealt with in sideshow alley&mdash;the Main Committee&mdash;then one voice sends it back. If you want to attack the fundamental basis of the Main Committee established by this House, then you have to come into this House and move a change to the standing orders to have a substantive base. You cannot attack the fundamental basis of the Main Committee by a motion to suspend standing orders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy  Speaker, with the greatest of respect to the chair, paragraph (5) is out of order because it overrides the capacity of one voice to refer a matter back from the Main Committee to the House. To accept that attacks the fundamental basis upon which the Main Committee was established, namely, to deal only with non&hyphen;controversial matters. That is embedded in standing orders 270 and 276.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the House, by suspension, seeks to destroy the basis upon which the Main Committee is established. He wants to fundamentally change the nature of the Main Committee. You can do that only by substantive motion. Paragraph (5) of the motion moved by the Leader of the House is out of order. The House should consign paragraph (5) to where the Leader of the House proposes to consign the euthanasia debate, namely, the dust bowl. I urge the House to support my motion.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the motion dissenting from your ruling in your formal position as Deputy Speaker. The member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) raised a number of very valid points. The proposed motion by the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) proposes a fundamental variation to the structure and purpose of the Main Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect, Mr Deputy Speaker, it is our argument that it is for you to enforce the spirit and intention of the standing orders and not something to be left to a majority partisan vote that would occur. Hence, we say that you can rule the motion out of order.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact of the matter is that section 1 of the constitution says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislative power of the Commonwealth shall be vested in a Federal Parliament, which shall consist of the Queen, a Senate and House of Representatives. . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is this House which we are in at this very time. It makes no mention at all of a main committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Main Committee was initially set up as an experiment by the House of Representatives to facilitate efficiencies in the way it undertook its business. But it was set up in very limited circumstances where there were matters of a non&hyphen;controversial nature and that was the fundamental premise upon which it was based.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Perth referred to a number of extracts not only of speeches of Dr Blewett and the member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) but other sources. I refer, for instance, to a speech delivered on 6 February 1994 by the then Prime Minister when foreshadowing the Procedure Committee report. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The procedure committee report dealt with three main areas:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. first, the handling of legislation&mdash;particularly the need to free up chamber time for proposed consideration of legislation by providing a main committee or second chamber, for handling routine and uncontroversial bills.</PARA>
<PARA>In no way could the euthanasia bill be regarded as routine and uncontroversial. We have all been inundated with correspondence indicating the intensity of debate in the community <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> on that proposed legislation. It is perhaps one of the most controversial and intensely felt proposals that I have seen in this parliament not only in my very limited lifespan here but also from my immediate recollection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), the member for Swan at that stage, in presenting amendments to the standing orders, again stressed the fundamental premise when on 10 February 1994 he said in respect of the amendments regarding the Main Committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">make it as simple as possible, with a quorum effectively requiring in place only a chairperson, one government member and one non&hyphen;government member.</PARA>
<PARA>He noted that the use of that description was deliberate. I will say something about the quorum requirements presently. He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the main committee is to work as envisaged by the Blewett committee and by the government, it ought to have before it legislation which is effectively non&hyphen;controversial but which does require a bit of detailed attention from the House, in the spirit of bipartisan cooperation.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, I trust there will be cooperation in the debate on the euthanasia legislation but that debate will be very intense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To continue to underline the significance of the point that I am making, in addition to those examples referred to by the member for Perth, I refer to comments by the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) when, on 10 February, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are worried about the proposal for a main committee. This could mean a further reduction of the importance of the role of the House of Representatives in the government of this country.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, despite assertions that the government is here to restore or foster representative democracy, its actions do not match its words. This is a classic example of where the government will be demeaning the significance of the House of Representatives, which we are all in now, that is connected to the Australian public by way of media networks and of course by virtue of the Australian public being able to come in here and sit in the galleries. The main chamber simply will not access the Australian public or, stated in reverse and more correctly, the Australian <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4906"> public will be shut out of this debate if it is referred to the Main Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I underline the point even further by referring to a comment made by the now Prime Minister (Mr Howard) when he was in opposition. He made the comment with respect to the Blewett committee proposals on a radio broadcast on 3 June 1994. With respect to the Main Committee, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My approach is very much trial and error, wait and see. We agreed in principle with a second Chamber; we are prepared to cooperate with the Government to try and make it work. If it does work, then that's good. If it does allow for more intense debate in the main Chamber, if it means that the major issues are debated in the main Chamber, if it results in a higher quality of debate in the main Chamber, that's better.</PARA>
<PARA>The motion proposing to send the euthanasia bill to the Main Committee does precisely the opposite. It does not allow for the more intense debate in the main chamber. It literally is shunting the debate off. I, for one, have not as yet formulated my views as to how I will vote on the euthanasia legislation. I certainly want to pay very careful attention to that debate and it simply will not be possible if I have other matters to attend to here in the House of Representatives. These are matters which were considered quite clearly when the Main Committee was established through the standing orders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to paragraph (5) of the motion, which was referred to by the member for Perth, clearly the thrust of what the government has in mind is also underlined by paragraph (4), which purports to amend the quorum requirements which are set out in standing order 272.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Truss)" NAMEID="10000">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="10000">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Truss)</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I remind the honourable member for Barton that he must confine his remarks to the ways in which he considers the Deputy Speaker's ruling is inappropriate, not the substance of the motion which may be considered later.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JK6">Mr McCLELLAND</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly. The Deputy Speaker's ruling is inappropriate because the motion purports not to suspend the standing orders but effectively to amend the standing orders, and that is something it cannot do. As the member for Perth said, that has to be done formally through the appropri <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> ate mechanisms and debate. For instance, standing order 272 provides that the quorum of the Main Committee is three&mdash;being the chair, one government member and one opposition member. Paragraph (4) of the motion seeks to, in a backdoor fashion, amend that by saying that the quorum is three, certainly, but of the chair and two members; there does not have to be an opposition member.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly the purpose of the original requirement would have enabled the opposition to, aside from relying upon standing orders 270 and 276, ensure the debate returned to the House; it could simply have abolished the quorum by leaving the Main Committee. That will no longer be possible as a result of paragraph (4) of the motion. As mentioned, this is in addition to what is being proposed in paragraph (5).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The unworkability of paragraph (5) is clear on its face. The member for Perth indicated that there is a possibility that the Main Committee may continue to sit even when the House does not sit. On one argument, paragraph (5) would require that to occur, because it says that the Main Committee continues debate on the bill regardless of any unresolved questions. Arguably, that is a direction to the Main Committee to continue sitting whatever. In that context, it is again clearly contrary to the purpose of the standing orders and, for that reason, out of order.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer, Mr Deputy Speaker, to standing order 274, which enables the chairman of the committee to suspend the committee to enable a member to attend a division. Paragraph (5) arguably would preclude that occurring, because it is a direction to continue rolling on in the Main Committee come what may. In standing order 282, if any sudden disorder arises in the Main Committee, the chair may on motion without notice by any member forthwith suspend the sitting and shall report the disorder to the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Arguably, again, paragraph (5) of the motion deprives the chair of that opportunity or means of enforcing discipline because paragraph (5) can quite clearly be construed as being a direction to the Main Committee to continue the debate come what may. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4907"> Indeed, one infers that is the intention of the motion, because the government does not want debate in the Main Committee interrupted as a result of any action by the opposition. So, for these reasons, the motion proposed by the manager of government business is out of order.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, much of the government of this country, as is the government of Great Britain and indeed other Westminster nations, is determined by convention. Once people, no matter what their office is, start to depart from those conventions, we start to get into very dangerous water.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As was indicated in comments by the then opposition members, now government members, they were very concerned that the establishment of the Main Committee might diminish both the standing of the House of Representatives and the substance of debate proceeding in the House of Representatives. That clearly is the convention which was developed in the establishment of the Main Committee, that convention being that the Main Committee is only to deal with uncontroversial matters which were referred to it with the consent of both parties. Indeed, as the member for Perth rightly pointed out, standing orders 270 and 276 ensure that to be the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This motion, while it may appear expedient in terms of getting through some degree of workload&mdash;and I do not exaggerate the point&mdash;is very dangerous because it is a direct challenge to the fundamental rationale and convention behind the establishment of the Main Committee. For that reason, Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the dissent from your ruling.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to dinner I was responding to the motion of dissent moved by the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4909"> member for Perth on your ruling as to whether or not you can put the motion which stands in my name on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> . In doing so, I have attempted to reasonably canvass the issues without straying too much from the exact and defined matter in the substance of the dissent. I have also been aware that some of the previous speakers have canvassed the issues a bit more generally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point I was making was that this is a private member's bill. In the normal course of events, the opportunities for members to debate a private member's bill are very limited indeed. Under those circumstances, and given that this is a matter of national debate and interest to many people, the government felt that it was appropriate that there be time provided for any member to speak on the issue. To facilitate giving members this opportunity to speak, the government's proposal is that the matters be first discussed and debated in the chamber for an hour and a half with three speakers a side. From the government side there would be essentially the mover of the motion, a second member who would presumably speak against the motion and the third member being the member for Northern Territory (Mr Dondas), having a specific interest on behalf of his constituency. Likewise we would expect the opposition to be able to put together three speakers who would canvass the issue. The issue would then be referred to the Main Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We understand that something like 45 members have indicated their intention to speak. I dare say that, as the debate is undertaken, there may well be more who wish to speak. The government in this budget session has a series of legislative proposals for which it has a mandate from the Australian people. We have tried to essentially compromise the government's legislative program with the right of members to speak on this issue. There has been a lot of airing of views about the Main Committee, and I refer specifically to the fifth part of my procedural motion. Those views have suggested that, being the second chamber, only secondary bills are dealt with there and that debate in the Main Committee does not enjoy the same visibility as debate in this chamber.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Main Committee has come a long way since its inception under the previous government in 1994. There has been bipartisan cooperation in maximising the benefits of the second chamber in a sensible, constructive manner. Very important bills are dealt with in the Main Committee, including the annual appropriation bills which were first referred to the Main Committee in 1995 under the former Labor government. Indeed, the appropriation bills for 1996-97 are at the present time being considered in the Main Committee, allowing the many members who wish to speak the full opportunity to do so. Honourable members would appreciate that, from the government's point of view, the first coalition budget in 13 years is a rather significant issue.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And so you should have provided that opportunity, as we provided you the same opportunity in 1994. Proceedings in the Main Committee are recorded in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> . There is no question about their being visible. There is provision in the Main Committee room for attendance by the public, and we have television monitoring which ensures that members can keep a track of proceedings there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This procedural motion will allow the government to program the debate subject to the demands of its legislative program. Let us not lose sight of the reality that it is a private member's bill, which, under normal circumstances, could not expect to receive an airing such as is proposed by this motion. Moreover, the private member's business selection committee did not allocate any time for the second reading debate on the euthanasia bill, and accordingly without the passage of this motion the bill would not be debated at all. Accordingly, this motion facilitates rather than restricts debate on the bill.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate that, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I think what I am saying is entirely relevant because the intent of the mover of the motion of dissent is that these matters should all be in the chamber. Our response is not only to deal with the technical issues that he has raised but also to respond to the policy issues that he has raised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make the point that this is providing people with an opportunity to be heard that they would not otherwise have had. It is private member's business, not government business. We are not restricting debate. We are allowing debate. We are providing for debate. The Prime Minister made it very clear in his public statements that, on an issue of national importance, raising the very grave issues that this legislation does, members are entitled, and the public at large would expect the parliament, to address the issues regardless of the differing points of view that people may have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We did encourage the proponent of the bill to seek agreement and there was some agreement. That agreement is not now forthcoming and, under those circumstances, the government has taken the view that to discharge its obligations and the commitments it gave it was necessary to set up a procedural motion to protect the right of members to so speak. That is simply all that we are doing. We are providing 10 minutes per speaker. Again, that was discussed at the time with the opposition members. It is consistent with the time provided generally for second reading debate of private members' bills during private members business time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The motion also varies the quorum arrangements for debate on the bill to require the presence of the chair and two members and, in so doing, it drops the normal requirement for one government member and one non&hyphen;government member to be part of a quorum. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> This is a temporary measure simply reflecting the fact that the major parties have agreed to their members having a conscience vote and that it is not a government bill.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, that is not the issue at the core of my ruling. The question is whether or not it is competent for this House to seek to suspend the standing orders which this House itself put in place for the operation of that committee. It would seem to me that standing orders 399 to 401 make it abundantly clear that the House does have the capacity to amend or suspend its standing orders for the operation of that House if it chooses to do so. Whether or not that is wise is a matter for debate by the House, but my ruling is that it is competent for the House to decide whether or not it wishes to suspend standing orders.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been no more dishonourable assault than this on the integrity and processes of this House in the nine years in which I have been a member, and I suspect in the memories of all members of this House. Let me say to members that not only do we believe that this would have been an offence against the standing orders&mdash;a matter which has been resolved by the vote&mdash;but also, in my mind, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4913"> there is a very significant constitutional question of whether the processes that are proposed for adoption will take this matter beyond the legitimate capacity of this parliament to legislate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 40 of the constitution of Australia provides that questions arising in this House shall be determined by a majority of votes. The process that has been proposed by the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) is that the Main Committee debate shall continue regardless of any unresolved questions. That means that in that place, which purports to be this parliament in action, there will be no votes. A parliament which has no votes is not a democracy. It is not a parliament under this constitution. So we have a full frontal attack on one of the fundamental tenets that this House is obliged to uphold by the prime law of this country&mdash;the constitution of Australia. The dignity and respect of members is so undermined that I believe that each and every member of this House ought regard this with abhorrence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard some people suggest that this is a convenient way of dealing with a controversial measure. What absolute nonsense! This is one of the most significant and controversial measures ever put before the parliament. What about the attempt to make a distinction in this debate between matters that are brought forward by private members and by government?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have the government saying that they will give priority in this parliament to their legislative program and, because this is merely a private member's matter, it will be shoved into a back room with no attention, with a quorum that has been reduced to three to hear debate on one of the most contentious bills that has ever been before this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not unique that private members bring in controversial bills. McKenzie&hyphen;Lamb brought in the Family Law Bill. That private member's bill again divided members not on any basis of party line. That debate was had in the House and in the Senate. It was not shoved off to some room where the people of Australia are excluded. Most importantly, it was not put off to an environment where the concerns and wishes of members participating <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in a debate count for nought. If it is lawful for this parliament to suspend the right to vote in a parliamentary debate, it is lawful in this parliament by a simple majority, through a government member, to exclude any debate on any issue of substance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What more contemptible process could emerge? The second chamber was established in such a way as to make sure the power of this House was not removed. There can be discussion in that chamber, but whenever a controversial matter arises it must be brought back to this House so the House can vote on it. That is to be overturned. This parliament has had plenty of opportunities in the past to debate controversial matters brought forward by private members. What is this case of necessity that is to be made out?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is there any urgency facing the government's business? Let us look realistically at the government's legislative program in the Senate. The Senate has before it some 61 packages of legislation which the government seeks to give priority to. There are 25 budget and 36 non-budget related measures. Even with the cooperation which has been extended by the opposition in an unprecedented way&mdash;that is, allowing two extra weeks of debate in the Senate&mdash;and forgoing all the rules that the previous opposition insisted upon in relation to allowing debate in the same session of parliament, there is no realistic prospect of these measures coming before the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Would that chamber treat its members with the same contempt that the Leader of the House is proposing to treat members of this House with&mdash;that is, to suggest that members of that chamber would not be heard by their colleagues in this debate? This is one of those rare debates in Australian political history where I believe at least a substantial number of members of this parliament would be interested in following the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4914"> Most of the debates in this place are set piece debates. We know the outcomes. The government proposes legislation and its members are bound by a caucus. The Labor Party also binds its members by a caucus. The outcomes of those debates are predetermined. With the difference in numbers between the parties, the Independents will have no signifi cance in terms of the outcome. There may be an element of theatre in the debate, but for practical purposes we know the outcome before the debate starts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not the case with this legislation. I have no idea how this debate will emerge and who will vote for what position. I believe there are a number of members&mdash;and I have spoken to a number of them myself&mdash;who are waiting to see how this debate emerges before they determine their views. How can they do that in this situation? This afternoon I went to the Main Committee during the censure debate in this chamber. In cooperation with the government we permitted debate on the appropriation bills to move to that place. We did that for the convenience of the government. Not one member objected to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The quorum for that chamber is three. When I was in that chamber there was not a quorum. There was no government member there. They adjourned for 10 minutes and then I had the respectable audience of three. The whole focus of that chamber is, as every member knows, to euthanase debates, to bury debates, to put them into the darkest recesses. Why can you do that? You can do that because it is convenient for the House. Not one member dissents from that idea.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second chamber was introduced in a climate of some concern for the then opposition. The then opposition said that we must be wary lest this be abused. What an irony that the abuse has been brought on by the Leader of the House. What an irony it is that the opposition has allowed its members a conscience vote not only on the substance of the matter but also on all matters associated with it&mdash;procedural and otherwise. It is ironic that the government still insists on holding a caucus over its members when it seeks to rort this institution and undermine the fabric and foundation of this institution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How can it be that I can listen to important contributions? I wait with great interest not so much to hear what the zealots who will take the first four or five speeches on either side have to say but to hear the people who are actually grappling with these issues and to find out how they will debate and think through these complex issues. I wait with <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> great interest, for example, to hear the contribution of my colleague the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) who I believe will have some interesting reflections. I wait with some interest to hear what the member for New England (Mr Sinclair) will say in this debate with his experience of the parliamentary process. I wait with great interest to hear how some of the newly elected members reflect on these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For my own part, I say frankly to you that, although I come into this debate with a pretty clear idea of how I am going to vote, I am not so arrogant as to say that I might not be influenced by the course of a debate where people are free to speak their minds. But how will I hear that; how will I know that; how will there be any colour to this debate; and how will it matter to the Australian people?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a matter which both sides regard and recognise as being of fundamental importance. It is truly a matter of life and death. What are we seeing? We are seeing debates on the flags bill and other trivial matters, which are of no significance in the national interest, being proceeded with in a farcical way in the House while this contentious and controversial bill is removed from the spotlight of public attention. This will take away the capacity for members to play a responsible part in parliamentary debate, to listen to what their colleagues say and to take part in one of the few debates that will actually be conducted seriously and in which every member will be examining their conscience, making decisions on and speaking according to their hearts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The one issue on which the Australian people wish to see their members responsibly living up to the charter that they have imposed on them by giving them their trust as members of this parliament is going to be shunted off and subsumed in an environment where there is no adequate reporting of those debates and where the normal coverage of this House simply is not available. This offends against every convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not true to say that those of us on the opposition side, who share my opinion that this is a contemptible way to deal with the parliament, have stood idly by&mdash;there is no <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4915"> whip on this&mdash;and made no practical suggestions. We have offered our willingness to participate in an extension of the sitting times of this parliament even though, if this legislation were to pass this House, it would come into a situation where the government has made no arrangements for time in the Senate anyway. The sponsors of this legislation must now know&mdash;my having referred to this now&mdash;that there is at least more than an arguable case that, even if this legislation passes, it is subject to constitutional challenge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not a light matter. It is referred to in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS>, and section 40 of the constitution is plain on its face. There have been issues previously in which this has been debated but they have never been material in a way which could be litigated. Here now is a matter which will be capable of litigation. Here now is the case where, even if the Andrews bill does get through, it will be capable of challenge by the Northern Territory government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those people on that side who are lining up to say that they are interested in a conscientious vote on conscientious grounds but who are supporting this repellent abuse&mdash;this precedent&mdash;that diminishes the rights of individual members of parliament are going to find themselves actually diminishing their capacity and putting at risk the very legislation they are sponsoring. I am appalled by this and believe that it is one of the most fundamental abuses that has occurred. As an individual member of this parliament, I have always taken a great sense of responsibility for my contributions&mdash;good or bad. However, because I am not one of the principal protagonists in this debate, I will participate in it in the secrecy and the confines of the Main Committee room, in an environment where those matters are not subject to vote and where democracy has been excluded. I regard it as contemptible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My colleague, the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith), who holds a different view on the substance and merits of the Andrews bill, is equally outraged. He will be moving an amendment which reflects our willingness to give time to debate in this House, recognising the importance and moral weight that the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Leader of the House has said is attached to this legislation. When we address matters of moral weight, it is not a matter of whether it is government business or private members business, it is the substance and weight of that legislation that counts; that is, whether it is controversial and whether the precedent is an abuse of the principles that this House should uphold.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was co&hyphen;author with the member for Moore (Mr Filing) of a dissenting report in which we indicated some fears about the Main Committee. However, I have said more than once since then that I was wrong. I believe the Main Committee has proven itself very well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My reaction to much of the substance of the speech by the member for Denison was that he must never have been in the Main Committee. I am reminded that he went up this afternoon. The member for Denison was horrified to find that you have to have a quorum of three in the Main Committee. In fact, the Main Committee is one step ahead of this chamber in that sense, because if there is not a quorum of three in the Main Committee and if that quorum does not include at least one government member and one opposition member then it is automatically suspended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been occasions when I blush to admit there may not have been three people in this chamber&mdash;certainly, if there were three, then not one government and one <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4916"> opposition member&mdash;and there is no such automatic suspension. The quorum requirement ensures that the Main Committee is not some backroom and that it cannot be run by the government without the opposition's knowledge and active presence to make it work.</PARA>

It was only raised by that other disruptive fellow who, it appears, cannot sit quiet for five minutes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I admit that there are some important issues at stake, but I want to assure anybody who might have believed the nonsense that the member for Denison spoke about that it is just not fact. He made the statement that `a parliament which has no votes is not a democracy'. We will vote on the bill. We will vote on it in here, which is where he wants the vote to happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a couple of reasons&mdash;some of them were in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">About Time </EMPHASIS>report of the Procedure Committee&mdash;why votes are not taken in the Main Committee. If the two <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4917"> chambers were functioning&mdash;giving the additional time for debate that backbenchers want&mdash;and both could have divisions, we would run the risk of divisions happening in both chambers at the same time. That is the first reason. If we are going to have two debating chambers, then it is an insurance that the vote can happen in only one of the chambers, and it is in this chamber&mdash;the chamber that the member for Denison was so hot and strong about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason that this motion is framed so that other divisions cannot be raised up in the Main Committee is to give people full opportunity to debate the bill. It is to facilitate the bill. It is so that people cannot wantonly and mischievously keep on aborting the debate up in the Main Committee. There were good reasons for putting into the initial standing orders what went in in relation to the Main Committee. We have had a bit of experience of the Main Committee since then, and not as much goodwill has reigned at all times as we might have hoped. On the whole, it has been fairly successful.</PARA>

We have social security legislation, the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4918"> Assistance) Bill, the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill, the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill, the CFM Sale Bill, the Statute Law Revision Bill, the Native Title Amendment Bill, the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill, the Family Law Amendment Bill, the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (1996&hyphen;97 Budget Measures) Bill, the Proceeds of Crime Amendment Bill, the Income Tax Assessment Bill, the Income Tax (Consequential Amendments) Bill, the Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Bill, the Flags Amendment Bill, the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) and the Sydney 2000 Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Amendment Bill. They are the bills that are on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Denison picks out one, the Flags Bill, and refers to it with derision. We will remind the member for Denison what he said tonight about the Flags Amendment Bill when we are debating that bill. We will remind him of his derisory attitude tonight towards that bill. The simple fact is that the budget and the government's legislation must go through this chamber in good time, this session. A large amount of it must be dealt with also by the Senate in good time. That is the government program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are talking about the precedence that is being given to a private member's bill and whether its debate should be in this chamber. The government has the House of Representatives sitting for an extra week, over and above the program we already had, to enable us to get through the budget session legislation. The government is the government; it is going to get its legislative program through&mdash;and it must, logically, give precedence to its own program over a private member's bill. But it is not shuffling the private member's bill out of sight. It is not saying, `We won't give it time.' There would be no sittings of the Main Committee to debate this bill if the government did not want the Main Committee to sit to debate it. The government is making provision to enable us to have all of those debates, including what would normally have the lowest precedence, that is, a private member's bill.</PARA>

If you did a comparison of the amount of legislation before parliament and the number of members of parliament then, you would get an indication of how those bills got debating time. Not only that, you should also do a comparison&mdash;if you are going to start comparing our parliament with parliaments of 20 years ago&mdash;of the use of the guillotine. The big argument in favour of the Main Committee was that we hoped it would do away with the need to use the guillotine, so that members could get to debate all the bills they wanted to and have the due amount of time.</PARA></TALK.START>

These things are done by agreement. But the fact is that if you go back and look at how many bills were guillotined under the previous government, particularly in previous parliaments&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fairness of the coalition government's family tax initiative was brought home in today's release of a report from Gillian Beer of the University of Canberra's National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling. I referred to the centre's director, Ann Harding, in my earlier contribution, reflecting on the conclusions of some of her earlier work that families were far more vulnerable under the previous Labor government and that a far greater proportion of families were ending up in poverty statistics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The centre's Ms Beer found that lower income families will gain the highest percentage increases in income and most of the benefits from the family tax initiative, with 40 per cent of the benefits going to families in the bottom 30 per cent of the family income distribution. In other words, the coalition's `cash for kids' measure favours the families in `Dunkley by the bay' who need it most. Ms Beer points out that well over half of the $1 billion worth of spending on the family tax initiative will be received by families with taxable incomes of less than $38,700 a year. A majority of families in `Dunkley by the bay' earn below this figure. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly the member for Isaacs (Mr Wilton) is a little upset about how apparently good this family tax measure is for average families in Australia and he does not like to hear about it. So I will just commend to him the report from the University of Canberra. Perhaps it is very good reading for the member for Isaacs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I guess the interesting contrast is how we are making solid ground on improving the tax situation for Dunkley's families while those opposite are slipping and sliding around. It is clear from what the Treasurer (Mr Costello) said today that half of Labor's frontbench either have a favourite new tax or a tax they would like to increase. The interesting contrast is that the coalition is helping families in Dunkley while Labor still thinks it knows best how to spend the income that is available to Dunkley's families. Ms Beer's report concludes: </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is estimated that almost 71 per cent of all eligible families will benefit from the implementation of the family tax initiative.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YK6">Mr WILTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government today have been trumpeting the fact that the two family tax initiative bills before the House underpin their initiatives to assist the lot of the Australian family. Of course, the coalition made great play during the election campaign of the wondrous things they would do for the family, including the families of Dunkley, and of course those in the neighbouring electorate of Isaacs. As the Treasurer (Mr Costello) explained in his second reading speech, these bills will&mdash;according to him&mdash;give effect to the centrepiece of the government's election commitment to Australian families, that being the so&hyphen;called family tax initiative.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure the Treasurer deliberately used the word `centrepiece' because there are a few other initiatives affecting families which spring from the government's budget for 1996&hyphen;97 which the Treasurer and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) would rather that we and the Australian populous at large did not focus on, which goes to prove, as I am sure any magician will tell you, that this is nothing more than a great conjuring trick, a great magic trick, shamelessly perpetrated upon the Australian electorate.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4923">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we address the bills this evening, in which the government appears to be giving something to Australian families with one hand, the debate on this year's appropriation bills in the Main Committee clearly demonstrates that it is taking away from Australian families with the other hand, with some glee. I quote from the Treasurer's second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government recognises that providing an economic and social environment in which families can achieve their full potential is crucial to maintaining a strong, cohesive and compassionate society.</PARA>
<PARA>Further, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Providing financial assistance to those families with the greatest need is an investment in that economic and social environment.</PARA>
<PARA>I am sure those are fine sentiments&mdash;there is a lot of glib rhetoric such as we heard today from the Treasurer in question time&mdash;and I can assure the House that whenever the government genuinely seeks to improve the lot of the Australian family it will always receive the wholehearted support of the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These bills propose measures to recognise the cost of raising dependent children through the income tax system. But many of my colleagues who have spoken today have pointed out in some detail that only a very small proportion of Australian families will benefit at all from the measures which the government proposes. There are many deserving families and hard working Australian families who live in areas such as Frankston North in Dunkley who will miss out on any so&hyphen;called family tax initiatives altogether.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) so lucidly pointed out earlier in his contribution to this debate, when closer scrutiny is paid to the figures in this year's budget, it becomes clear that the $147 million allocated for the family tax initiative is far more than offset by the massive increase in general taxation revenue for that financial year. Of course, individuals will pay some $5.5 billion more in tax in this financial year, of which $1.8 billion can be attributed to bracket creep&mdash;meaning that for every dollar received by the government through the family tax <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> initiative almost $13 is removed through that insidious process called bracket creep. This is yet another of the government's nifty conjuring tricks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This side of the House has always been happy to support any measures under which families are better off, but the measures that are outlined in this document cannot be considered in isolation. The Treasurer also said in his second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The family tax initiative is a clear example of the government's commitment to giving families greater choice&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise those words `greater choice'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in how they spend their hard&hyphen;earned cash&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and I also emphasise those words `hard&hyphen;earned cash'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and in how they juggle work and family responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Each family is the best judge of what it needs, and the government's program of reforms reflects that approach.</PARA>
<PARA>When you consider that amongst the government's program of reforms which the Treasurer referred to are increases in HECS fees, an increase in charges for pharmaceuticals, the downgrading of the public health system, reduction of funding for legal aid, the scrapping of most labour market programs, cuts to child care and, in particular, the abolition of a large part of the dental health program, which had such a significant impact upon working men and women in Dunkley, only then can you begin to understand exactly what the Treasurer meant when he referred to giving families greater choice. That is what he said: he referred to giving families `greater choice in how they spend their hard&hyphen;earned cash'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Treasurer referred to choices for Australian families, but the choice is to pay more for a whole range of basic services or to go without. That is the choice they are faced with. I am sure that is not the choice he was referring to in that budget speech but that is the choice that many people are faced with. The truth of the matter is that families, even those who may gain some financial benefit from the tax measures in these bills, will <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4924"> receive no choice at all. As I have alluded to, many will miss out on basic necessities of life&mdash;and I cite dental health care and the opportunities for further education for their children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The words of the Treasurer in his second reading speech provide evidence that the coalition government's so&hyphen;called family policy stems not from the homes, the workplaces, the communities or the lives of ordinary Australians but rather these sentiments find their genesis in the driest of the dry economic rationalist textbooks and theories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my electorate of Isaacs we have the suburb of Cranbourne. As I said in this place before, it is part of the city of Casey, the fastest growing municipality in Australia, and could be described as being fairly typical of middle, rapidly growing Australia. The government would have us and the good people of Cranbourne believe that the tax and other initiatives that the Treasurer referred to during his second reading speech are aimed fairly and squarely at those Cranbourne residents and that they will be so much better off because of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at some fairly objective and fairly informed local commentary to see what prospects these reforms hold for the people of Cranbourne. I can do no better than quote the district commander of the Salvation Army, Envoy Derek Linsell, who on 5 October last year hosted the then Leader of the Opposition on a tour of Salvation Army facilities in Cranbourne. He summed up rather succinctly the fear and despair that this government's measures which impact on families have placed upon ordinary Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) is leaving the House. He interjects constantly until such time as I am about to cite some local evidence of the impact that your government's so&hyphen;called initiatives are having on families in Cranbourne, one of the hardest working, new&hyphen;home buying areas in Australia today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 3 September edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cranbourne Sun</EMPHASIS>, Envoy Linsell, the head of the Salvation Army in Cranbourne, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Cranbourne is all about achieving the great Australian dream of having a family and owning a house. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Many people come here expecting to get on the housing ladder and find they can't.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Cranbourne is facing a welfare crisis which could push many recipients into a permanent underclass.</PARA>
<PARA>We can see some very worrying signs. The member for Paterson might not be able to see those worrying signs but on our side of the House we can see them. We realise that we will always have poor people. We acknowledge that. There will always be people who are worse off than others, but the beauty of Australia in the last 10 or 15 years has been that we, Labor, put a safety net in place.

It will not take long for Australian families, as has been demonstrated in a recent by&hyphen;election in Queensland, to see through the government's charade, once they become aware of the government's lack of understanding and compassion for their needs and their struggles.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to speak tonight on these two important areas of the budget where the government has delivered unequivocally on its election promises. It has delivered unequivocally to that section of the community that for too long has been treated as second rate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For too long the families of Australia have been an afterthought. They were put in that position by the previous Labor government over 13 years. For too long they have been drowning, choking and struggling in a sea of loud&hyphen;mouthed minority groups and ill&hyphen;conceived and ill&hyphen;targeted Labor budget strategies. For too long this group to which I refer came way down the list of priorities of the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am speaking tonight, of course, of the family. This government has recognised the pre&hyphen;eminent place of the family unit in Australian society. While the member for Dunkley (Mr Billson) might have been giving the member for Isaacs (Mr Wilton) a bit of a rough time, I was quite surprised that the member for Isaacs was 14 minutes into his address before he mentioned the two bills&mdash;the Income Tax Rates Amendment (Family Tax Initiative) Bill and the Family (Tax Initiative) Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that he wanted to skirt the key issue, and that is that some real and genuine aid has been delivered to the middle and low income families of Australia. This government has recognised that the family is the core social unit of our society and has made it a priority to relieve the financial pressure on low and middle income families bringing up children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has recognised that just because hardworking average Australian couples with their 2.3 children, their mortgage, their school books, their school uniforms, their car repayments, their registration and the food on their table do not jump up and down and make a lot of noise does not mean that they do not deserve to be this government's No. 1 priority. This government has made them their No. 1 priority. We articulated that in our headland speeches. We articulated that in our election promises. In this measure we have delivered.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4927">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have delivered to them a family package that will put extra money in their pockets in real terms. More than that, this government has delivered a tax package which will reach families who need that money most. Before I outline the measures and initiatives which the government will deliver to families, let me take you, Mr Deputy Speaker, on a short trip down memory lane to the time when the Labor Party&mdash;the party supposedly with a reputation for representing the battlers of this country&mdash;turned their backs on those average parents of whom I speak, those same families of Australia. As painful as it might be for those opposite to listen to this, just bear with me for a moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What happened under Labor? Under Labor, household debt rose over $200 million or an equivalent of nearly 70 per cent of household disposable income. Under Labor, home loan repayments rose to 27 per cent of medium monthly family income, up from just 19 per cent under the Fraser government in 1983. Under Labor, sales tax revenue rose from $9.2 billion in 1992-93, the year before the Keating government took office or the last term of the Keating government, to $12.95 billion in 1995-96. That is a staggering increase of 40 per cent over the full three years of the last term of the Keating government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Isaacs talked about bracket creep depriving the battlers of Australia, although he did not specify how it would affect the battlers of Australia, of $1.8 billion. I would have thought the $1.8 billion would have applied broadly across the whole spectrum of government initiatives. But, if we take up that $1.8 billion, what about this measure here&mdash;and that was just one aspect of Labor taxation&mdash;that over a short time took $3.7 billion from the Australian battlers?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can see that in a whole range of matters. It crept in over a period of time. The more important items went from 10 per cent to 11 per cent to 12 per cent. The next range went from 20 per cent to 21 per cent to 22 per cent and so on. We also had two episodes of fuel excise increases, to say nothing of the five per cent sales tax on motor vehicles. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Under Labor, the Medicare levy ended up at 1.5 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Isaacs chastised us over pharmacy charges&mdash;that the co-payment has gone up to $20 for most Australians and up to $3.20 for those on benefits. As much as I would have liked those co-payments to have stayed at a lower level, I remind those opposite that those co-payments were introduced by the Labor Party. They progressively increased them, in the case of underprivileged Australians, to $2.70&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Under Labor, the PAYE taxes for small business were increased to bimonthly payments. In 1993, the Keating government delivered tax cuts with the greatest proportion of savings to people earning $50,000 per year&mdash;a figure which at the time was 67 per cent higher than average weekly earnings. As Ross Gittens so aptly put it in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  on 19 August:</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4928">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So the champion of the poor defines the middle as 67% above average. That's the crux of Mr Keating's betrayal of the Labor battler. The tax cuts are biased in favour of people earning way above the average.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Gittens went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We're always being told that the tax cuts are directed to people earning $20,700 a year and $50,000 a year but often don't realise just how heavily the tax cuts are slanted towards people at the top end of that range.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>I think that was a very timely expose of the general philosophy of&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS>  As I was saying, in quoting Mr Ross Gittens at the time, Labor's philosophy seemed to be to aim those cuts at the top end of the middle range. During this period, the lower middle income earner has been the most disadvantaged. As recently as the 1995 budget the best Labor could do for families was a $4 increase in the guardian allowance for sole parents, a $5 increase in rent assistance and some vague reference to `measures to help families in crisis and through difficult times', as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  of 10 May 1995 so exquisitely put it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose you could say that this legacy of Labor has been a pretty sorry tale. It has shown that the previous government had no soul. In contrast the current government does have a soul. It is looking to the bread and butter issues that Labor so wilfully neglected. Is it any wonder then that at the last election the blue&hyphen;collar workers deserted the Labor Party in droves? Is it any wonder when the Labor Party had deserted the battlers trying to make an honest living and raise a family? Is it any wonder that middle Australia will continue to desert them in the face of a tax package from this government that offers real benefits of a substantial nature&mdash;money in their pockets? The government has not and will not betray middle Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was interested to hear the member for Isaacs say that very few Australians will benefit from these tax measures. That is strange, because the budget papers show that two million Australians will benefit from them. I would have thought that that number is quite substantial and considerably more than the number who benefited from Labor during its term of office.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The family tax initiative will deliver to Australians in two different ways. Part A will provide assistance through an increase in one parent's tax free threshold of $1,000 for each dependent child. Assistance will be available to families whose combined taxable income is up to $70,000 for one child, plus $3,000 for each additional child. These benefits will be available through the Australian Taxation Office. They are also offered with the flexibility of being able to be claimed either during the income tax year through reductions in PAYE deductions in tax or when lodging a return at the end of the financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part B of the family tax initiative provides further assistance to single income families&mdash;including sole parents&mdash;with at least one child under the age of five. The initiative increases the tax free threshold of the breadwinner by $2,500. This assistance is available where the taxable income of the breadwinner is less than $65,000 and the annual income of the non-working spouse is less than the income cut-off for the basic parenting allowance, currently $4,535. Here again the $65,000 threshold is increased by $3,000 for each child after the first.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can see that this measure has been clearly and unambiguously enunciated by the Treasurer (Mr Costello), and I commend him for his work. Certainly one of the strengths of this tax initiative is its simplicity and clarity. There is no deception, no sleight of hand, no smoke and mirror tricks like those which we saw so often during the Keating budgets. What you will get in the coalition budget is a tax initiative which has been delivered in full and will provide genuine assistance for families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unlike the old style Keating&hyphen;Dawkins&hyphen;Willis budgets, this budget does not rely on deception and rhetoric to trick the public into thinking that they are really better off. Unlike those days, this budget really means money in the pockets of real Australian families&mdash;especially, as I said before, those on lower and middle incomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Allow me to be a little more specific about these benefits. As I have said, the tax free threshold increases by $1,000 for one parent for each dependent child for families with <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4929"> combined taxable incomes of less than $70,000, with an additional $3,000 added to the income threshold for each additional child. When you start translating that into some examples, you see that a family with one dependent child on a family income of less than $70,000 will be $7.70 per fortnight better off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A family with two dependent children and a family income of less than $73,000 will be $15.40 a fortnight better off. A family with three dependent children and a family income of less than $76,000 will be $23 per fortnight better off. A family with four dependent children and a family income as high as $79,000 will be $30.80 per fortnight better off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It must be remembered that under the coalition government a dependent child includes all dependent children up to the age of 16 as well as dependent secondary school students up to the age of 18 years. In keeping with the Howard government's commitment to making the tax system more sympathetic to single income families, the second aspect of the tax package initiative focuses exclusively on this group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In real dollars and cents, the second part of the tax initiative will be worth an additional $19.20 per fortnight to those people who are eligible. A family with four dependent children which meets both part A and part B criteria will receive total assistance of $50 per fortnight. I might interpose here that that would be in addition to health insurance rebates which might return to that family anything up to $9 a week or $18 a fortnight. So that family I quoted in the last instance could be up to $68 a fortnight better off as a result of the combined measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This might not sound a great deal of money to people who are living in some of the better suburbs of the capital cities, but I can assure you it means plenty to the working men and women in some of the provincial towns and cities in my electorate&mdash;places like Biloela, Monto, Bundaberg, Gladstone and Childers&mdash;where people work hard in industry or on the land for average or slightly above average weekly earnings. This tax initiative means plenty to these people as they battle with the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mortgage and the never ending expenses of raising a family increase.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know, Mr Deputy Speaker, you will probably find it difficult to believe but this government has delivered still more benefits to families. The family tax assistance initiative which I have outlined is available to all families with sufficient taxable income to benefit. However, this government has also made allowances for around 900,000 low income families who will have the alternative of fortnightly cash assistance benefits, called the family tax payment, to be delivered by the Department of Social Security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I think this emphasises the generosity of the government across a whole range of sectors. I am surprised that members of the opposition have not looked at the detail of this and have been all too willing to be doctrinaire about it. The member for Isaacs talked about the Treasurer being the driest of the dry. I wonder whether he and his colleagues have lost sight of average Australians and have become the doctrinaires of the doctrinaire.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These bills which seek to implement the family tax initiative purport to be of benefit to Australian families. They were the cornerstone of the Liberal Party policy promises during the last election campaign. These are said to be bills that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) takes great pride in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These bills, to my way of thinking, are a classic example of the way in which this government has approached a whole range of policy areas. Its whole approach is based on the premise of give with one hand and take back with the other. We have seen produced here tonight figures which show how much families will apparently benefit, how much they will earn, as a result of these initiatives. What they do not show, and also what the material presented earlier by the member for Dunkley (Mr Billson) does not show, is what is being taken on the other hand: what families are being given with tax breaks on the one hand are being taken away in a whole range of other areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had a bit of description about the higher prescription costs&mdash;$20 per script. There are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4930"> higher child&hyphen;care costs and greater difficulty finding affordable places for babies and children with special needs, increased costs of supporting children who are students and no longer eligible for Austudy  and increased costs supporting unemployed children under 18 who would otherwise have been eligible for a minimum rate of youth training allowance or sickness allowance. So the taking hand of this government I would have to say is much busier than the giving hand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not the case, as the previous speaker, the member for Hinkler (Mr Neville), said, that the smoke and mirrors tricks do not apply. They certainly do apply here. What I want to concentrate on tonight is particularly those families who are using child care. Over half a million children in this country are in Commonwealth funded child care. Child care is of critical importance to a great number of Australian families. An overview in a recent EPAC task force report stressed the importance of `child&hyphen;care services for Australian families and the importance for government to get child&hyphen;care arrangements right'. Under Labor, we had the growth of a world-class system of child care that was high quality and affordable. Most importantly, it was introduced to meet the needs of working women. We recognised that women cannot work if there is not adequate child care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tonight I want to go through five important things about this budget and child care and what it really means for families and explain how, as a result of these changes to child care, the family tax initiative goes nowhere towards meeting increased child&hyphen;care costs. The operational subsidy for community based long day care has been abolished `to encourage services to become more efficient and cost competitive with the private sector'. This is the level playing field argument of the economic rationalists from the other side. It is also the argument that conveniently forgets that community based long day care provides services such as more places for babies and children with special needs, and extended opening hours, just to name a few of the things it does.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the case that some private sector services do provide these services but, on the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> whole, the community based services provide more in these areas because of the operational subsidy. This operational subsidy equates to $14 a week for a child over three and $21 a week for a child under three. Fees for community based long day care are likely to go up by this amount. The alternative to raising fees is cutting services. I just want to read from a little piece&mdash;</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PG6">Ms MACKLIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I was saying that the demand for child care in this country will not be met as a result of the changes in this budget because 5,500 places that were part of Labor's goal of meeting the demand for child care will no longer be met because of this budget. I quote the words of the New South Wales Premier, Bob Carr, who said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Howard is reneging on a Commonwealth-state funding agreement that would have created 1,600 new child-care places in New South Wales alone.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The disappointing thing for families in New South Wales is that a significant number of the places were going to go to high need areas, including western and south western Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA>The third point I want to make is that, if you do not qualify for this much trumpeted family tax initiative that gets completely wiped out by the increased costs of community long day care, your child&hyphen;care cash rebate is going to be slashed by a third. The introduction of the child&hyphen;care cash rebate by Labor recognised that the cost of child care is a work related expense and that it can be a significant disincentive for women thinking about taking up employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like other tax concessions for work related expenses, the rebate was not means tested. Despite a specific promise not to touch this rebate&mdash;another broken promise that we have from this government&mdash;what we have seen in this budget is that the government has in fact applied a means test to the child&hyphen;care cash rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fourthly, changes to child-care assistance, which many parents know as fee relief, mean that all parents will have higher out-of-pocket expenses for child care. The fee ceiling has been frozen, but the minimum fee will continue to increase thereby squeezing the amount of fee relief they might get. The income cut&hyphen;offs for families who have more <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4932"> than one child in care have been reduced, meaning that anyone with more than one child will pay more. The $30 a week of income for each dependent child, which was not taken into account to work out how much fee relief you got, will now be taken into account. You will now have to pay the full costs of any child care you use over 50 hours a week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a look at an example of what these changes to child&hyphen;care assistance actually mean for a family. A couple on a combined income of $35,000 a year&mdash;say, he is a mechanic on $25,000; she is a sales assistant&mdash;with two children in care for 50 hours a week will be paying $29.16 a week more for a community based long day care centre. How much do they get from the family tax initiative? Some $7.70 a week. So they are a lot worse off under this budget. This family tax initiative is certainly not going to compensate for the increase in their child-care costs. There are many thousands of other children and their families who are going to affected in this way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">  Let us just remember what the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) actually said during the election campaign about child-care assistance and the family tax initiative. He said that there would be a family tax initiative, but he also said that a Liberal&hyphen;National Party government would maintain the system of child&hyphen;care assistance. But what is going to happen under this budget is that 330,000 families will pay more for child care because of these changes&mdash;much more than they are going to get from this family tax initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fifthly, parents who use long day care or family day care can now choose to have their child&hyphen;care assistance paid directly to them rather than to the service provider. Child&hyphen;care centres will no longer have the certainty necessary to employ quality staff who provide children with the continuity of care that they need&mdash;a very serious matter for families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I do not want to labour too much the volume and tone of the letters starting to arrive from families protesting at the attacks on child care, but I thought I might just hold up some of the colourful things sent by young children that have arrived in the post today, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> such as these letters from Jacob and family, Nash and family, Melissa, and a number of other children. You can see that the children themselves have put together some very colourful letters trying to get me, people on our side of the House and, I am sure, those on the other side of the House to really try to understand the effect of the combination of the family tax initiative with these very serious increases in fees for child care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The reason the smoke and mirrors are really starting to emerge is that these details have not been clear to parents. It is only as the real picture begins to emerge that the costs are actually starting to be felt in parents' pockets, and we would hope to see a re&hyphen;evaluation of this budget from the other side of the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> This is called a family budget with its family tax initiative as its centrepiece, but I would have to say that families&mdash;particularly families with children in child care&mdash;are just starting to see this budget unravel. The Prime Minister has tried to woo families with this family tax initiative, but as they start to add up the numbers we can see that the small benefits it will give families on the one hand will be taken away on the other. The bonus of the family tax initiative will largely, for most families, not offset the costs that families will face as a result of the rest of this government's cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The Prime Minister said in the election campaign that this was going to be a government for all of us. What he really meant, particularly when it came to families, was that it is for families where one partner is at home caring for children and not for families where both parents work. Let us make this particularly clear. This is a very important point in this debate tonight. This family tax initiative is a direct transfer from families using child care to families where one person is at home caring for children. What it says loud and clear to working women&mdash;and we are now in the majority, in case those opposite have not worked it out&mdash;is, `Don't work or we will penalise you; we will take away your child&hyphen;care assistance.' That, I think, is the full extent of the coalition's attempt to solve the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4933"> unemployment problem&mdash;get women out of the work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Families should not be dazzled by the dollar signs in the family tax initiative. It is the case that if your family depends on public health, public education or child care, or if you have somebody at TAFE or university, or a family member in a nursing home, or if you are trying to find a job, you just will not have those extra dollars, the $7.70&mdash;which will not go very far against all those increased costs&mdash;for very long, let alone have the time to enjoy them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I might just draw attention to fact that it is the case that we know that this will not be the end of the cuts to child care. We have seen in the EPAC child&hyphen;care task force many of the proposals that we know the government is considering, and we have no doubt that there will be further cuts to child care in next year's budget; further cuts to the impact of this family tax initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> It is a very serious matter when the voters in the federal seat of Lindsay are now having a unique opportunity to show the government a cautionary sign. Today I was sent a copy of the flier that the Liberal candidate has just put out on child care. She does not mention a few facts, which I might just put on the record, particularly as they take away from the family tax initiative. This budget actually takes $500 million out of child care. It delivers increased fees for parents. None of these things were in her flier. All parents with children in community based child care&mdash;of which there are a very large number in Penrith&mdash;will be paying $20 a week per child more.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You go out to Penrith like I did last week and talk to them. That is exactly what they will be paying, because the operational subsidy for community based long day care has gone. The 50&hyphen;hour&hyphen;a&hyphen;week cap on fees is going to mean, particularly for the people of Penrith, that their fees are going to rise. If you have two children in care, your fees are going to rise. And they have taken over $100 million away from community based long day care. You cannot expect the councils of Penrith and Blacktown to make up the differences, because that must be what the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> candidate for Lindsay expects. There is no other way in which the costs to parents cannot go up&mdash;unless she is expecting to do what the people of Bathurst do not want to do, which is to take away the meals from the children in child care and take away all the other important things that make child care a high quality service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a government by trial and error, particularly when it comes to families. It is a very serious thing that this budget does to families: giving them tax breaks on the one hand, but very significant increases to their child&hyphen;care costs on the other. They are deplorable cuts to child care, and ones that we will certainly be fighting very hard against.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to raise a concern which has been echoing around certainly New South Wales and, indeed, around Australia over the weekend. That concerns the disastrous Super League decision handed down by the courts last Friday. I do not think this is just a battle between two entrepreneurs and billionaires in Kerry Packer and Rupert Murdoch. Indeed, this is a battle between the history of the game and the public ownership of it, versus the private domination of this game by an individual.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not just a matter of Friday's decision being un-Australian because what it says is that it is okay for a few greedy individuals to withdraw from their contracts, their honour of the game and their commitment to their communities, clubs and supporters in the interests of the dollar. I think it goes beyond that because it goes to the use of our leisure time and the way in which a great many of the fans wish to see the game go ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The distinction is that I happen to be a proud supporter of the South Sydney Rugby League Football Club and the South Sydney Rugby League Football Club belongs to its <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4934"> members. The ground certainly belongs to the community. The Sydney Football Stadium is a publicly owned ground. I did not see Rupert Murdoch waving around cheques worth millions of dollars to contribute when the Sydney Football Stadium had to be built.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am the Vice&hyphen;President of the Friends of Public Football Grounds and we are an organisation which has pointed out that most grounds are not owned by individuals or by Super League. They are the product of the hard work by and large of working men and women in support of their local teams. Super League future club Penrith relies upon the use of Panthers Stadium or Penrith Park, as it was then. In 1988 it refurbished the ground with a $500,000 grant from the state government. Further, it got $350,000 from Footy Tab funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suggest that if Rupert Murdoch is buying that club he should pay back that money into the public revenue. I am very proud that a local council in my electorate, Leichhardt Council, has banned Super League from using Leichhardt Oval at any future time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, the distinction is very much historical. Andrew Moore, the President of Friends of Public Football Grounds, quoted Bill Buckley, the former Chairman of the New South Wales Rugby League, who argued in 1968:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NSW Rugby League is . . . a truly socialist body because it has amassed very little in the way of profits over the past 60 years. The money has all been distributed to the people who make the game&mdash;players, juniors and schoolboys.</PARA>
<PARA>What we have seen in sport in general which will impact on the quality of life of the people we in this parliament should represent is more and more funding at the elite level, at the risk of funding at the lower levels. This places at risk the development of the game, which certainly the ARL has been responsible for and in which the ARL, I believe, has done an outstanding job in recent times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is symptomatic that this is occurring at the same time as the push of the dollar is trying to knock over a number of AFL clubs. The Sydney Swans have been very successful in their move to Sydney, but I certainly support the right of members of clubs such as <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Melbourne and Hawthorn to oppose the mergers. What we are seeing is the development of a real people's movement in support of their local communities and that tradition, and against the profit motives. I am pleased to end my comments tonight by saying that the spirit of these clubs and communities cannot totally be broken. As evidence of that I give the fact that the Newtown Jets, the mighty club, are premiers for 1996 in the Metropolitan Cup in Sydney.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<TIME.STAMP>(10.35 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I take the opportunity to welcome you back to your first adjournment debate after what I am sure was a very successful parliamentary delegation to the Inter&hyphen;Parliamentary Union in Beijing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This evening I want to raise an issue not only as the member for Groom but also as the patron of a local community support group for those affected by myalgic encephalomyelitis&mdash;a big word&mdash;or ME. I am sure the honourable member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson)&mdash;I think I have got it right&mdash;would agree with me on this. ME or chronic fatigue syndrome&mdash;CFS as it is also called&mdash;is a potentially disabling and chronic condition affecting the immune and central nervous systems. There is no known single cause although for many it may be a viral trigger. Some patients may have a sudden onset whilst for others it may be a slow and gradual process with no easily identifiable trigger. It can vary greatly in severity and duration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no specific diagnostic test. It is a complex illness and the list of symptoms can be extensive and profound in the more severe cases. Some of the main symptoms are an inability to concentrate; memory disturbance&mdash;perhaps a couple of those might be appropriate for some members of this House&mdash;spatial disorientation; chronic sore throat, often with recurrent flu&hyphen;like illness; tender and swollen lymph nodes; muscle pain; headaches, which often are very severe; and non&hyphen;refreshing sleep. Other symptoms may include numb or tingling feelings, twitching muscles, sensitivity to noise, blackouts, depression, anxiety, emotional mood swings, shortness of breath from exertion, intolerance <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4935"> of alcohol, decreased libido and occasional impotence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Current research suggests that a dysfunction of the immune system and the central nervous system are involved. The complexity of the illness means that the prognosis can be very difficult to predict. Some patients will make a slow and gradual progress over several years to a full recovery. The majority will make variable progress with relapses which may be severe and prolonged. They may reach 70 to 80 per cent of their former functions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Others remain severely disabled with little progress, needing help with their personal needs. A smaller percentage may deteriorate and be bed&hyphen;bound for much of the time. Peak incidence appears to be in the 20 to 40 years age group, with a slight predominance to females, and cases in young children are increasing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tonight, Mr Speaker, I am wearing a blue ribbon awareness of ME badge and I hope that such an awareness badge, which has its origins in the United Kingdom, will assist with a better understanding of ME, and an acknowledgment that it is a very real and, for many, a very debilitating illness. The consequences of living with ME for the sufferer, the carer and the whole family unit need to be understood.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to pay particular tribute to two pioneering local Toowoomba women, Joan Sheath and Lyn Wilson, both as sufferers and as support group leaders, without whose persistent efforts the community group would not be what it is today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased also that the government is now starting to do something substantive about the problem and that Australia was an active participant in the international CFS awareness day earlier this year. To illustrate, I quote in part from a recent letter to Ms Wilson on behalf of the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge):</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is aware of the concerns of people such as yourself for those who have been afflicted by this debilitating condition and is taking immediate steps to address those concerns.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to outline the fact that the government is now involved in funding, to the extent <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of $200,000 over the next six months, a series of studies involving various colleges throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us hope that we have left behind unreasonable perceptions that this is a condition of the mind rather than the body. This is a debilitating illness which we cannot and should not ignore.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I join with my colleague the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese) in saying that rugby league teams in the western and south&hyphen;western suburbs of Sydney should be given a future. I believe that this parliament can do something to secure that future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Penrith team should not be forced to amalgamate with the Parramatta team. They are very different communities, very different districts. Penrith has a great record in rugby league and it deserves its own club. Of course, the Western Suburbs rugby league team in my electorate of Werriwa is a great inspiration to young people in the Macarthur district.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to see this parliament consider an access regime whereby media barons like Rupert Murdoch and Kerry Packer are not allowed to carve up the game of rugby league according to their commercial interests. We should have an access regime for the broadcasting rights to major sporting events so that the codes are in the driving seat. According to the antics and strategies of Murdoch and Packer, any good that comes to rugby league out of this controversy is merely an accident; it is merely coincidental to their commercial interests. They would put profit ahead of the best interests of rugby league in the western suburbs of Sydney and the great Penrith club and in the south&hyphen;western suburbs and the great Western Suburbs rugby league team in my electorate of Werriwa.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I rise this evening to congratulate the Carr government on its announcement just 48 hours ago of the effective removal of the M4 and M5 tollways in Sydney's west. I note with interest that in this House on 28 May the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4936"> former member for Lindsay, Jackie Kelly, spoke about Bob Carr. She said, `He literally handed the seat of Lindsay to me on a plate.' The plate has gone, the plate has been removed. The only plate she has now is her phoney publicity stunt to position herself in this by&hyphen;election as a fish and chip shop lady.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is it not interesting that the Liberal Party say that they have no truck with Pauline Hanson and her bigotry? But how does Jackie Kelly present herself to the people of Lindsay? As a fish and chip shop lady! That is a phoney publicity stunt, an attempt to associate herself with the views of Pauline Hanson through the media&mdash;an appalling tactic for the Liberal Party to deploy in this by&hyphen;election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people of Lindsay should see through those phoney media tactics. They should also understand that when Jackie Kelly says, `Send a message to Bob Carr', the message has been received. Anyone in the seat of Lindsay in March who voted in the federal election to send a message to Bob Carr on state matters would have appreciated that their message has been well and truly received. The tolls have effectively gone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Carr government, according to the resolution of the New South Wales branch of the Australian Labor Party, is doing the necessary things to guarantee the proper distribution of funding for health services in Sydney's west, despite the vandalism of the Howard government in taking $800 million out of the public health system. It is only Labor that fights these things. It is only Labor that does the decent things for the Nepean Hospital and the Liverpool and Campbelltown hospitals in my electorate. We are doing it to fight off the anti&hyphen;public hospital views of the Howard government in ripping $800 million out of it all to subsidise private health insurance and build up the already bloated coffers and reserves of the private funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Earlier in the House today we had the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) talking about Jackie Kelly's commitment to education. Anyone in the Penrith district knows that that is a sham. Do you know what Jackie Kelly said to a group of school students at a school in her <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> electorate? At their school assembly presentation she said, `A third of you will be unemployed when you leave school.' I can understand why she said that. It was a streak of honesty. Under the policies of the Howard government of ripping away labour market programs, ripping away spending power and ripping away the supporting role of the public sector in employment, of course they have a diminished opportunity for employment when they leave school.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But this is the same former member who had the hide in this House to talk about her military leadership style. What sort of leadership does she give to young people in her electorate when she says, `A third of you will be unemployed when you leave school'? What a stunning admission of the failure of this minister and the Howard government to do something positive on employment. What a stunning admission of the failure of this government and her failure to give hope, aspiration and expectations to young people in the seat of Lindsay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She has no leadership style, no capacity to deliver and, of course, no capacity to send any sort of message to Macquarie Street. She needs to be judged on federal issues: the abolition of university funding for the University of Western Sydney; abolition of the western Sydney orbital road; and the massive loss of operational funding for child&hyphen;care centres. She deserves to be rejected. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The tirade of the speaker opposite, the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), I would like to talk about something constructive and positive. I would like tonight to take the opportunity to highlight the wonderful benefits of the Australian Cord Blood Bank.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the greatest medical breakthroughs in recent times has been the discovery of the benefit of umbilical cord blood. Treatment of serious blood diseases such as leukaemia rely on the transplant of blood stem cells, which <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4937"> are the ultimate grandparents of all blood cells. These stem cells are very rare and are found in high concentration in bone marrow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of the difficulty in isolating stem cells, whole marrow is used for transplants in the treatment of leukaemia. This procedure is difficult for many reasons. Firstly, finding a compatible match is expensive and at best has a one in four chance of finding a suitable donor. Then, if a suitable match can be found, the risk of rejection remains high. Patients have to be prepared for the transplants with heavy doses of chemotherapy and radiation to suppress the body's immune system and to help reduce the possibility of rejection. A bone marrow graft typically involves a team of seven medical staff in an operating theatre. Tragically, all these distressing procedures are more often than not being endured by very young children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All this suffering will soon be a thing of the past. The discovery that umbilical cord blood contains the essential blood stem cells in large numbers brings new hope to thousands of people awaiting bone marrow transplants. A cord blood graft can be done by a single nurse and does not have the difficulties of finding a compatible donor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tragically, at present over 50 per cent of children with cancer have no matched bone marrow donors. At present there is no cord blood bank in Australia and the cost of searching for and transporting suitable product from the USA currently stands at around $28,000 per person, far out of the reach of most Australians in desperate need of this procedure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Cord Blood Bank has been established at the Prince of Wales Children's Hospital to collect, store and freeze stem cells from babies' umbilical cords to be used in lieu of marrow transplants. Under the guidance of Professor Vowels AM, the Director of the Department of Haematology and Oncology, and the Rotary Club of Northbridge, the aim is to establish a cord blood bank of 5,000 frozen cord blood collections within three years and to make the stored blood available without cost nationally and for a fee internationally. Once a cord blood bank is established with 5,000 donors, the running costs <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> would be minimal, as only regular donor replacements and replenishments would be required to maintain the 5,000 blood collections.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To establish the Australian Cord Blood Bank initially $500,000 is required. The previous Labor government showed no interest in this magnificent project. But I am pleased to say that on 13 June this year the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) wrote to Professor Vowels pledging a grant of $200,000 to assist in the development phase in the establishment of the bank. This major commitment from the coalition government, a government which has shown great integrity and compassion, will now allow this dream to become a reality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is still a long way to go and $300,000 has still to be raised. The Rotary Club of Northbridge has embarked on a major fundraising charity dinner and auction on Saturday, 16 November 1996 in the Banquet Hall of the Sydney Convention Centre at Darling Harbour. This event will be opened by His Excellency the Hon. Gordon Samuels, Governor of New South Wales, and Mrs Samuels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is anticipated that 1,500 people will attend at $100 per head and will have the opportunity to bid on a large range of magnificent goods. I believe that range of goods is growing daily. They will range from antiques to holiday packages. Even new cars will be on offer at that auction. It is hoped that over $300,000 will be raised from this one event, and I urge all honourable members to support this function.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Cord Blood Bank will save hundreds of young Australian lives and it will stop the suffering and anguish of their families. This event will make the Cord Blood Bank of Australia a reality.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to being elected to the federal parliament, I was a councillor with the Townsville City Council for some 11 years.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand now that that puts the current mayor in a very difficult position. My understanding is that he is under threat from the deputy mayor. My understanding is that, following the defeat by Frank Tanti in the Mundingburra by-election, the mayor's position is very difficult indeed. My understanding is that the current Labor caucus in the city is considering that perhaps the deputy mayor, Councillor Ann Bunnell, should be the mayoral candidate at the next city council election. If that were to be the case, it would make a very interesting contest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that it is very likely that we will not see the current mayor as the mayoral candidate at the next election. The Labor Party, for some reason or another, are taking quite some time to endorse their candidates. I call on them to settle that matter as soon as possible so that the people of Townsville can decide whether there may well be a change of council at the next election. Mr Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to put that on the record tonight. I wish you a good evening.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, welcome back. I would like to speak this evening about a very important matter for families in my electorate and to Australia generally: the provision of quality community based long day care centres and the provision of Commonwealth funds for operational arrangements for community based child care.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4939">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many members of the House would be aware that very often relevant local authorities have the responsibility of managing and operating very many of these community based long day care centres. In my own electorate of Perth, I have a number of local authorities. They include the City of Bayswater, the Shire of Swan and the Shire of Mundaring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All those local authorities operate community based child&hyphen;care centres in their areas. The Shire of Mundaring operates the Midvale Child-Care and Neighbourhood Centre, which caters for very many families of lower socioeconomic demography in Midvale. The withdrawal of the Commonwealth based operational subsidy for that child-care centre is of course very distressing for local families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That community based child-care centre in Midvale is in the vicinity of the electorate of the Minister for Family Services, the member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan). More of the Shire of Mundaring is in her electorate than in mine. I know that very many members of families from that particular child-care centre have attempted to wait upon her office to get some indication of hopefully a change in the government's attitude in this respect. Very many people in the community generally have waited upon government members, government ministers or former government members in this respect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I was checking the details of local authorities, I was frankly surprised to learn that the local authority which has the largest number of community based long day care centre places in Australia is the City of Penrith. The total grant to the City of Penrith local council for the 17 long day care centres that the City of Penrith operates is $738,056.80. It is proposed that that operational subsidy be withdrawn. The calculation that is being done on behalf of the City of Penrith is that, if that operational subsidy were withdrawn from 1 July 1997 and the direct cost were to be transferred to families through child-care fees, there would be an increase of between $20.35 to $23.50 per child per week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am told that, when families in Penrith became aware of the massive slug and the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> massive increase that the government's decision in the budget in respect of community based long day care centres would have on families, a rally of thousands of local family members marched upon the erstwhile member for Lindsay, Miss Kelly, trying to find the mythical shop where Miss Kelly allegedly works to make the point to her that this is a massive burden which the government is proposing to place on families in Penrith and on families throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The figure is quite staggering. The council of the City of Penrith has 17 long day care centres. The operational subsidy is over $738,000. This government and its candidate at the Lindsay by-election propose to place that burden on families in Penrith, to their great cost.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the amendment proposed by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans), there are a number of references to the impact that the budget measures would have on those who make Australia their country of settlement. The main burden of this budget is, of course, on cost recovery from that sector, but the damage goes deeper because it is compounded with changes to settlement policies which run quite counter to the national interest and also to the interests of those who have made Australia their home.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I begin with the direct budget measures, I suppose an overall summary of the budget would be to say that it takes something over $1 billion from the area of immigration and immigration support, whilst it boasts of spending some $64 million over four years: a net reduction of expenditure in this area of something of the order of $950 million. There are boastful announcements in the budget of trifling additional expenditure, but they are overwhelmed with new charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government says it will spend an additional $17 million on English language programs over four years, but it is going to slug users of those services over twice that amount during the same period. That is a tax on the coalition's commitment, which they proudly boasted before the election would ensure that all migrants would have the opportunity to gain effective communication. The rise proposed to each individual from $2,205 to $5,500 is in fact a deterrent to new settlers learning what the coalition called, before the election, a common language which is the glue of a cohesive nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is planning to raise an additional $16.5 million in migrant health service charges whilst cutting back access. The family reunion program, which the government promised to reject, is cut; yet the costs for visa and other filing applications will yield over $37 million in 1996&hyphen;97. The cost of visitor visas is up 200 per cent, the fee for application for change of status to permanent resident is up 120 per cent, and even the fee to become an Australian citizen has increased.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Spending on multiculturalism, which was formerly the responsibility of the now defunct Office of Multicultural Affairs which was formerly in the Prime Minister's Department, is more than halved. The commitment to work with the Federation of Ethnic Communities Council of Australia&mdash;FECCA&mdash;is at least in doubt. With respect to FECCA, the policy of the government would appear, certainly to most observers, to be no more than that of intimidation. The budget for FECCA has not been resolved. On two occasions now the organisation has been told that decisions relating to its funding are being postponed pending further consideration and further reviews, and the organisation still has had no advice as to whether or not it will have its funding at the end of this year. The minister, in fact, has <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4945"> announced a review which only commences its work in December and the budget for the organisation runs out at about the same time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, at a time when the subject of immigration and the implications for Australia of choices being made by this government are at the forefront of every newspaper, every editorial, every columnist, is holding an axe of funding over the principal body that speaks for ethnic Australians. It is not resolving that and I regard that as a complete travesty and a failure of this government to act in a way which is honourable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Ruddock, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, boasted of adding multiculturalism to his portfolio. In his charter of responsibility on multiculturalism, he has said nothing on this across all portfolios, a practice observed by previous governments. There is nothing in the budget that refers to the way in which the interests and concerns of people from different cultural backgrounds are going to be recognised and respected in the different works of the various agencies. To me, the failure to produce such a document is a stinging indictment of this government's claim to speak for all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to the $10 million promised before the election with respect to racial vilification education, only $5 million is committed, with the rest to follow a `review'. But nothing appears in the forward estimates, which means, of course, that the government is set to break yet another election promise. With respect to a racial vilification campaign, spending $5 million on that is akin to spitting against a hurricane when the Prime Minister has sat mute for so long while the whirlwinds of racial intolerance are fanned. His conspicuous silence remained to such a degree that people of goodwill, even on his own side of politics, felt the need to speak out, and to speak out in terms that can only be regarded as those of the greatest of alarm.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In short, Mr Ruddock is boasting about spending $64 million while, by gutting, slashing and ramping up charges&mdash;and add the recoveries intended to be made, particularly by the extension of the waiting period for two years and a number of other measures announced by the government and implemented in this budget&mdash;he will grab something over a billion dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government proposes that new settlers not have access to a whole range of education, labour market and social security support. They have made, in recognition of the damage that this will cause, a token additional contribution to emergency relief organisations&mdash;private charitable organisations&mdash;to pick up the broken pieces that their policy recognises will follow from that heartless approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not only heartless, it is irresponsible. It is irresponsible because, if one looks at the time when people make a success of coming to this country, forming a new future, building the roots that enable them to go on and make their family's and their own success in this country, the first two years are the critical periods. If there are savings to be made, project them forward. But the first couple of years when people first arrive are inevitably going to be periods when people are most at risk of finding themselves in difficulties. If Australia is unable to provide for them the kinds of opportunities necessary to make effective settlement, to help them find educational skills if their skills do not prove to be adequate, to help them into labour market programs if their hopes are not met by employment&mdash;or help them find some emergency relief if their circumstances do not prove as they hope&mdash;then we are building up problems for the future. We are building up a large store of problems for future generations by what is a short&hyphen;sighted and penny&hyphen;pinching approach.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4946">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real cost to Australians is the serious long&hyphen;term problems this will leave us as our inheritance. To severely restrict access to essential needs for successful settlement in health, education and the opportunity to enter the labour market and be a productive member of society will carry a price we wish we did not have to pay. This is retrograde, myopic and simply bad policy. It makes short&hyphen;term gains at the expense of migrants but risks big problems and high social costs for the future of all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, one of the areas, of course, where the impact is most to be felt is in the area of English language. Successive governments have expanded services available to new arrivals to this country to make sure that people do acquire effective English language skills so that they can make effective settlement. In its pledge before the last election, the coalition criticised the failure of the former government to expand those services adequately and indicated it was pledged to additional funding and to make certain that those services were more readily available to, as they put it at that time, ensure that the glue that makes for our social cohesiveness holds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what do we find in the area of English language programs? What we do find is that in its first budget, the Howard government has announced a 250 per cent increase for access to English language classes under the adult migrant education program. But the fee will rise from $2,205 to $5,500 at 1 January 1997, with an interim rise to $4,405 at 1 October of this year. That has simply put the program out of reach for many migrants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister, Philip Ruddock, fools no&hyphen;one with his announcement of additional funding of $17.6 million over four years. That was a pledged amount the minister claims that was delivered on in this budget. By the time the first instalment of that money is paid in 1 July 1997 the Howard government will have collected $11.6 million in user charges from the same program, up from $2.8 million in 1995&hyphen;96. What you see just in that short period of time, before any money is paid out, is that a collection of $11&half; million will be made and then the additional fees that are being charged will more than double, on a recurrent basis, the new expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The language in the media release by the minister gives rise for concern about the future of the program. He speaks of consultations with migrants, service providers, state and territory governments and the wider community. It seems that this is setting up a preamble for what are now ambiguously called reviews, which are intended to bring to an end programs which the government feels less than comfortable with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from migrants from English speaking backgrounds, many skilled migrants with much to offer our economy will be severely disadvantaged. Again, it is not the individual disadvantage to the particular new arrival that we ought to be most concerned about, notwithstanding that we should all, I think, have a compassionate response to people who have made such a wrenching decision to come from another place and to make their new home in this country as a permanent member of our community. I suspect there is none more traumatic, none more complex than the decision to actually leave the land of one's birth and to move to a new country to intend to become a permanent resident of that country and to face so many great changes that inevitably confront you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Take all those concerns into hand as the individuals battle to make a success of it&mdash;as everyone inevitably does when they make that choice&mdash;as they arrive from overseas; put to one side any compassion for people who themselves will be disadvantaged by the government decisions that will leave them without adequate social security support if, by some <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4947"> misadventure, their hopes prove unfounded. Put to one side any concern about the people who find themselves with a need to improve their training to enter the job market. Put to one side the difficulties people find in playing an effective part in their own communities where they have made their home if they do not have adequate English language skills. But think of the larger long&hyphen;term cost to this community. Think of those long&hyphen;term costs. Penny&hyphen;pinching in this area is intensely counterproductive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The measures that are intended by this government to set up brick walls to those who come here to enter the work force, making access to English language programs more difficult, will lead to consigning many to despair and long&hyphen;term dependence on social welfare. The simplistic justification of full cost recovery ignores the real benefits that such programs produce. The adult migrant education program has a solid track record of success and would be directly responsible for ensuring many new settlers' successful entry to the work force. And, again, the real cost of this bad policy will be manifest in future years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is certainly possible, and ought to be possible, to contemplate a different outcome from this, especially if considered with many other measures proposed by the Howard government. We ought not to use mechanisms of this nature to seek to deter people coming to Australia. The Prime Minister today said that the government remained committed to non&hyphen;discriminatory immigration policies. It hardly makes sense in that environment to create barriers of this nature which plainly will disadvantage people who lack fluent English language skills to make successful settlement. It consigns those now in this country and those to come to great difficulty in making that successful transition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might also, in the little time that is left to me, reflect on the nature of the changes to the program itself. The government has recently introduced regulations which propose profound and unprecedented changes to the way in which Australia will proceed in the selection of those who come to this country. There is relatively little difference between the two parties in terms of the size of the intake. Pandering, I believe, to a sentiment that exists in the community, the Prime Minister has couched his description of that intake as a slash in the migration program, and the Deputy Prime Minister said that the government had taken steps because the program had been out of control. The truth is that the program of the current government is about average for the previous term of the Keating government which, in its own term, was the lowest post&hyphen;war migration period in Australia's history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we have no significant argument about numbers between us, but we do have very significant arguments about the way in which the program is being manipulated. Some people, I think, are already making suggestions to accommodate outcomes which are intended to make it less possible for people from some parts of the globe to come to this country; outcomes which have been designed and manipulated in that deliberate manner. Others are more charitably saying that it simply has that accidental effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But whatever the account of that is&mdash;and that debate will happen in the discussion about the regulations and in wider forums than this&mdash;I think that I should focus on one particular savage decision of the government, and that is with respect to spouses. With no evidence other than the lead&hyphen;out of anecdotal stories of abuse of the spouse arrangements, the government has proposed that from henceforth, the right of Australians to marry people of their own choice will be abridged. It has never happened before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Senate Estimates, it was made clear by officers of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs that there is no evidence of widespread abuse of the spouse visa system. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4948"> And to the extent that sporadic and occasional abuse occurs, I have assured the government that we stand ready with them to act against it. But there is no case whatsoever in a free country such as ours to say to any Australian citizen, or to permanent residents, that the right that they have to meet, marry and choose their partner for their future ought to be abridged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the government is proposing to do is to cap spouse visas. That is to say that, at a particular time, no more Australians will be permitted the privilege of bringing their marriage partner to this country. I regard that as outrageous. And the greatest condemnation of that actually comes not from me, but in the words of the now Minister for Immigration (Mr Ruddock). When legislation which first allowed capping of any visa categories came before the parliament, what he said, with respect to a specific decision to make it plain that that capping could not apply to spouses, was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister has agreed to two specific amendments. One was to exclude the immediate family category&mdash;that is, spouses, dependent children and aged parents. I regard it as absolutely unconscionable for a government to say half way through a year, `We have enough spouses in now, we are going to close off the category and no more people in that category can come to Australia&mdash;no more husbands and wives, no more dependent children, or aged parents'. I am glad that the Minister has made the decision to exclude those groups. We have saved the Government great agony had it persisted in that area.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, it was never the government's intention whatsoever to persist in that area. The amendments were moved to make absolutely clear that no party in this parliament would tolerate that abuse. And now the government in which Mr Ruddock is a minister comes before us to do what he has condemned as unconscionable. It is a disgrace.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Denison has further suggested that the reduction in numbers&mdash;which has bipartisan support, which has been recognised by the opposition as being a responsible view to take of our present immigration policy&mdash;will in some way have racist overtones and lead to an emphasis on migration from one area of the globe rather than another. Let me equally refute that sort of allegation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All that the government has done in relation to immigration in these budget papers is to pick up what has been the call from the former government, in a bipartisan sense, to reduce the number of migrants freely coming into Australia&mdash;not to reduce a particular category. If that were the proposal I would be indignant in my opposition. Mr Deputy Speaker, you know, I know and I believe every responsible member knows, that all the government seeks to do is to offer a fair and internationally defensible immigration policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For that reason I also take issue with the member for Denison. In his opening remarks he has suggested that the two&hyphen;year waiting period proposed for migrants who come into Australia, which will make it more difficult for them to access Commonwealth benefits, is in some way an unfair measure&mdash;as if the government were proposing to take new migrants who come into Australia and deny them access to all benefits without forewarning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple reality is that every migrant coming into Australia beyond this budgetary period knows that they will come in to a two&hyphen;year waiting period. All that the government has said is that the responsibility that every new Australian will face is the responsibility of making provision for their settlement in Australia for a period of two years. It would be very difficult in my electorate, and I suspect in any other electorates across the nation, including the electorate of the member for Denison, to find electors who are offended by that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a large migrant community in my electorate; an electorate which is made up of a number of horticultural crops which are labour intensive and which for that reason have attracted people with a relatively low capital base and a willingness to work. Within my migrant community there is overwhelming support for the proposal that people should wait two years before being able to access these sorts of Commonwealth benefits. Given that my migrant community supports it, you can be sure that most people across the nation feel this is a responsible step and most certainly do not see it as having any of the racial overtones implied by the member for Denison.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been some debate about these appropriation bills being referred to the Main Committee. I want in my opening remarks to say that, given the time that has been spent on these bills in the chamber, the action of the government is entirely appropriate. The appropriation bills are very much about dealing with the economic success that Australia will have and the economic success that the government can generate for the nation over the ensuing 12 months and, indeed, over a longer time frame.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue that, in fact, has been behind all that motivated the 1996&hyphen;97 budget is the question simply of debt. No matter what the former government may say, the reality is that they left the books in a deplorable state and the incoming government has no choice but to introduce a budget that has some unpopular measures in order to address the problem of debt.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4950">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me pick up a quote from the independent review of the budget done by the National Farmers Federation. They said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has been a significant deterioration in the state of Australia's fiscal position over the past seven years. Measured in underlying terms the Budget moved from a small surplus in 1988&hyphen;89 to a peak deficit of $17.1 billion in 1993&hyphen;94. Urgent reform was needed to repair this situation. The 1996&hyphen;97 Budget represents a sensible and well balanced commitment to the Government's objective of achieving a balance in the underlying Budget over the course of the economic cycle. It is likely to boost business confidence, support lower interest rates, and provide the foundation for ongoing low inflationary growth.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not want to take all my debating time simply quoting from the National Farmers Federation, but the document went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Budget strategy clearly identifies one of the major structural impediments to sustainable economic growth&mdash;a high structural current account deficit, as a result of a deficiency in national saving.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There can be no doubt that the deterioration in public finances has been partly responsible for this development. In this context, it is simply not acceptable, after four years of solid economic growth, that Australia should have been running an underlying deficit of over $10 billion.</PARA>
<PARA>This is not the view of the government's Treasurer, it is the view of the National Farmers Federation, which on behalf of the primary producers of Australia was reviewing the budget statement that makes up these appropriation bills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple reality is that as independent a source as the retiring Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Bernie Fraser, has said that there is no more urgent need facing this nation than addressing the underlying debt and removing, so far as possible, the $10 billion deficit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Around this appropriation debate there has been a great deal said about the partial sale of Telstra. Much of this will be addressed later in this chamber and, of course, in the House of Representatives chamber as well. But the simple reality that seems to escape all economic commentators is that the government's enthusiasm for the partial sale of Telstra is entirely motivated not by a proposal to find $1 billion or $1.2 billion to spend on the environment but by a desire to find $7 billion to address our overseas debt and to reduce the overseas debt by something like 10 per cent. What the now opposition cannot escape is that when they came to office overseas borrowings in Australia ran at something like $23 billion, and when they left office overseas borrowings in Australia ran at something like $185 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am the first to concede&mdash;and I would not want the member for Fowler (Mr Ted Grace) to feel that he has been misrepresented&mdash;that of that $125 billion, much of it is made up of private borrowings. But the reality is that, of that $185 billion, probably somewhere between $70 billion and $85 billion is made up of government borrowings. And in order to trim those government borrowings by 10 per cent and so make the economic objectives of the government more achievable, we need the partial sale of Telstra. That is the motivation that has been lost in the nonsense that has been run about using the Telstra moneys for the environment when, in reality, as a member of the government, I want that partial sale to reduce my overseas outlays and so give me an opportunity to realistically reduce interest rates within Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does this budget do? We need to recognise that one of the things that the budget does is to effectively reduce the proportion of GDP that is going to the government. Allow me to quote one paragraph from the Parliamentary Research Service. On reflecting on the budget, the research service under `Outlays' said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Total outlays for 1996&hyphen;97 are estimated to be $129 billion or 25.2 per cent of GDP, compared with $126 billion in 1995&hyphen;96, or 26.1 per cent of GDP. What the government can claim to have achieved while <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4951"> addressing the debt, is to have taken less of the GDP resources and addressed them to government services.</PARA>
<PARA>That is no mean feat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to that, the government has done something about what foreign ownership is effectively undoing in Australia. In 1989, when the previous government was in power, there was something like $53 billion poured into Australia to acquire Australian assets. In 1996, when the previous government was no longer in power, $190 billion had been poured into Australia acquiring Australian assets for foreign ownership. Some of that was the result of policies of the former government. The government, for example, sold such facilities as Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank and so, effectively, injected one way or another additional foreign ownership into Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Critics will say, `But surely the proposal of the now government to partially sell Telstra will also inject additional foreign currency into Australia.' There is some truth in that, but the previous government sold those resources without&mdash;as my statistics illustrate&mdash;reducing the debt. The Howard government commits itself to using the resources of the partial sale of Telstra solely for the reduction of debt. That is a significant difference. We are doing something about pruning our outlays and unless we prune those outlays&mdash;the point made by the National Farmers Federation, and reinforced by Mr Bernie Fraser&mdash;we will bequeath to our children an impossible economic situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am one of those who have a vested interest in the partial sale of Telstra because I happen to represent the electorate in South Australia most served by the Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin. It could be said that I am ignoring some of the opportunities that the environment package would offer for the Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin by putting the emphasis on paying off the debt, but the facts are that this budgetary package targets more money for the Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin, quite apart from the money that will be generated as a result of the partial sale of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An additional $4.5 million goes into the Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin, money that is essentially needed for the Hume Dam, as was highlighted in question time today by the question on the future of the Hume Dam from the member for Indi (Mr Lieberman), who pointed out that there has been a movement in the dam wall that will require further engineering modification. That will cost more money. That puts some of his irrigators at risk as the total capacity of the Hume Dam is run down. While it does not put my South Australian irrigators at risk, it does mean that the flooding that currently exists in the River Murray will extend over a prolonged period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there are additional difficulties. The additional difficulties are simply that we will then have a Hume Dam with a lesser catchment than may be responsible, going into next winter and next summer; a Hume Dam that needs to be filled, if the irrigators represented by the member for Indi are to be assured of their irrigation supply in a year that may not have the same level of rainfall as we have experienced this winter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have focused on those remarks because there is a complication that is a largely related one also occurring for South Australian irrigators. Not many people in this chamber will be aware of the fact that, for South Australian irrigators, Lake Victoria&mdash;which provides the sort of effective safety valve on water availability for South Australia&mdash;has also been run down, because wave action has unearthed Aboriginal burial grounds along the edge of the lake.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The running down of Lake Victoria&mdash;which was done responsibly, to allow for the re&hyphen;covering of those Aboriginal burial grounds with coarser soil at a cost of $1 million, which was provided in the budget&mdash;has had, as with the Hume Dam, a long&hyphen;term adverse affect. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4952"> While Lake Victoria has been run down, 67 years of having Lake Victoria at a particular storage level has meant that water has penetrated the sandhills around the lake, probably for some kilometres. That water is now running back in, so that what is collecting in Lake Victoria is water that is much more saline than any irrigator or any domestic user can tolerate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government&mdash;or, more accurately, the Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin Commission&mdash;finds itself in a delicate balancing act to meet the reasonable demands of the Aboriginal community to have these burial grounds preserved and, at the same time, to ensure that South Australian irrigators do not have a head of saline water awaiting them. I make those comments because, under this budget, money is provided to the basin. As the Hume Dam is run down, the storage of Lake Victoria&mdash;not only for South Australian irrigators but also for New South Wales irrigators&mdash;next year may also be at risk, unless the Hume works can be accelerated and there is adequate rainfall to fill that dam.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HE4">Mr ANDREW</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the member for Indi interjects, it also involves the town water supply and of course, ultimately, Adelaide's water supply. That is important because, as you will all appreciate, the South Australian irrigators are guaranteed a water allocation which comes from Dartmouth, Hume or Lake Victoria as the case may be; so that, while South Australia may be guaranteed that allocation, any shortage of available water in New South Wales and Victoria further exacerbates the problem of the guarantee that New South Wales and Victorian irrigators have. I make these comments to point out the importance of the budget to addressing the whole question of national debt and the fact that the budget has not ignored those principal environmental issues that need to be addressed in the national interest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of other comments I wanted to make, particularly about the supermarket to Asia strategy to encourage the sale of horticultural products in that booming market, and the $28 million to extend the Adelaide airport runway and ensure there is greater access to Asian markets, particularly for my growers and irrigators. I also wanted to comment on the enthusiasm the government has shown for the reform of AQIS and for Australia's quarantine measures to ensure that, within Asia, we have a guarantee that whatever vegetable, horticultural, meat and livestock products are provided come with a blue&hyphen;ribbon guarantee and, equally, that we are secure in the knowledge that any products imported into Australia will not bring with them the pests and diseases that would put at risk our reputation as a clean and green producer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will not go into the other areas because time will not permit. I am partially responsible for that shortage of time, so may I just say how much I welcome the opportunity to support the government's appropriation measures.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the more surprising features of this budget is the extent to which post&hyphen;election revelations were accurate about the condition of the Commonwealth deficit for last financial year; that is, 1995&hyphen;96. Forward costings that were then released demonstrated that the previously concealed effects of expenditure into future years inevitably meant that Labor's legacy would see even more copious bleeding of budgetary red ink unless severe measures to staunch the flow were taken immediately.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the coalition undoubtedly knew before and during the last election campaign that Labor was fudging by concealing the true position, the previous government has given its new successor the near perfect cop&hyphen;out in the eyes of the public. The coalition was handed a rancour&hyphen;free opportunity to abandon a whole raft of election promises. At the same time the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4953"> new government already had the example of Labor over 13 years in government on which to draw. But the true state of the budget for last year, and the deliberate misinformation surrounding it and the forward estimates, makes the coalition's backtracking likely to attract a minimum of political odium.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The danger for all Australians is a perception by the government that, despite its broken promises, it can do exactly what it likes into the future, thereby fulfilling prophecies of arrogance which will match that of its predecessor. Someone will have to curb the Treasurer (Mr Costello) if that is not to happen, and who better than the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). A measure of Australia's tax burden can be seen in the tax takes for the years 1995&hyphen;96 and 1996&hyphen;97.

The `read my lips' tax undertakings are apparently dismissible as not being `core' promises. Labor is equally, if not more, culpable because it provided the excuses now being employed by the government. On behalf of all decent, trusting Australians I say, `A plague on both your houses'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is hard enough to do the job of an elected representative, without being tagged by mere association as an inveterate liar. It is uncontested conventional wisdom that the tax grab on superannuation funds was pounced on at the last moment, given the government's change of heart about the fuel tax rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One can only wonder whether the parliament's virtually unanimous support for an increase in the Medicare tax to buy firearms from the public encouraged the government to go one per cent further, albeit selectively. Why this government continues the charade that encourages the widespread belief that the Medicare so&hyphen;called levy meets the cost of funding Medicare is beyond comprehension. Because it is a tax on income the levy should be integrated into the more progressive income tax regime. It would also be one way of simplifying the tax system.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4955">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both tax hikes in the budget expand the opportunity for future windfalls to revenue by way of bracket creep. It must be a source of despair for government in times of low inflation that the previous bounty from bracket creep is diminished. Perhaps the government realises that, by creating unindexed income brackets where none previously existed, as in the cases of new imposts on contributions to superannuation and Medicare, new growth taxes are there for the taking. But where does it stop? The superannuation funds were already a milch cow under Labor. Now that the coalition has made its initial bid for the lucrative spoils and has set a precedent, what logical impediment is there in the way of a future government of any persuasion to, say, lower the threshold, firstly, to be set at an unindexed income of $70,000 per annum in the case of the super tax? As it is now no longer to be a matter of principle that a particular level of income should be a determinant because the precedent has been set, it becomes a question of how much can be raised rather than whether further income tested imposts can be levied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same concern about the behaviour of a future government surrounds new ground to be broken by partial income testing of the Medicare levy. It is now a pretty safe bet that in the lifetimes of most in this parliament the income threshold in this budget to apply to both the superannuation contribution and the Medicare levy tax hikes will be lowered, or become multi&hyphen;tiered, along the lines of present day income tax brackets. It is a safe bet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, without indexation of the threshold applying to these groundbreaking new tax measures, new elements for growth of revenue by way of stealth, in the form of bracket creep, will have been created. The costs of complying will be considerable but, no doubt, they will be calculated and revealed in the explanatory memorandum accompanying the relevant legislation. These increases, or new taxes, present further incursions into the household component of domestic savings, albeit to the advantage of public sector savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Treasurer has been scathing in comments about the deterioration of the levels of domestic savings under Labor, and with good cause. Yet there is absolutely nothing in this budget which will lead to increased private savings in the near term. The reverse is true. The two measures just mentioned are prime examples.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It might be instructive if the government looked at some of the measures which it could tackle to meet what so far is merely its rhetorical concern. That the plummeting household savings occurred over a period of high inflation and revenue growth induced by income tax bracket creep, in large part, is no mere coincidence. Automatic indexation of the excise on petroleum products was also a factor, along with some pretty hefty imposts on the same commodities by state governments. More insidious, but nevertheless a huge drain on private savings, have been deliberate policy decisions which have brought forward the collection of a whole range of taxes and the associated compliance costs.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the pretext that as many income related taxes should, as near as achievable, be collected on a basis equating with pay&hyphen;as&hyphen;you&hyphen;earn collection, huge private savings were transferred to the public sector, the proceeds of which Labor then blew like a drunken sailor. The budget surpluses of the late 1980s were as much a product of the earlier collection of taxes as of raiding Commonwealth funding for the states. The most notorious example is provisional tax, the uplift factor added, which removed permanently a hard core <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4956"> of billions of dollars from households and small businesses alike. So did the prescribed payment and withholding taxes from business in general.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also contributing to the decline in household savings was the credit card mentality boosted by high inflation which permeated society generally. State and federal governments led the way by example. After all, if governments do not have to occasionally balance the books and spend less than raised, why should mainstream Australia? On top of all that were new imposts, such as fringe benefits and capital gains taxes, which raided domestic as well as business savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So little has been tackled in this budget which will improve what the government itself acknowledges to be totally inadequate levels of domestic savings. Looking at the bigger picture, even commendable relief from capital gains taxes otherwise payable by the proprietors of small unincorporated businesses will be insignificant. Nor will the business sector in general contribute, in the foreseeable future, to the restoration of domestic savings to anything approaching historically desirable levels, some seemingly heroic assumptions about economic growth forecasts in the budget papers notwithstanding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The collapse of the contribution of private sector businesses to domestic savings has gone hand&hyphen;in&hyphen;hand with the raising of new taxes and the earlier collections of existing taxes over the past 13 years. As with household savings, this is no mere coincidence. New taxes such as fringe benefits and capital gains imposts figured even more prominently in depleting the level of savings by the business sector. Even imputation of dividends, accompanied by an arguably offsetting reduction in the income taxing of companies, forced the earlier collection of part of what was formerly payable on company profits in the form of dividends in the hands of shareholders. It brought it forward. Escalating compliance costs, which do not add anything to government coffers&mdash;quite the reverse in fact&mdash;also played a part in depleting business sector savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the wake of what has taken place, and what the government proposes in this budget, any improvement in the levels of domestic savings becomes just another impossible dream. Even if the budget is brought into surplus over the life of the present parliament, it will only result in containment of the federal government's borrowings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of March, Mr Deputy Speaker, the Commonwealth had eaten into domestic savings by borrowing a total of nearly $108,000 million, most of it in Australia. Its appetite and profligacy more than doubled to reach this record high over a paltry three years, the past three years. While the new government can rightly claim its predicament is Labor's fault, it might also, in the interests of transparency, make it clear that it is in no position to do more than contain borrowings to around present levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Such a prognosis might also throw some light onto the prospects for reducing our overall international indebtedness. No matter what gloss anyone might care to put on it, the net national debt could be around $200,000 million at the end of this government's first term&mdash;assuming there is no early election. It is no consolation to know that that figure could be halved, to manageable levels if, by waving a magic wand, the government's own borrowings could be eliminated overnight. But that is a measure of the significance of those government borrowings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is, however, with balance of payments deficits still running well in excess of $1,000 million a month, any fiscally responsible government faces pure hard slog. Whatever the spin doctors in either the government or opposition may say, this budget represents a very <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4957"> small beginning in getting our fiscal affairs in order. It will be an even smaller beginning if some of the forecasts underpinning projected income or expenditure are not up to expectations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To put concerns about forecasts into some perspective, the three&hyphen;year plan to bring the budget into underlying surplus is accepted as immutable. The underlying balance estimates call for the deficit last year of $10,317 million to reduce this year to $5,649 million and in 1997&hyphen;98 to reduce to $1,548 million, and for a surplus in 1998&hyphen;99 of $957 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Major deterioration of either the revenue or expenditure assumptions, or both, is more likely than an improvement in either or both. This is because forward estimates for the current and ensuing years are at the end of the scales most favourable to the desired outcome. For example, estimated economic growth over the three years, essential to projected revenue forecasts being met, could hardly be higher, and historically they are unattainable at this time in the economic cycle, which is arguably on the wane.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, while the short term&mdash;that is, 12 months or thereabouts&mdash;assumption for inflation seems reasonable, estimates of wages growth are possibly optimistic over both the short and medium term. Most regrettable of all, the human tragedy of unemployment is unlikely to be alleviated over the government's first term as it grapples with Labor's legacy. The Treasurer has predicted that there will be no improvement over the short term. More likely, unemployment will get worse before, or if, it gets better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To summarise, forecasts for economic and incomes growth, as well as for unemployment, are, if anything, on the sides which promote the best possible budget outcomes, both for this year and ensuing years. Normal prudence in any other field of endeavour would require best&hyphen;case and worst&hyphen;case scenarios and mean averages to be adopted as the bases for forward planning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like those before it, this budget and the accompanying rhetoric present the rosiest possible picture. A more responsible approach might be to present both worst&hyphen;case and best&hyphen;case forward estimates and outcomes, and not just the latter. More prudent still would be projected outcomes based on the averages of the highest and lowest in an expected range of movements in the rates of economic growth, employment, wages and the like. As it stands, the risks associated with the key forecasts which underpin assumptions about budgetary outcomes over the next three years are, to use the vernacular, all downside risks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the more pleasing features of the budget is the government's reaffirmation of an election promise to legislate for a `charter of budget honesty'. When the next election is called, Treasury estimates of the then current condition of the budget, along with forward estimates, will be published. The sort of nonsense witnessed in the past, when governments changed hands and new administrations blamed their predecessors for concealing independent estimates, should not be possible in the future. The voting public will not then have to endure so many broken promises, excused because the incoming executive did not have an accurate picture of the state of the Commonwealth's accounts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although adoption of a charter will have the effect of the opposition not announcing detailed policy until an election is under way because its promises cannot be costed either in quantum or for effect, that is also not necessarily a bad by&hyphen;product. More honest campaigns should ensue. If so, it will not be easy to break promises post&hyphen;election because of some real or perceived misconception about the true state of our fiscal condition.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the endorsement of a charter of budget honesty by the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher). As we know, the budgeting <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4958"> situation that we find ourselves in at the moment is due to the true nature of the deficit being concealed from the coalition prior to the election. It is a situation which we look forward to not being repeated, come the next election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also note that the member for Curtin was speaking about income tax reform. While there is certainly a mood around Australia, as noted by the forum that was held in Canberra last week, John Howard, as the coalition leader prior to the election, did go to the election with a basic promise of no tax increases and I believe that, by and large, the core commitments that he made were certainly upheld.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, the three promises that I believe were critical in the lead&hyphen;up to the last election were to get our small business back on track by recognising that small business is the engine room of Australia's job creation program; to recognise the worth of the family unit; and, finally, to put young people back into jobs and address youth unemployment. Those three major commitments were made prior to the election. Those three commitments, I believe, have been well and truly addressed in this year's budget. I wish to speak to those three points.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the budget was presented on 20 August, time and time again the opposition has accused the government of being ideologically motivated, as though the coalition's ideology were the antithesis of the values of social decency, caring for families, creation of employment, and protection of the genuinely needy in society. Members of the opposition have been attempting to portray those who created this budget as hardened conservatives, in some way out of touch with the needs and aspirations of mainstream Australian society. Of course, nothing could be further from the truth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a budget for all Australians, and the Labor Party knows it. After 13 years of Labor, Australia's poor are poorer, the rich are richer, and the unemployed and disadvantaged continue to surface. We are presented with this disaster as a fait accompli. We are told, `It was inevitable.' Labor Party politicians, some suffering from relevance deprivation syndrome, claim they have all the answers. If this is the case, why did they not implement policies to fix the problems while they had the chance? They had 13 years: they had their chance, and they failed during that time. It is time to move over and let the new government have its chance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is better served by the coalition. We offer real and practical solutions. The 1996&hyphen;97 budget is a key part of the new government's strategy to meet its election commitments and to restore and improve the economy. Of course, we could have devised the most lax, expensive and extravagant budget in this country's history. We could have maintained a policy of fiscal irresponsibility, which was becoming something of a tradition for the Labor government. But we were elected to solve the problem that Labor had left us: namely, a $10 billion bankcard debt, a debt which is damaging our economy in the same way that Labor's regressive industrial relations policy is destroying jobs, even as we speak.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We agreed to solve the problem, and we agreed to do it fairly and with a view to helping those who were hardest hit by Labor's policies: Australia's families, small business and the unemployed&mdash;in particular, the young&mdash;who have been neglected in our society. Much was made by former Prime Minister Keating of the 20 consecutive quarters of growth, yet no tangible progress was made in helping the Deakin community. There have been no long&hyphen;term benefits; none of Australia's alleged prosperity has trickled down to the people of Deakin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor claimed 20 steps forward while the Deakin community was forced to take a hundred steps back. It went backwards as it watched our national income fall from 10th to 22nd in the world. It went backwards as the self&hyphen;proclaimed workers party claimed to be hard at work for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4959"> the people of Australia while 14,000 businesses went under in 1994&hyphen;1995. It went backwards as businesses struggled to pay off loans at around 20 per cent&mdash;and these were the same businesses that could have created jobs for those one million Australians who were left unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my electorate of Deakin young home buyers were discouraged from buying because they could not afford to meet the skyrocketing interest rates which increased by 17 per cent. That resulted in repayments going up by over 50 per cent&mdash;from $674 to $971 per month. As someone who has just increased their mortgage drastically in the last couple of weeks, I know just how much that sort of an increase can mean to the hip pocket&mdash;it hurts. And the people of Deakin were hurt. Yet the coalition, which is determined to help such people, is referred to as `economic rationalists without a heart'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor government foisted onto Australia program after program, one gimmicky policy after another. You name it, the people of my electorate have copped it&mdash;the accords, One Nation, Working Nation, employment initiatives. The more the names changed, the more the underlying social and economic injustices remained the same. On the way we experienced the worst economic recession since the Depression. All this while the party that was supposed to uphold the rights of the working classes was saying, `Sorry, mate, it is the recession we had to have.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ALP claims that, in government, they did a wonderful job; that no outgoing government has ever left an economy in better shape. The hundreds of thousands of Australians who are unemployed, many of whom recently voted for the coalition, know the Labor government had become reactionary, bent on defending the status quo which did nothing to eliminate social and economic injustices. If delivering a budget that lays a foundation for a more stable and secure Australia means criticism from those interest groups, so be it. The only justifiable accusation to be levelled at the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is that they had the guts to deliver a socially and economically responsible budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let it be said that, in this budget, the coalition has reaffirmed its commitment to Australian families. The people of my electorate of Deakin, along with other Australians, will benefit from the coalition's pro&hyphen;family stance. The Prime Minister promised to help families and the budget delivered on that promise. It is a recognition that the family unit had been neglected for too long by Australia's political leadership. As one commentator succinctly expressed, `the Australian family can now come in from the cold.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition's approach to family assistance as outlined in the budget is not an empty, rhetorical ploy, but a strong, unequivocal recognition of the importance of providing a society in which the family unit can flourish and reach its full potential. The centrepiece of this commitment is the family tax initiative in which families receive a $1,000 increase in their tax&hyphen;free threshold for each dependent child, while one income families will receive a further $2,500 increase in their tax&hyphen;free threshold if they have a child under the age of five. This is a socially responsible and compassionate approach to the hardships faced by families&mdash;and my electorate has more than its fair share of families who need all the support they can get.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A report today by the University of Canberra's National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling has determined that the vast number of Australian families will benefit from the coalition's family tax initiative. The report concludes by saying that 71 per cent of families will see their weekly incomes increased; that is, their PAYE tax deductions will decrease. The government recognises the additional costs of raising a family and we have delivered on our <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4960"> promise to families. The report goes on to say that the initiative will not benefit wealthy families. In fact, 40 per cent of gains will be made by families in the bottom 30 per cent of incomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once again the government is accused of presenting a slash and burn budget which neglects its social responsibilities. It is hard to understand the logic of such accusations when the government has met its election commitments in areas such as superannuation, involving an 18 per cent rebate to individuals who make superannuation contributions on behalf of spouses with low incomes; low incomes, not high incomes. For example, the government will allow banks and other financial institutions to assist low income earners by providing retirement savings accounts; these will benefit from the same taxation benefits as other superannuation products. Furthermore, the government is assisting these same low income earners by increasing the threshold of employer contributions under the super guarantee charge from $450 to $900 per month. This measure helps those who need the money now and were unlikely to benefit from the small super contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget also enables parents to have access to affordable child care. It is a budget that makes an extra $31 million available over four years to help children with special needs to gain access to quality child care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this is a slash and burn budget then my electorate of Deakin, after 13 years of Labor mismanagement, has through its words and action given it its stamp of approval as a responsible budget and a fair budget. Yet Labor's campaign of misinformation has had its effect, to the point that certain groups in my electorate have put forward the view that budget changes will hurt parents. Let me state categorically that they will not. For example, the removal of the operational subsidy for community based long day child-care centres effective from July 1997 simply addresses the imbalances between the community sector and the private providers of child-care services. The subsidy was introduced in the mid&hyphen;1980s to assist the community and since then there has been an explosion in the number of places provided by the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Young families that are facing the burden of buying their first home will be extremely sceptical of claims by the opposition that this is an uncaring and unsympathetic budget. What young families will be quick to notice is how the government's fiscal responsibility and readiness to tackle the nation's debt will gradually lead to an environment in which interest rates will come down and the country will approach the level of certainty. Young families will be certain that their children will be able to grow up in a fair Australian society; a society which will have achieved a degree of sound fiscal responsibility. In fact this fiscal responsibility is already demonstrating itself. Since the election we have witnessed a drop in home interest rates delivering to mortgagees a saving equivalent to approximately $80 per month. I certainly expect this trend to continue and, as the economic forecasters indicate, there could very well be a further drop between now and the end of the year. This is the effect of a sound and responsible budget creating an environment of fiscal responsibility in which there can be great faith in our future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, in the time I have left I would like to speak to the issue of employment and unemployment. I am glad to be able to inform the unemployed people in my electorate of Deakin that the days of ineffective employment strategies are well and truly over. This government will end the strategy put in place by the previous government which saw expensive programs being funded by the taxpayer, without the certainty and often even the hope of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4961"> making the unemployed any more employable. In fact, if there was anything heartless, it was the heartless nature of Labor's programs which created an air of expectation that at the end of the day there was a job. But at the end of the day there was no job, at the end of the day there was another program and another program, and so we found ourselves on Labor's merry&hyphen;go&hyphen;round training programs. Our approach focuses on individuals and their needs, not on programs or program objectives. It is a person's need that is far more important as to whether or not money will be expended and in what form that money will be expended, not whether or not a specific program in itself should be justified. We will help people when they need it. Labor's approach to impose a 12&hyphen; to 18&hyphen;month delay on receiving labour market assistance was a major mistake. The coalition will not repeat this error by Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition, far from being opposed to quality workplace training, is actually proposing a set of initiatives that will help get this country's long&hyphen;term unemployed into the work force, something that is of particular concern to my electorate, in which youth unemployment is a constant cause of concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One hundred and eighty seven million dollars will be provided over the next four years to assist the transition from school to the workplace. I consider this particular program to be one of the most exciting initiatives in the budget&mdash;one of the unsung aspects of our budget. The school to work program will ensure that young people are not left stranded once they have left school. This program is part of the government's new Modern Australian Apprenticeship and Traineeship System, which is part of the process of the reform and streamlining of Australia's training system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Loss of apprenticeship opportunities over the last 13 years have been phenomenal and, in part, we have had both the former Labor state government of Victoria, and, certainly, the federal government, to blame. The old system of technical schools in our state, which gave hope to young kids who did not want to be streamed into university, has disappeared, thanks to the Cain&hyphen;Kirner governments. The former government's approach in terms of moving people away from apprenticeships and into the labour market training program has continued that decline.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the heart of this $187 million four&hyphen;year school to work package lies the allocation of $80 million to expand vocational education and training in secondary schools; $40 million for workplace training opportunities for students; and $38 million for up to 200 work placement coordinators to facilitate structured workplace learning opportunities for students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my electorate they are lining up to be work placement coordinators. In my electorate the schools are approaching me to find out more about what is happening in terms of the school to workplace program. They are excited by it. I know that the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford), who is on the same committee as me&mdash;the Employment, Education and Training Committee, which is looking into youth employment&mdash;also realises, from some of the comments that we have received through our investigations, that there is an air of expectation that the school to work programs will be addressed, and that the transition from one environment to another will be given prominence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Young students who are not planning to go on to university will be looking for an apprenticeship once they have completed year 12. They will be given the opportunity to gain valuable experience in the workplace while completing high school. It is an exciting program which I certainly fully endorse.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4962">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From my own experience in meeting with the people of Deakin, I am convinced that young people are looking for real training that leads to real jobs. Apprenticeships have for many years provided valuable opportunities for young people and the businesses employing them. The system has worked well for generations of Australians and it is important that they continue to function for years to come. It is imperative that this government be allowed to give a new lease of life to the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party, I am sure, will be surprised to examine the detail of such schemes; they are a genuine attempt to offer real opportunities to Australia's youth and to reveal a dignified way to enter the work force for those who are enthusiastic to work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In closing, let me assure the people of Deakin that, contrary to recent Labor rhetoric, there is no hidden agenda behind the government's policies; there is simply a commitment to create jobs for the unemployed, and a better working environment for those already employed. The budget is central to Australia's fiscal turnaround and its economic renaissance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the previous government dilly dallied and promised substantial reform, which it was unable to deliver due to union pressure, the coalition has courageously set out a plan for the future of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, furthermore, has announced in the 1996&hyphen;97 budget broad design details of its commitment to provide capital gains tax rollover relief to small business. This measure will apply to capital gains tax otherwise payable on asset disposal on or after 1 July.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's policy will see the amendment of the tax act so that equity investments in small and medium enterprises made by leading institutions after 1 July may be taxed under the capital tax provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, I am glad to inform you that small business in my electorate reacted positively to the taxation election commitments that this government has either implemented or is in the process of implementing. The government has reduced the provisional tax uplift factor from eight per cent to six and it has announced an increase in the fringe benefits tax minor benefits threshold to $100. The small business deregulation task force will soon report with plans to halve the paperwork and the coalition will not proceed with Labor's proposal to force subcontractors into the PAYE net.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, the Australian people reacted positively to the budget. They understand that the only way out of the political quagmire we are in is through a readiness to take responsibility for the disastrous situation we have inherited from the previous government. It is encouraging to know that we have been able to get the budget message across in spite of the misinformation about the budget in the community and the opposition party's opportunistic scaremongering. Mr Deputy Speaker, I know that the people of Deakin look forward to this budget being passed, not only in the lower house but also in the upper house.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say that aspects of this first budget by the conservatives in 14 years are very disturbing. My view can be summarised in saying that this budget is short on fairness and full of prejudice. It is a budget that has been driven by opinion polls. It is a budget that this government has at every opportunity gone out and sold by attacking the soft targets. Never before have we seen in the lead&hyphen;up to a budget ministers making announcements in the manner in which they have done. In particular, we saw the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) give a doorstop <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4963"> press conference where he released a two&hyphen;page press statement and then scuttled back into his office, and the next we heard of him was a couple of days later on the John Laws program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tragedy was that on the same day that he announced that there would be some $470 million over four years cut from the ATSIC budget we had an announcement by the Deputy Prime Minister, Tim Fischer, that the miners and the farmers would retain their diesel fuel rebate. The diesel fuel rebate in its totality offers concessions in the order of $1.2 billion per year to the miners and the farmers&mdash;more than the whole of the ATSIC budget. You see, it is sending the wrong signals. The indigenous community are prepared to suffer cuts that are fair, that are equitable, that are across the board, but these cuts to the ATSIC budget are none of that. They are targeted at the most vulnerable and disadvantaged section of the community, while at the same time the more privileged sections of the community are spared cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this budget we have the defence sector immune from spending cuts. The cuts should be across the board. The pain, if it is to be borne, should be borne equally. But this government has picked the soft targets and has fed into people's prejudices. Instead of learning from the mistakes of history, this government seems to be compounding the mistakes of history. It is worth quoting the words of Pastor Martin Niemoller, a Lutheran minister who was a critic of Hitler and the Nazis. What Niemoller said summarises what I think has been the attitude of this government since it came to office, frankly. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They came for the Communists, and I didn't object&mdash;For I wasn't a Communist; They came for the Socialists, and I didn't object&mdash;For I wasn't a Socialist; They came for the labor leaders, and I didn't object&mdash;For I wasn't a labor leader; They came for the Jews, and I didn't object&mdash;For I wasn't a Jew; Then they came for me&mdash;And there was no&hyphen;one left to object.</PARA>
<PARA>The great tragedy is that this is not what the people were promised prior to the last election. They were promised that if John Howard were elected to the prime ministership he would have them feeling comfortable and relaxed by the year 2000. They were promised that this would be a government for all of us. The government for all of us quickly became a government for only some of us. It didn't include indigenous people, it didn't include migrants, it didn't include the unemployed, it didn't include public servants, it didn't include unionists, it didn't include the ABC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From day one, this government picked what it thought were the soft targets. That is a great tragedy. There is a sense of betrayal in the community. The cuts to the ATSIC budget were savage. They were not warranted. Again, in an answer to me in question time today, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) conceded that members of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community are amongst the most disadvantaged people in our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The measure of a political party, the measure of a government, the measure of a society is how it treats the vulnerable and the disadvantaged. This is a march down the American path. The American path is simple. It is a classic conservative, divide and rule path. It is a dog&hyphen;eat&hyphen;dog situation&mdash;bash the blacks and keep defence immune from spending cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cruellest decision that this government made in the budget in relation to indigenous people was what it did to the community development employment program. John Howard talks about mainstream Australia. The Prime Minister says, `This is what the majority of people think.' It is fair to say that the overwhelming majority&mdash;the white, Anglo&hyphen;Saxon and Protestant section of the community&mdash;believe that people should work for the dole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The CDEP is basically a work for the dole program, but it is only the indigenous people who are required to do that. They do it welcomely, because it helps their self&hyphen;esteem and it <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4964"> helps the infrastructure in their remote communities. It provides an incentive for the local community to band together where there are no jobs. The cost of CDEP is an extra 30 per cent on top of unemployment benefits. So they work for less than the dole, but funding allows for infrastructure development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this budget, the government has frozen the expansion of CDEP, the work for the dole program. Instead of allowing for the extra 2,500 places in CDEP, the government has allocated the money for unemployment benefits. It is madness. It is an absurdity. It seems to me that the attitude of this government is to say, `If the Labor Party was involved in it, then we need to change it because it can't be any good.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the history of CDEP? ATSIC outlines the history in the attachment to its press release, and it is worth reading. On the bottom of page 5 of the attachment it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Community Development Employment Scheme was introduced on a pilot basis for remote Aboriginal communities by the Fraser Government in 1977 in response to those communities concerned that large scale payments of unemployment benefits would be both unproductive and cause considerable social problems. It has evolved into a scheme in which over 27,000 indigenous Australians voluntarily forgo their rights to Job Search Allowance (JSA) or New Start Allowance (NSA) to participate as employees in 262 CDEP projects throughout Australia for a wage that is approximately equivalent to JSA or NSA entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More than 25% of working age indigenous Australians participate in the scheme and more than 60% of new jobs for indigenous Australians between 1991 and 1994 were created through expansion of CDEP. During the same period the CDEP scheme was responsible for the creation of 5,500 of the total 8,000 new jobs for Indigenous Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The scheme benefits</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Communities by generating a sense of pride in ownership and control and helps address a wide range of social issues such as long term unemployment, dislocation from mainstream labour market programs, substance abuse and habitual offending.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Individuals by providing a transition to work, access to flexible training programs, helps to establish self esteem and a sense of cultural identity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Governments by providing for municipal services, particularly in remote communities, where local government is unable or unwilling to provide services and is critical to other service providers in the delivery of services to remote communities at outstations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The impact of not proceeding with the planned expansion will be felt both in the short term and the long term in respect of all the benefits identified above. More especially the cuts come at a time when the indigenous labour force is growing at 8,000 per annum. The likely impact is that indigenous unemployment will increase sharply as a result of this measure over the next four years.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>They then go on to talk about recent studies. And that is the great tragedy and the great irony. We are told that this government is going to concentrate on health, on unemployment and on housing. This is integral and it is related to those concerns, especially in regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Studies by Professor Colin Tatz from Macquarie University show that if you take away infrastructure spending or if you do not have community or cultural activities in remote Aboriginal communities, then those communities have an increase in youth suicide; they have an increase in delinquency; they have an increase in alcohol related problems; and they have an increase in health related problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What worries me is that seven months into a new government we have a government apportioning blame, not a government coming down with a considered program, not a government coming down in this sensitive area with policies that have any long&hyphen;term benefits. This was a program that was created by the Fraser government. We acknowledged, when we <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4965"> were in government, the benefits of the program and we expanded it. In the mainstream community's view it is work for the dole. And, what have we got? The government is discarding the expansion of the program and just allocating the money for people to receive unemployment benefits. That is not helping anyone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a problem in a number of other areas as well. The tragedy is that not a lot of people are listening. There is anxiety in the community; there has been so much change that people are concerned, and they are looking for the simple solutions&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I was saying before the division, it is worth quoting again from the ATSIC press release of 16 August 1996 as to what the ATSIC board had to do when, in effect, the minister announced these cuts and then said it was up to the ATSIC board to determine where the cuts would occur. I said at the time that what the minister was doing was handing the ATSIC board a poisoned chalice because there were already criticisms of ATSIC from within. To then turn around and say to the organisation, `We are going to impose $470 million worth of cuts but you are going to pick where these cuts are going,' is the wrong principle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister might argue that this is in accordance with the principles of self&hyphen;determination. What should have happened was that the ATSIC board should have been consulted on where the cuts were to be made. There should have been recommendations but the minister should have worn the responsibility for where the cuts would take place. Instead, what he has done is leave the ATSIC board open to criticism from within the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the other measures mentioned in the press release following the government's announcement. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the ATSIC board had reluctantly concluded it was forced to terminate the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the Community Training program, which means that ATSIC will have no labour market program other than CDEP;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the Movement to Award Wages program, which means that ATSIC will no longer be able to supplement those organisations moving their indigenous staff to award wages; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the Community and Youth Support program, which will effectively remove from ATSIC responsibility for assisting indigenous organisations providing community and social services to Aboriginal people. It is now the total responsibility of Commonwealth and State agencies to provide needed community services and welfare to indigenous people.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>There is something else that needs to be said. ATSIC has only been in existence for a couple of years, since the early 1990s. There is a perception that ATSIC provides all the services to the indigenous community. It does not; it only provides part of the services. The red tape and the accountability that ATSIC has to observe are just double standards compared to what we ask of the rest of the community. The guilty parties in terms of the lack of services going to the indigenous community are state and territory governments. Where is the accountability for those governments in terms of providing essential services that we, the rest of the community, take for granted? We only allowed ATSIC to administer health services for a four&hyphen;year period. We took them away from it in the end after consultation with the ATSIC board and the services were picked up by the Department of Health.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4966">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There needs to be a coordinated whole of government approach to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander problem in this country. It is not only the nation's eyes that are watching John Howard as Prime Minister, it is going to be the world's eyes, given that we are hosting the Sydney Olympics in the year 2000. Like it or not, there is a concern in the broader community. It might be popular in the short term to pick these soft targets that the opinion pollsters tell you, `That is going to go down well with those battlers who switched their vote on 2 March,' but over time the government is going to run out of alibis. They have had seven months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember the press conference that was held by the Prime Minister after the first cabinet meeting with the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. We were told about the expose on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program. All this time on, there has not been shown to be any substance in those allegations&mdash;allegations that were actually pursued by the ATSIC office of evaluation and audit itself. There has been no evidence of widespread corruption, but evidence of problems in terms of some areas of administration in answering letters; technical breaches, as they are called.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had a situation where the ATSIC organisation has been forced to pay $1.4 million to meet the cost of a special auditor. That was part of the first cabinet decision. A couple of weeks ago that decision to impose a special auditor on ATSIC and those organisations was struck down as illegal. The minister was acting outside the powers given to him under the ATSIC Act&mdash;a 3&hyphen;0 decision by the Federal Court. Yet ATSIC was still required to pay the $1.4 million for that special audit, that illegal audit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party has no problems with accountability. We have no problems with the proper accounting of public funds. The situation is that the way this government is going, in this area and a number of other areas, is all opinion poll driven. It is telling people what they want to hear. It is portraying, with the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson), this false prophet, that things are simple, that they have simple solutions. They are not and they do not. They are complicated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We live in a humane and compassionate society. Australia is a fairer society than the United States was under Reagan and under Bush. It is a fairer society than Great Britain was under Thatcher. We do not want to go down the Thatcher path, down the Reagan path. As conservatives are getting turned out of office around the rest of the world, we took a different course. It will not take the Australian electorate long to wake up. There are no simple solutions, and in this area what is required is empathy and sensitivity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have said time and time again since I have been a shadow minister that the Labor Party is prepared to play a constructive role with the government. We acknowledge that there is a new government in town, but we do not accept the way it is going in this area. It is a government without compassion. It is a government that does not have the solutions and it is a government that should take heed. It should count to 10 and pull back a little bit. It has been knocked over in the courts already and I think it will not withstand scrutiny. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One always listens to the learned and gallant member for Banks (Mr Melham) with concern and interest, and also in appreciation of his sincerity in matters of this nature. But, I must remind him, since he mentioned Professor Colin Tatz, that it was Professor Tatz&mdash;was it not?&mdash;who made a visit to Aboriginal communities in 1971, I think, and found them in an absolutely deplorable situation. About 20 years later <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4967"> he  made another visit to those communities and found an even worse situation. That is something that cannot be ignored in looking at these sensitive issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The policies over those 20 years involved, in many cases, doling out money without looking for achievable goals and without determining that what we need is outcomes&mdash;not just spending and telling people to take the money and go away. We really have to look at the history, certainly of the government that he was part of&mdash;a member of the backbench, I think, at that stage&mdash;during that 13 years, and, in particular, we also have to look at the overall history of Aboriginal spending.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To say that we have to look at it is not to say that we have any predisposed ill view towards Aborigines. It is an absolute outrage and an insult to suggest that we, on this side of the House, do not have compassion and caring towards that very disadvantaged sector of the community. But, in so far as ATSIC is concerned, any organisation that spends $140 million of its something like $800 million budget on administering itself, in an area where money is as scarce as it is in this area, has to be looked at carefully and there has to be a thorough examination of whether or not that sort of money can be spent in really uplifting the lives of Aborigines on the ground. In that respect, and in principle, I support money going in at the bottom and not money going in at the top. That is all I wish to say in relation to some of those remarks by my honourable friend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget, in my view, has been accepted widely in the community as a good budget. It is a budget that has had to take hard decisions, but it also is a budget of forward thinking in relation to some particular areas of interest that I have, notably the training initiatives and the focus on moving towards the expansion of vocational education in schools, and, in particular, the recognition of the need for greater apprenticeship and traineeship opportunities. It is interesting to note that $187 million is going to be developed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my own electorate of Dickson, the Pine Rivers High School has already, to some extent, been a beneficiary of the new focus towards developing, enhancing and expanding this latent opportunity. When a school like Pine Rivers has expensive machinery sitting idle between the hours of 3.00 p.m., after school finishes, and a reasonable hour for training, something like 10.00 p.m., and on holidays and weekends, and we have people out there who need training, it is absolutely incumbent upon us to try to utilise that equipment after hours. We must use it, as well, obviously, in relation to training in schools. The after hours use, which is part of the program that Minister David Kemp mentioned in parliament recently, is going to be taken advantage of in this particular area, and I applaud the direction of the government in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also important to realise that difficult decisions had to be taken in the overall budget context. The expenditure side of the equation had to be carefully looked at. However, in doing so, we must not be too blinded in looking for the black figure. There are groups of people out there&mdash;and I know this from representations that have been made to me in my electorate&mdash;who are largely being forgotten.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These people have worked for something like 30 years in the Australian Public Service or perhaps in industry. They have suddenly found themselves out of work due to rationalisation or changes to industry structures&mdash;or whatever fancy terms are applied. One cannot help but be extraordinarily moved when confronted by these people who are the victims of the new age of rationalisation and reorganisation of companies, government departments and so forth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These people have intrinsic worth and intrinsic value. They have great skills and great wisdom. It is absolutely shocking that people have reached an age where they have so much <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4968"> to contribute, have learnt such a lot, and yet suddenly find themselves victims. This has not just occurred recently. Indeed, one particular example goes back something like 18 months, but the process is unfortunately coming to fruition for this particular constituent fairly soon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over a period of time he has been, as it were, wound down and shunted into a particular area. It is a bit like what happens to old rolling stock. They are gradually shunted around on the train tracks and then put into a shed and left there, forgotten. However, these people are not forgotten by me. In this time of budgetary restraint we must not forget that there is a human factor involved. We must not forget the people who have these skills and this wisdom. Just because they are in their mid or late 40s and sometimes 50s does not mean they should be on the scrap heap. I do not accept that at all. We must always come back to the human factor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that respect, I also have a criticism of those who are in work and their concern for those who are not in work. For a number of years, former Labor minister Clyde Cameron heavily criticised the 17.5 per cent loading on annual leave. He pointed out that it was intended for shift workers who received particular allowances which were built into the nature of their work. When they went on holidays, this allowance was designed to assist them to have a reasonable annual leave. That allowance then drifted right across the economy, and I recall Clyde Cameron speaking about the fat cats who got it as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both during the election campaign and since, a number of working people have said to me that they do not really need this. I question the notion that that is a non&hyphen;negotiable, bottom line condition that could never be negotiated away in relation to what we are looking at in terms of rationalising workplace agreements and so forth. In this day and age, when people are out of work to such a degree, can we afford to have that luxury when, apart from the hardliners, most people would not really insist on having that loading? And yet now it is being built into the structure. I question that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I really wonder whether we should be starting to look at that, because it is obvious for all of us to see that there is a disparity between those who are in work and those who are not in work. Those who are not working are trudging around looking for work and those who are in work are doing very well, thanks very much. Some would say, and I would say, that in some cases they are doing too well at the expense of those who are not in work. It is easy to be critical of the trade unions' position on this, and I am sure the honourable member opposite will not accept this point of view. Once a member is out of work they generally cease to be a member of a union and as far as the union is concerned it is not terribly interested in him or her once they lose their job. I think that culture is to be deprecated, that once they are out of work the union is not particularly interested in that person.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also wanted to mention another area that concerns me about the budget, and that is the area of foreign aid. I believe that it is unfortunate that the ratio of aid to GNP has now dropped from 0.34 per cent to 0.29 per cent&mdash;the lowest percentage that we have ever contributed to foreign aid. Unfortunately, we have a populist view that has recently gained currency, where we have a member of parliament saying there should not be any foreign aid. I have had people say that to me in the course of my travels in the electorate, but I ask them, `Can you imagine your children with no basic services, lucky to have a crust of bread in their mouths every day, with no sanitation and no roof over their heads? Can you imagine that situation in your own children's case? Can you then say we should not have foreign aid?' They always come back to reality when you put that scenario to them.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4969">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, we have this populist line that we would be a lot better off as far as our country is concerned if we did not have foreign aid. With a little bit of thinking about it, you come back to reality. It can be put this way: Australians have a history of helping their neighbours. That is part of the Australian ethos&mdash;to help your neighbour. Who is your neighbour? Is it just the bloke next door or the widow down the street? Is it someone in the other suburb? Or is it the neighbourhood of the whole community, and that is the world community, not just the community beside you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To suggest that your neighbour is only that person living very handy to you is, in my view, to have a very narrow mind on this issue. I hate the use of the word `racist' because it is bandied about so easily. If a person has a different view to you then they are a racist. But when you think about it, to actually say, `Let us look after our own backyard and not worry about them,' isn't that really discriminating on the basis of race? Isn't that the purest form of discrimination on the basis of race? That means saying that our near neighbours are the ones we should look after and those others are not really our neighbours. Why? Because they are not living close, they have a different colour skin or their eyes are differently shaped to ours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we have a duty to the world community to look after those who are in dire need. The figures show that 20 per cent of people have 85 per cent of the world income and the poorest 20 per cent of those have only 1.4 per cent of the world's income. When you look at the statistics, how can a cut in the aid budget be justified? I do not cavil at the idea of trying to ensure that aid is better distributed and more wisely directed, but those who espouse that populist view of cutting out aid should question whether in the long run we are not going to be worse off. Aren't we going to be seen in the eyes of the world to be a miserable and selfish country? At the same time, by denying people the assistance that they need, we are perpetuating and entrenching more strongly the gulf between rich and poor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I emphasise in particular the wise use of aid, that is, the provision of the pump to pump out the water, or the provision of seed. The development of the infrastructure within the communities is going to help them in the end to improve their position. That is really what it is about. It is not about just throwing money at the situation, it is about providing solutions, providing education. There is a welcome increase in the aid budget for basic education and primary health care. In that respect I support the government's approach because education is one factor that is very important in ameliorating this problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the other side of the coin, the marginal decrease in funds for Africa and the decrease for south Asia is very disturbing. It is something that we cannot ignore. It is something that we have a duty to do something about. It is a duty of common humanity what we are talking about here. It does not do us any good to put it in the language that was put in the budget papers of, `Well, we really have to solve our own problems first'. That is an appeal to the most basic instincts. One could accept the cut without comment but to have a cut with that sort of self&hyphen;justification is unacceptable and I do not agree with that sort of approach. In my view, the overall cut is a very sad one in the circumstances and it is a sad comment on our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Overall, the budget is about correcting endemic debt problems at the national level, and that is to be applauded. Those hard decisions have had to be taken. In the long run one can say that Australia will be better off because of those decisions. The budget sets a path for recovery. However, there are areas of concern that we must never lose sight of and they include the human element, the unemployment element, and the aid element that I have just mentioned.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4970">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, as mentioned by the member for Banks (Mr Melham), we have to be very careful in relation to the area of Aboriginal welfare. We must ensure that money spent there is well directed money and not wasted money, but we must ensure at the same time that we assist those who are in the least advantaged position in the community.</PARA>

As a former Labor minister for Aboriginal Affairs and as one who held a portfolio for six years I want to say that I was deeply distressed and concerned by the statements made by the present Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) who, although he described the taking of Aboriginal children away from their parents as horrible, went on to say that some Aboriginal children had benefited by that experience.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was a dark period in Australian history. I have no doubt that for those who administered it they thought that what they were doing was the right thing.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What they often found was a family that was completely dysfunctional, which is not surprising given that three or four children had been taken away from their family in their early years and transported miles away from their relatives.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the time of the bells ringing, I was expressing my concern about the statements made by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. When he was appointed I said that he needed time; he needed time to get over the complexities of what is probably one of the most difficult portfolios in government. The statement that he made has led to a continued loss of confidence and loss of respect for the minister; that statement will come back to haunt him. He should modify and retract those statements because there are people living in the Aboriginal society whose lives are still, irrespective of whatever education they may have had, dysfunctional. They will never overcome the pain and the burden of those actions of separating them from their families. This was an inappropriate statement and it is a matter, I hope, that the minister will, either immediately, or in time, correct.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am concerned that, because of some of the aspects of government policy, Aboriginal leadership across Australia is increasingly losing confidence in the government. We are heading down a track where we could easily see massive confrontation, with Aboriginal people believing that there is no hope for them, and no hope for their future in this society so long as the government continues with its present policy. That is a situation which would adversely affect all of us.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4971">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other aspect that I want to touch on very quickly is some of the remarks that were made by the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) in her maiden speech. It has taken this nation, under a variety of governments, some time to get to the point where one can honestly say that there is no element of racism involved in our immigration policy. Wherever you come from&mdash;it does not matter whether you are seeking family reunion, whether you are trying to come here as a skilled person, or how you are trying to enter&mdash;the tests are exactly the same.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to take issue with the honourable member for Oxley, certainly at a very personal level, because of the quote that she made of the late honourable Arthur Calwell, the founder of our immigration policy. She took&mdash;as it was possible to take, given his time in politics&mdash;a sentence to claim some support and express some admiration for an attitude which he expressed as minister at a time when he had just come out of a war in which many Australians had died and many families were suffering as a result of the near Japanese invasion of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Calwell was well aware of the prevailing sentiment in Australia, as was the then leader of the Liberal Party, Robert Gordon Menzies. There was a generational attitude. In my own party&mdash;and I was present at the conference that overturned the white Australia policy&mdash;one could accurately predict the vote on the ages of the delegates. I do not think it was much different in the Liberal Party. And the fact is that we have come a long way since people were excluded on the basis of colour or creed. I would refer those who are interested in pursuing this matter to the very important publication by Professor Jerzy Zubrzycki, who made a study of Arthur Calwell and the origin of post&hyphen;war immigration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason I feel very deeply about this is because, if one ever had a political mentor and political father, Arthur Calwell was mine. I was a pallbearer at his funeral. Three things happened at his funeral, but I will only mention the two which are relevant to this debate. Firstly, the former Prime Minister, Robert Gordon Menzies, who had lost his ability to walk, turned up outside St Patrick's Cathedral in his car. He sat there and paid tribute to his political opponent, personal friend and colleague. As the hearse passed, Robert Gordon Menzies lifted his hat, and then he left.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing that occurred on that day&mdash;and I refer this to the honourable member for Oxley&mdash;is that the only community in Calwell's electorate of Melbourne which closed its shops and trade while the funeral was taking place was the Chinese community. That was because Arthur Calwell was not merely their representative, he was their friend. When he left the ministry and was in opposition, he chose to use his time by learning another language, and the language he chose to learn was Mandarin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He laid the basis for our immigration policy. The face of Australia we see today owes a great deal to his energy, his foresight and, indeed, the hard role he had to play. He had to deal with the issue of Japanese war brides. He had to deal with complex issues in a community where there was still, as I said, pain and suffering caused by the war.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Zubrzycki said that, on 2 August 1945, the then Leader of the Opposition, Robert Menzies, pledged his party's support, choosing to underscore Calwell's statement. Menzies said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We may have only those next 25 years in which to make the best possible use of our chance to survive. Our first requirement is additional population . . . These are grave words which I believe to be entirely true . . . My pledge to the Minister is that, if a choice has to be made between a policy of extreme caution and an adventurous policy which accepts risks because great results are involved, then let us have a more adventurous policy. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4972">  </PARA>
<PARA>I agree with Zubrzycki's comment that, in saying this, Menzies laid down a firm foundation for Australia's bipartisan policy on immigration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any person applying to come to Australia comes here on the basis of facing the same uniform test. Therefore, it is a matter of concern to me&mdash;and I think to many of my parliamentary colleagues on both sides of the House&mdash;when a newly elected member, one of our number, says that one group in the community should be excluded. She says that they should not be considered as potential citizens of Australia. Why? She makes no apology for it&mdash;it is because they are Asian.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a concept, that is a reflection upon all Australians of Chinese origin who have made a great contribution to this nation. Is she saying that if she had had a serious heart condition when Dr Chang was alive that she would not have been operated on by him because he was Asian?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Queensland recently, there was a significant art exhibition of Asian art and culture. This reflects the fact that we are part of Asia, even though we have a European culture and European heritage. However, the one thing that all ministers for immigration know&mdash;and I said this when I was working in that capacity&mdash;is that the one thing that is certain is that the last group that gets off the boat will cop the criticism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After the war, if they were Italian or Greek, there were some fairly fanciful names used to describe them. And as these people became part of our community, I had given to me, when I was minister for immigration, an article written in one of the Sydney tabloids. The heading was: `Australia being Latinised'. What had the Italians done? An enterprising reporter had actually been in that part of Sydney where Italian settlers had bought houses. But worse than that, they had actually opened restaurants and, worse again, the menus were in Italian. And Australia was being `Latinised'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard from the member for Oxley that Australia is being `Asianised'. It is palpable nonsense. It is ignorant nonsense. And words hurt. I have in my electorate a significant Jewish community, many of whom were victims of the Holocaust. No&hyphen;one could have foreseen the fact, and Adolf Hitler, whether we like it or not, was democratically elected. What did he do? All the economic problems that then faced the German people were blamed onto one group: the Jews. And what started as words of hatred which were picked up, led to Kristallnacht and to the persecution of that group and, ultimately, to the Holocaust and the destruction of those people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not saying that is what is contemplated here, but what I am saying is that there is no place in this parliament, no matter how vigorously asserted, or how ignorant the person making the statement is, where you say that you now introduce into your immigration policy a set of standards by which people are excluded on the basis of their country of origin. Australia has moved beyond that. And the kind of allegations that are made by the honourable member for Oxley have no place in this parliament. I do not argue with her right to say them, but they are palpably wrong and immoral.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was carrying out my parliamentary responsibilities at the IPU and on the way home from China I picked up, as did many other passengers on the plane, a major Hong Kong newspaper. What did I find on about page 3 or page 5&mdash;and I still have the cutting? There was a heading: `Racism growing in Australia'. And what was it referring to? It was a reference to racism and racist attitudes being shown towards Asian people. And who was quoted? The honourable <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4973"> member for Oxley was quoted. The honourable member for Oxley was featured in a paper circulating amongst the population of Hong Kong and many other parts of Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is doing the Australian people great damage because the majority of Australian people and the majority of members of this parliament do not share those views. They reject those views. And I hope that the honourable member for Oxley will give some thought to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one other matter that I feel I should raise, and I can understand the enthusiasm for the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). He is a political stayer and, as a political stayer, he fought his way through to the highest office in the land. But, equally, this view that he has that somehow his elevation to office has brought a new sense of freedom, and that political correctness&mdash;whatever that means&mdash;is no longer the order of the day, and that political correctness means that you have to support what are the prevailing views in this society, is wrong. I do not believe that this position was ever part of the Hawke or the Keating governments. And as one who has been in politics some time, I am bound to say that most of that time I would have been regarded by the governments of the day as being politically incorrect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I started at an early age of 18 stuffing letterboxes in Richmond and Hawthorn in the anti&hyphen;communist referendum. If you did that, you were regarded as a communist at worst, and as a pro&hyphen;communist at best&mdash;a politically incorrect position. I was involved in the first of the nuclear protests and that was a very politically incorrect position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am bound to say that at the recent protest at Mururoa I was joined by a number of my parliamentary colleagues from the Liberal Party, and I was pleased to see that their presence has now made me politically correct. Equally, I found myself in the situation where I was opposed to the conscription of Australian youth for the war in Vietnam, and that also led to strong allegations that one was disloyal, one was not prepared to stand up to fight the threat of communism. I remember seeing pamphlets in my community saying: better stop them there than have them come here, with a big red arrow not coming out of Vietnam but actually coming out of China. That was a politically incorrect position. It was a minority position in the beginning and ultimately, of course, we were proved right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was the same with apartheid. I remember seeing my fellow citizens being brutally bashed in a legitimate and proper democratic protest on the occasion of the South African rugby tour game taking place in Melbourne. That was then a totally politically incorrect position, but not any more. History has caught up with us and our views have been proved right, and the evidence now being given in South Africa shows just how right it was.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So this view of political correctness depends upon how you see it. The fact is that in our political life the culture in this parliament has changed. After the Vietnam War I was a lone voice speaking on behalf of Vietnam veterans who had been exposed to herbicides. For three years I was pretty much a lone voice because the government did not want to know about it. Experiments that have taken place in America over the last five to 10 years have proved that those concerns are right and that there is a clear correlation between some of the conditions of the children of Vietnam veterans and Vietnam veterans themselves and their exposure to defoliants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What might be seen as a politically correct position today is not necessarily a politically correct position tomorrow, and this view that somehow in this new spirit of tolerance you can say anything you like, you can characterise people on the basis of their colour or their creed, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4974"> is totally unacceptable. It is even more unacceptable in this parliament. There is an old saying: if it walks like a duck, it quacks like a duck and it looks like a duck, it is probably a duck.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those people who want to engage in this kind of political nonsense, I believe they have no real contribution to make to this parliament. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(9.48 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like many on the coalition side, I am a person who is very pleased to be in government after 13 years, but also equally pleased to be associated with this budget, the first Howard&hyphen;Costello budget of the coalition. I know a lot of commentators have said that the budget is strong but fair, and as I go around my electorate and other electorates this has been echoed by the people that I have spoken to. Over the last 13 years they have faced the Labor Party and also faced the neglect of the former government for Australian families who they have purported to represent, who seem, particularly the middle income group, to be going further and further down, getting further and further behind. But at last they have seen some hope in this government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Farmers have also been affected over the last 13 years. Certainly, they had to face droughts and low commodity prices, but the actions of the previous government did not help them. And to small business, who are really the backbone of the economy, it seemed that every time they turned around there was some more tax and more red tape. As I went around the electorate before the last election, and the one before that, small business people were saying, `We are getting older and older, we are working harder when we should be starting to take it easy, and we have a business here which is really our superannuation but no&hyphen;one in their right mind would want to buy.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They were really feeling the brunt of the policies of the previous government. So they were delighted when the coalition was elected and more delighted when they saw the policies put forward by the government. But they are starting to get a bit edgy now because we are having some problems getting those measures through the Senate, even though we have a very large majority in the House of Representatives and, I believe, a mandate from the people to have that legislation passed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like so many people in the community, I am both angry and disappointed that the Labor government's legacy to this great nation has been a mountain of debt in excess of over $100 billion. It seems to me that Labor governments have this reputation of being large taxers and large spenders, and you need the tax if you are going to spend. I notice the paper put out by one of the senators which says that income in taxes and charges in 1992&hyphen;93 was $95 billion and it had increased to $124 billion in 1995&hyphen;96. That is a rise of 30.9 per cent&mdash;and all that money has been spent. If we move to loans, it was $32 billion as at 30 June 1991, it rose to $100 billion at 30 June 1996&mdash;and that is all gone. Assets sales over four years&mdash;Qantas, the Commonwealth Bank et cetera&mdash;totalled $8.68 billion. All that is gone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The worst part of it was that infrastructure investment in the mid&hyphen;1980s was eight per cent of outlays, was down to 4.7 per cent when Mr Keating was appointed Prime Minister and this year&mdash;1995&hyphen;96&mdash;is down to minus 0.3 per cent. That is a tragedy for our nation and is really something we have to act on very quickly. Of course, it was not only the Federal government that had a problem. We saw what happened in Victoria, Western Australia and South Australia and it is starting to happen in Queensland. As I said before, it just seems that when you have Labor governments they like to spend big so they have to tax in a large way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The interest on the debt in the 1996&hyphen;97 budget will cost more than is allocated to defence, education and industry assistance. I am also fairly upset that the coalition has had to start its <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4975"> first term trying to claw its way up from the bottom of a deep financial hole dug by the mismanagement of successive Hawke&hyphen;Keating governments. Faced with a budget deficit of $10.3 billion in 1995&hyphen;96, the government has had to embark on a firm fiscal strategy to eliminate the budget deficit in order to secure the financial future of the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition has been forced to make some tough and difficult decisions with the goodwill, understanding and cooperation of the Australian people. I must say that, despite the coalition having to take some strong actions, the Australian people&mdash;certainly the ones I have spoken to&mdash;on both sides of the political fence have said, `It is about time governments were honest with us and told us where we stood. We don't mind bearing the burden as long as we are going to get somewhere at the end of it.' That is the attitude that I have seen in many people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The majority of people have accepted that it was imperative for the new government to take stern fiscal action. The majority of people accept that everyone has been asked to shoulder the burden. They accept the pain, knowing the government's budget strategy to reduce debt will secure a better future for all Australians and for future generations. Some of the people who have come into my office have complained about the problem they are going to face, the cutbacks in their area. I have asked them to consider the situation and said to them, `Do you want to bear some of the short term pain now for the future as an Australian, or do you want to be an Australian who just doesn't care about the future, doesn't care about obtaining work for your children and your grandchildren, the quality of life and the standard of living?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While most people I have spoken to have not been happy about it, they have agreed that that is the way we ought to be going. All they ask of their government is honesty and they want fair play. They do not want to have one section of the community bear all the load. They want it to be spread right throughout the community. Our government would have been quite irresponsible if it had failed to take firm but fair action to turn around the Australian economy after a decade of economic vandalism. That is what it was that put us in that situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Failure to take this tough, unpopular fiscal decision at the correct time would have condemned the Australian people to a continuing period of rising deficit and debt into the next century&mdash;this has been said many times before, but we should keep repeating it; we have to do something and that is why we have to get our legislation through the Senate&mdash;it would have exposed them and their families to a bleak future, and applied pressure to interest rates and to jobs growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the economic mess inherited from the Hawke&hyphen;Keating administration, the Howard government has been able to deliver in full on its key election promises. First of all, it has delivered to families, and families are the cornerstone of our great nation&mdash;we know that. We really had to do something for families, which seemed to be falling further and further behind. I do not know, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;and I know that you would have been aware of this as you went around your electorate&mdash;how some of those families survived. People who were earning what once was a really good wage, say, between $30,000 and $40,000 per year, with a few children, were finding that they were slipping back further and further. They were wondering what in the heck was going on and what was causing this. The Howard government has looked into this situation and is trying desperately to help these families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our young people who are unemployed are being trained and retrained and retrained&mdash;for what? There is no real training and no real jobs. The Howard government is trying to do something about this.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4976">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have mentioned small business. They just thought that they would have to keep on working until they were carried out in a pine box. There was no way they could retire because no&hyphen;one wanted their business and that is their superannuation. And, of course, there are the elderly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know the Labor Party finds it painful to come to grips with the fact that the first Howard government budget has been a winner, as evidenced by the strong support of the Australian people and the majority of media commentators and economists. The Labor Party's pathetic attempt to attack certain sections of the budget and to resort to a campaign of scaremongering clearly illustrates just how out of touch the Labor Party continues to be with the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the key promises of the Howard government was the $1 billion family tax initiative, which is being delivered in full, restoring hope and reducing the tax burden on families with children. We have kept faith with the Australian community by keeping our promise to look after the poor and needy by maintaining and enhancing the social security safety net. The people who benefit most are those lower and middle income families with children, a group which, as I said before, was neglected by the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Single income families with several young children will benefit between $40 and $50 extra each fortnight. This will certainly relieve some of the economic pressure. There will be assistance through the taxation system, while low income families will be able to claim the family tax payment through the social security system, paid fortnightly with their family payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that members on the opposite side of the House would be concerned about what is happening to families in Australia. We have had inquiries into the Child Support Agency and family law. Much needs to be done there; I have spent a great deal of time in my office and I would say the major issues would be the Child Support Agency and family law. This is one of the problems we face in Australia and, I suppose, why our budgets blow out: family breakdown. We have to look seriously&mdash;both the government and the opposition&mdash;at this problem and see where we are going with it because I do not think we can sustain it too far into the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Small business, which is at the heart of rural and regional Australia, has been given a much needed economic boost in this budget. Small business, as I said before, suffered enormous economic setbacks under Labor policies, which produced record business closures and bankruptcies. I mention the rural sector because if you go to many towns&mdash;not even outback towns but regional towns&mdash;you will find the shops boarded up and closed. There are many reasons for that and we cannot blame just the economy. It is modern transport and certainly there has been tremendous pressure on those businesses in rural and regional areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget has restored incentives for small business; incentives aimed at creating an economic environment in which that important sector can confidently expand and create real jobs and get Australians back to work and be part of an exciting and innovative government program to revamp the nation's traineeship and apprenticeship schemes, which will offer significant working opportunities for young school leavers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have found that a number of towns in my electorate are held up because of the lack of tradesmen in the area. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</PARA>
