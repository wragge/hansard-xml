<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr MILES</EMPHASIS> (Braddon&mdash;Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (9.31 a.m.)&mdash;I move:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill amends the Development Allowance Authority Act 1992&mdash;the principal act. The primary purpose of the bill is to amend the principal act to remove certain restrictions on the restructuring of ownership of projects eligible for the development allowance so that a more consistent approach is available to the various types of prospective applicants for the development allowance. Where all other criteria in the principal act are met, these amendments would allow the transfer of the development allowance benefit where ownership of a project is transferred to another entity after application for the development allowance but before registration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Further, the amendments would allow the transfer of the development allowance benefit where ownership of a project is transferred from one entity structure to another type of entity structure after application for the development allowance. To maximise the effectiveness of the amendments, they will be retrospective and will apply from 1 January 1993, which is the date applications for the development allowance close. The amendments will also provide that any applications for registration of plant expenditure that were refused, or granted in respect of an amount of expenditure that was less than the amount of expenditure whose registration was sought in the application, may be granted in full if they would have been granted in full if the amend ments proposed in the bill had been in force when the principal act received royal assent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moreover, the amendments will provide that any application for registration of plant expenditure that was withdrawn may be taken not to have been withdrawn if an application for transfer of the benefits of the application for registration could have been made if the amendments proposed in this bill had been in force when the principal act received royal assent. The amendments will also grant the Development Allowance Authority a power to determine that an application by an entity for registration of plant expenditure has lapsed in certain limited circumstances. The opportunity is also taken to make some minor administrative adjustments and to correct certain apparent drafting errors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill has no budgetary implications, as the revenue implications of the proposed amendments were previously incorporated into the budget estimates. The benefits of the amendments, in terms of revenue forgone, to projects which qualify for the allowance under the provisions of the bill is expected to be approximately $10 million per annum. Over the nine years from 1993-94 to 2001&hyphen;02, the benefit to projects is expected to be approximately $92 million. This benefit relates only to unregistered projects that have already restructured or have developed an intention to restructure before registration. There is no reliable estimate of the prospective benefit to projects of allowing all types of restructuring after registration, but the benefit is unlikely to be more than $3 million per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The explanatory memorandum takes account of amendments made by the Australian Democrats in the Senate to the bill as introduced. Those amendments exclude urban roads from eligibility for the infrastructure borrowings concession. The government does not accept the Democrat amendments made in the Senate. Those amendments were made in haste and were not well considered. This bill deals with the development allowance. The amendments moved in the Senate relate to an entirely different issue&mdash;infrastructure borrowings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The provisions of this bill will provide access to the development allowance to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> approximately 40 projects involving investment of some $2.5 billion over the next six years. These projects include 18 in the mining industry; 10 in the tourism industry; six in electricity, gas and water; four in manufacturing; and three in transport and storage. The mining projects are primarily in Queensland, New South Wales and Western Australia. Many of these projects will have been proceeding with their investment plans on the basis of the bipartisan support this bill received in the parliament last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With one ill&hyphen;considered act, the Senate has jeopardised not only the investment and employment opportunities for Australians but also the goodwill of the business community for the Australian parliament. In relation to infrastructure borrowings, the Senate amendments misunderstand the role of infrastructure borrowings in the development of infrastructure projects. Infrastructure borrowings serve only to remove a potential tax impediment to one possible financing option available to infrastructure developers. The decisions as to whether infrastructure projects proceed at all is largely a decision for other levels of government. The government will therefore be moving to have these amendments removed from this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Accordingly, the supplementary explanatory memorandum explains new clauses and amendments to be moved on behalf of the government to remove the amendments made by the Senate. This will restore the bill back to its form as originally introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I present the explanatory memorandum and the supplementary explanatory memorandum which contains more detailed explanations of the provisions of the bill. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></PROCTEXT>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This error&hyphen;prone government, this clumsy government, is at it again&mdash;this time with a Costello cock&hyphen;up. The Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill demonstrates the terrible sense of political judgment and timing of the Treasurer (Mr Costello). It again demonstrates this government's abuse of parliamentary process and the authority of the executive. </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2960">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On Monday, at a time when the Senate was due to debate amendments to the development allowance, the Treasurer announced in question time his own policy statement on the development allowance: the continuation of tax concessions for urban tollways. If he had waited just 24 hours&mdash;one day&mdash;this bill would have passed through each House unamended. If anyone is to blame as to the suggestion of a delay in these development projects, then the Treasurer should have a good look in the mirror, as should the member for Braddon, the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have noticed the feigned outrage the government have demonstrated about this provision. If they are so upset and so outraged, where is the Treasurer this morning? Why has he sent a parliamentary secretary, who has no responsibility whatsoever for the development allowance or tax concessions, into the chamber for carriage of this legislation? If this government are so upset and so concerned about this piece of legislation, they should have the responsible minister in the chamber. It is a mark of their disrespect for this House of Representatives that the Commonwealth Treasurer is not here this morning. It is a mark of their abuse of parliamentary process that he was willing to make major policy statements in the House of Representatives while at the same time, in another place, this type of legislation was before the Senate chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the same type of mistiming and misjudgment which wrecked the Premiers Conference. It is the same type of arrogance and conceited behaviour which wrecked the first Premiers Conference under the Howard&hyphen;Fischer government. The Treasurer is demonstrating himself to be a poor politician and a poor parliamentarian&mdash;and we all know he is a poor economist&mdash;because he has made these mistimed and misjudged exercises into legislation. Whenever he makes a mistimed announcement, he always finds someone else to blame: the premiers, the Democrats, the Labor Party or the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He should have a good look in the mirror and understand that on this matter the only reason the government has a difficulty and a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> problem is that the Treasurer mistimed his announcement. If he had waited 24 hours&mdash;just one day&mdash;without trying to abuse parliamentary process and standards, then certainly this legislation would have passed through both chambers absolutely unamended. He is always trying to find someone else to blame and on this matter I would suggest his only defence is the Downer defence&mdash;because he is foolish, he is innocent. That is what the Treasurer is trying to say on this matter, using the Downer defence. Because he is foolish, because he has made the mistimed announcement, he is innocent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth is that if any of those companies waiting for their development allowance and any of those restructured corporate bodies that are relying on this legislation want to point the bone and seek out blame, they should look no further than the Treasurer's office. They should look no further than the ham&hyphen;fisted, clumsy Treasurer who was in here on Monday, so smug and so clever, trying to make an announcement about tax concessions for urban roads while at the same time the Senate was considering&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="MILES" NAMEID="BI4">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BI4">Mr Miles</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Why don't you debate the issues? Just personal attacks.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="K26">Mr LATHAM</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was the Treasurer who made a personal attack on Labor Party and Democrat members about this matter in question time yesterday. But he will not be in the House this morning. He sends in a parliamentary secretary who has no responsibility whatsoever for the development allowance. So much for this being an important matter. So much for this being an issue of economic significance in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask the simple question: why should the parliament tolerate a foolish Treasurer? Why should we tolerate someone who makes such an error of judgment? Why should we tolerate someone who so mistimes his announcements as to place in jeopardy these major development projects in Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2961"> The Labor Party is in a very happy position on this legislation because all the other parties and other interests are absolutely rushing to promote and legislate on our policy. First of all it was the Liberal Party reintroducing the Development Allowance Authority Amend ment Bill&mdash;this legislation that the former government introduced in September 1995. We are happy to support them on those provisions. They are rushing to legislate on the policy of the Australian Labor Party on the development allowance so we are happy to support the Liberal Party on those particular provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we had the Democrats following the Treasurer's foolish, clumsy and mistimed announcement about urban tollways. We had the Democrats move in the Senate to terminate the tax concessions on those urban tollways. They are announcing Labor Party policy from December 1995&mdash;announced by the members for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith (Mr Brereton) and Gellibrand (Mr Willis). We are happy to support the Democrats on their rush to introduce Labor Party policy into both houses of the Commonwealth parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We thank the Liberal Party for moving our legislation on the development allowance. We thank the Democrats for moving our policy on tax concessions on urban tollways. It just goes to demonstrate that it is always the Labor Party painting the masterpieces of Australian public policy. We leave it to the Liberals and Democrats to run off the prints and the imitations, and to introduce this kind of legislation in both houses of the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also defend the right of the Democrats to introduce this type of amendment. The Labor Party will be supporting their provisions in the House of Representatives; we will be attempting to vote down the government amendments that the parliamentary secretary has suggested to the House. This is what the parliament is all about. It is about legislative amendment: new ideas, new information, new policies being placed in the public arena. If the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) were half serious about his proposition that the parliament is supreme over the executive, then he too would support the Democrat amendment because, in light of the Treasurer's ill&hyphen;timed, clumsy announcement, it is totally legitimate for the Senate to respond in kind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take the memory of those members opposite back to last year when the then government was trying to introduce airport privatisation legislation through both houses <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the parliament&mdash;something to do with finance and development prospects in Australian airports. How did the Liberal Party, including the members for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) and Braddon, then respond? They responded by tacking onto that airport privatisation legislation a provision about Sydney airport and reopening the east&hyphen;west runway. They tacked on a provision that was not to do with the private leasing; it was to do with operational efficiency and safety of that airport. They have a record on this; they have a track record and form on this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They too, in opposition, were in the business of taking one piece of legislation and moving a related amendment in the other place. They held up that legislation and it was not passed at the dissolution of the last parliament. By the standards that the Prime Minister set, when he was in opposition, it is totally legitimate for the Democrats to respond to the Treasurer's announcement in this place and to move their amendment on the development allowance bill in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is very important for the House to understand this fundamental truth. The only way government policy on the tax concessions and the only way government policy on the urban tollways will change is if they change it. They are the policy makers and they have the whip hand on this particular matter. The Treasurer, in a press release issued on 24 June, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the legislation to enact the decision of 15 December has not been introduced to parliament, the effect of today's announcement is that urban road projects have never been excluded from the infrastructure borrowings concession.</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the legislation had not been introduced; the previous government was not able to legislate on its announcement. So the Treasurer has pointed out that these tax concessions on the urban tollways have never been taken away. The only way they can be removed is if the government supports those provisions in the House today and confirms the Democrat amendment that was moved in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is up to the government to decide whether or not it is willing to change its policy on tax concessions for urban toll roads. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2962"> The former government had not legislated on those provisions. If they want the development projects to proceed&mdash;the development projects which rely on these amendments to the development allowance&mdash;then they should support this bill and those provisions, as the Senate supported them. There is no legitimacy in the claim that development projects are being held up by the Senate amendment, because the Senate passed the changes to the development allowance. It is available to government members today to support those changes to the development allowance and give the green light to those development projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note the hypocrisy of Senator Short aka Mr Williams in the other place. It is always interesting to note his hypocrisy on these matters, saying that it is the Labor Party and the Democrats who are holding up $2.5 billion worth of development projects because we are not allowing the easy passage of the development allowance. We are allowing the easy passage of the development allowance. But it is interesting to note that this is the same Senator Short who, back in June 1992, did not even support the development allowance. If Senator Short aka Mr Williams had had his way back in June 1992, these projects would not have even been considered; they would not have been on the drawing board of corporate Australia. Senator Short said in the other place on 17 June 1992:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will very quickly outline again why we are opposed to the Development Allowance Authority Bill and the Pooled Development Funds Bill. The Development Allowance Authority Bill establishes a one&hyphen;member statutory authority&mdash;the Development Allowance Authority, the DAA&mdash;which will have the task of assessing the eligibility of large projects with the capital cost of $50m or more. The basic objection that we have to this is that no earthly reason has been presented as to why we have to set up yet another quango to handle a matter such as this.</PARA>
<PARA>So the double standards are stark; the hypocrisy is stunning. There is no reason for the senator to complain because he did not even support the development allowance. It was his policy, in 1992, to oppose the development allowance in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. The government has been caught out on these matters. We are glad that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> there has been a late conversion to Labor Party policy to reintroduce the legislation that we had before the House in September 1995, but we note the hypocrisy as they do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, I would suggest that the government and Senator Short are gilding the lily on these matters. They are suggesting that $2.5 million worth of development is being held up. They also state in the provisions of this bill that it provides an additional $10 million per annum in the development allowance. This is an extraordinary multiplier effect. The idea that there is $2.5 billion worth of investment being held up by just $10 million worth of tax concessions is a bit rich.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="CADMAN" NAMEID="SD4">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SD4">Mr Cadman</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Sounds like the piggery.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="K26">Mr LATHAM</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would have thought it is a bit rich and a bit unrealistic. The member for Mitchell is not known for his prowess in economics, but even he would understand that it is a bit rich to say that $10 million worth of tax concessions multiplies into $2.5 billion worth of investment. That is a multiplier effect, according to Senator Short aka Mr Williams, of 250 times. Talk about feeding the multitudes. Talk about turning loaves and fishes into a feast. This is a ridiculous proposition. There is no way in the world that $2.5 billion worth of investment would be hanging off a tax concession of no more than $10 million of public money. There is no way in the world that you would get that sort of multiplier effect in the corporate balance sheets of the Australian nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there is a bit of gilding the lily, a bit of exaggeration, a fair bit of hypocrisy and a lot of double standards from Senator Short. I would have thought that, on this matter, the protests he is making today by way of press release are well and truly discredited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let the House be assured that the Labor Party supports the amendments to the Development Allowance Authority Bill. Why wouldn't we support them? We introduced them to the House in September 1995. We also support the abolition of tax concessions for urban tollways. Why wouldn't we support the abolition of those concessions? The former Treasurer, Ralph Willis, and the former Minister for Transport, the honourable member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith (Mr Brereton), <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2963"> made the announcement in December last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we are in the very happy position today where everyone else is rushing to introduce our policy and we are sitting back happy to endorse their actions, happy to endorse their policy decisions and happy to vote on those particular provisions. We are in a very luxurious position. Everyone is rushing to introduce Labor Party policy. They are falling over themselves&mdash;the government on the development allowance, the Democrats on the tax concessions for urban tollways.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we do object very strongly to the continuation of government tax concessions for urban tollways. There are three reasons for that objection: it is immoral, it is bad public policy and it does not satisfy the public interest. I know members such as the member for Braddon and the member for Mitchell have a pretty big interest in morality. They preach morality. They send little letters out about breakfast and so forth. So they are interested in morality. How can they defend the idea&mdash;</PARA>

You are introducing $8 billion worth of cuts on the one hand but you can afford tax concessions for the big end of town on the other. Where is the morality in that? Where is the fairness in that proposition? If the budget position is so unsound, how can you afford tax concessions for big financial institutions and big construction companies that want to build urban tollways? How can you afford those concessions if, as you argue, the budget position is so unsound?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They can cut employment programs, public housing and rent assistance, which hurts those in the community who can least provide for themselves, but, when the members for Mitchell and Braddon are writing out cheques for the big end of town, there are tax concessions for big financial institutions and construction companies which want to build urban tollways. That is a shameful double standard. That is a shameful piece of immorality. It is completely immoral for the government to make $8 billion worth of cuts for middle Australia and give more tax concessions to the big end of town so that they can build more tollways.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2964">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It demonstrates the point that I have made frequently in this House: the Liberal Party does not mind rent seekers and special pleaders, just as long as they are from the big end of town, as long as they are the big financial interests in Australia. That is why they are backing the tax concessions for the financial institutions which want to build those tollways around urban Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that respect, and with the budget bottom line, I have to say that the Labor Party is here to help on this matter of fiscal consolidation. We are from the opposition and we are here to help. We are willing to abolish the tax concessions at a significant fiscal saving to the government. We are here on this provision to help the government's fiscal consolidation program. How more magnanimous can I possibly be than to say that we are from the opposition and, on this issue of fiscal consolidation, we are here to help.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought that the member for Mitchell, the member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Nairn) and the member for Braddon would have put out their hands to accept this help. I thought that they would have seen me as the good Samaritan in this matter of fiscal consolidation. We are here to abolish tax concessions at a fiscal saving to the government, at a saving to the budget bottom line. We are from the opposition, and we are here to help.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make the further point that these tax concessions for urban tollways are bad public policy. I am not the only person saying that. It has been revealed in various reports to various governments.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What about EPAC?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="K26">Mr LATHAM</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Burke astutely, and correctly, points out that EPAC last year in its September 1995 report on private infrastructure made these points:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Governments should not presume that either the private or the public sector can deliver projects more efficiently. For each project they should assess whether public ownership with contracting out, a BOOT&hyphen;type arrangement or full privatisation best meets the community's needs.</PARA>
<PARA>It continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . experience in other countries points to the difficulties of regulating private monopolies. In particular, it has sometimes proved difficult to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> prevent abusive market power without weakening the incentives for efficient service provision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the broad, BOOT&hyphen;type structures are likely to be least beneficial for road and urban rail projects.</PARA>
<PARA>It is worth repeating that for the benefit of government members opposite. It continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They are more advantageous for long distance rail and for utility services such as electricity and water.</PARA>
<PARA>The Labor Party endorses that proposition. The opposition embraces the proposition that BOOT private infrastructure, funded by these types of tax concessions, is least beneficial for road and urban rail projects. We are willing to support the continuation of the tax concessions, as per the EPAC report, for long distance rail and utility services, such as electricity and water. The EPAC report went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Contrary to a popular view, infrastructure as a whole is not significantly tax disadvantaged compared to most other investments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is therefore no strong `tax inefficiency' case for retaining infrastructure bonds, which indirectly provide a tax benefit to some private projects . . . the development of the capital markets largely removes the ongoing need for such a concession. Accordingly, the Task Force does not see a compelling case for retaining infrastructure bonds in the longer term.</PARA>
<PARA>That is very significant. EPAC was saying that if you get the depth into the capital markets in Australia, you do not need these tax concessions to fund the infrastructure bonds. I can only assume that the Treasurer, if he wants to continue with these tax concessions, has little faith in his own capacity to get the depth into the capital markets. The Treasurer really is holding up the white flag of surrender on his own aspirations for national savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">EPAC has made the very astute point that if you have depth in the capital markets and higher national savings in Australia you do not need these types of tax concessions. So the Treasurer has surrendered on his own ability to produce that depth, to produce that increase in national savings. That is a very significant point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Treasurer has been caught out again with another stunning double standard, another stunning piece of hypocrisy. On the one <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2965"> hand he is saying that he is going to repair national savings in Australia, that he is going to get depth into the capital markets, but on the other hand, contrary to the EPAC report, he is saying that he needs to have tax concessions to get urban infrastructure up and running.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not only EPAC reporting to the former government on these particular matters. Just last Friday there was the release from the National Commission of Audit. I would have thought that the member for Eden-Monaro and the member for Braddon could not possibly question the findings of the National Commission of Audit. On these matters, the commission said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not apparent, within the current income tax arrangements, why special tax treatment should apply to infrastructure borrowings.</PARA>
<PARA>That is worth repeating. It continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CSO elements should be separately identified and directly funded. The Commission considers the current arrangements should be reviewed.</PARA>
<PARA>In its report of last Friday, it went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of all these factors, tax concessions are a largely non&hyphen;transparent form of assistance. This lack of transparency makes less visible the effect of tax concessions on the budget and reduces accountability. It also increases the likelihood that poorly targeted concessions will remain on offer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This lack of transparency is also inconsistent with the Charter of Budget Honesty's objectives to ensure greater transparency for the decisions and operations of government.</PARA>
<PARA>There it is in black and white from the National Commission of Audit: a report&mdash;commissioned by the Treasurer&mdash;released just last Friday condemning this provision that the government supports; condemning the government's determination to continue with these tax concessions. The Commission of Audit correctly points out that they are not transparent, that they reduce accountability and that they reduce the government's capacity to live with its Charter of Budget Honesty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, even by the words of the National Commission of Audit, the government has been exposed as inadequate. These tax concessions are not transparent, they are not accountable and they are not consistent with the government's own Charter of Budget Honesty. I again urge the government to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reconsider the way in which it is supporting these propositions by the parliamentary secretary, and the way in which it is opposing the Democrat amendments made in the other place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) has described the Commission of Audit report as a `road map'. What I say is that it should be a road map without tax concessions for tollways. He knows those things because he has been a Premier of New South Wales, and he was part of the bad public policy that led to the M5 tollway in the south&hyphen;west of Sydney, the M4 tollway in Western Sydney and the impending construction of the M2 tollway in north&hyphen;west Sydney. These things, of course, demonstrate that the construction of those tollways&mdash;through the eyes of state government&mdash;is nothing more than a cost shifting exercise. It is a cost shifting exercise whereby governments would like to build these roads but, for short&hyphen;term budgetary reasons, they seek to push the cost of them onto user&hyphen;payers&mdash;the people who can pay the toll.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Paying the toll, of course, hurts low&hyphen;income earners who cannot afford that regressive road tax. It hurts small business&mdash;the sort of small business the government says it supports. There are all those courier operations up and down the tollways, paying the regressive road tax. Their business aspirations and profitability are severely damaged by these types of roads and the type of cost shifting exercise that state governments have engaged in. Beyond that, these tollways represent secret deals. That is why they are bad public policy. There is no accountability and no transparency. So much for a Charter of Budget Honesty when we never get to see the funny money deals that are made by way of secret contract on these tollways. The contracts are kept secret&mdash;they are hidden behind an argument of commercial confidence. The tax arrangements between the Taxation Office and each of the tollway companies are also kept secret&mdash;they are also hidden behind confidentiality reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there is no transparency. There is no accountability to the public. These are secret funny money deals that the government is trying to promote through the maintenance of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2966"> these tax concessions. As the deals are negotiated it is no secret that the tollway companies hold all the aces. The public sector is not suited to this type of negotiation. The companies always know more about the finance risk than government negotiators do. They always know more about the rate of return than government negotiators do. As governments become desperate to shift their costs to private users of the road&mdash;off to user&hyphen;pays arrangements&mdash;the negotiations favour the companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Due to the financial mismanagement of the Greiner and Fahey governments in New South Wales, we have ended up by handing over to private tollway companies a licence to print money. You handed over a licence to print money to those tollway companies. These tax concessions end up&mdash;this is recognised by EPAC and the National Commission of Audit&mdash;as nothing more than an unnecessary subsidisation of private profit. These tax concessions prop up arrangements arrived at by state government where they hand over a licence to print money. Those companies running the M4 and the M5 in Sydney&mdash;and soon the City Link project in Melbourne and the M2 in the north&hyphen;west of Sydney, through the electorate of Mitchell&mdash;have a licence to print money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The payment of these tax concessions is obscene. The payment of these tax concessions is immoral. It is a substantial amount of money because, for every billion dollars worth of infrastructure, the tax concession is $50 million. As we talk now about the eastern distributor project in Sydney and the extension of the M5 east towards Tempe, we are talking about the possibility of federal subsidies, in the form of tax concessions, of $75 million: $75 million paid in federal subsidies to companies which already have a licence to print money. That is obscene and immoral.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Beyond that, these urban tollway projects represent bad urban planning because they rely on the funnelling of traffic onto the tollway: funnel the traffic onto the tollway, collect the tolls and continue that licence to print money by the private tollway operators. Those citizens who cannot afford the toll end up using all the side streets and all the urban <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> shortcuts&mdash;the planners call it the `rat run'&mdash;as they seek to avoid the toll and the main road. That, of course, has an unhappy consequence for all those residents who want to live in a quiet residential area, but who have a stream of traffic running through their streets trying to avoid the toll.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are other problems. There are no exit ramps; people are trapped on the road and have to pay their toll. Of course, the standard of living problem is severe. It is a triple whammy caused by these tax concessions. People pay their own taxes, which should fund the construction of public roads; they are funding the $75 million tax concession that the government is trying to push through the parliament; and they then have to pay a toll. So it is a triple whammy on standards of living. These projects are to be denounced as immoral and improper. They are bad public policy, they are bad urban planning, and there is no way in the world the Labor Party will be supporting the continuation of these tax concessions. We will be insisting on their removal here in the House and then in the Senate.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> (Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to follow the previous speaker, the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), because he gave a perfect illustration of the reasons why the Labor Party are no longer in office. They can believe anything and say anything as long as they can try to hoodwink the public into following what they state.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have here&mdash;and I will not read them today&mdash;folders containing Labor's lies at the 1996 election. They are classified by portfolio. These are the hoodwinking processes the Labor Party wanted to dump on the Australian people that would create further unemployment, more bankruptcies and a greater debt. The spokesman for the Australian Labor Party today has been saying that the Labor Party's system of doing things was going to offer the only prospect for Australia's economic salvation. The fact is that the Labor Party could not generate enough interest in capital investment in Australia during their term in office to encourage anybody to want to do anything. The problem with the whole nation was it went so <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2967"> flat that people lost confidence and lost confidence in the government as well. So there were no funds available for any infrastructure work, no funds for private enterprise development and no funds for jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The members opposite seem to have forgotten those facts within the last 14 weeks. There has been a change in Australia, one that people want to bring about. They are sick of having one million people unemployed. They are sick of a bankruptcy level where around 12,000 or 14,000 companies go bust a year. They are sick of Australia having a record foreign debt despite all the give-aways, the so&hyphen;claimed tax reforms, the glass flowing over and the bacon coming home&mdash;the extraordinary statements made by the previous Prime Minister of how Australia had recovered. The Australian people rejected those claims. Again, today those claims have been revisited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party is imposing its own moral judgment on what is right and wrong for the Australian people&mdash;a selective, narrow, Canberra based morality for the rest of the nation. It just does not work that way. It is a typical narrow, right wing ALP view of the nation. That is a great shame. There is, within the Australian Labor Party, the capacity for ideas to come forward about productive things that will advance the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind the members of the Australian Labor Party of the high degree of cynicism they created in this nation. That cynicism was created by the morality that exists within the Australian Labor Party. What they have said and done is, `We hold ourselves separate from the community and separate from local government and the states. Here in Canberra we maintain that we have a right to say that yes we will give tax concessions to large companies if they want to build ports, bridges or other things but not if they want to build roadways.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So they say the Development Allowance Authority can administer funds for runways, taxiways, aprons, air transport, tunnels, bridges and railways. It can administer funds for all sorts of things but not for urban tollways. You are going to make an adjustment to your previous policy to oppose some of the policies contained in this legislation that the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> House is debating today&mdash;that is, the Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe that subsidising tax is beneficial in the long run for the processes of the nation. I would have thought that encouraging savings and developing capital infrastructure would have been a much better way to give people an option to make investments and support government infrastructure than any other. I have said so since 1993 yet the honourable member opposite, who proclaims himself as something of an expert in these areas, slavishly supported the Labor Party's ideas of tax concessions for large infrastructure companies building things that the Labor Party wanted built.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sudden change of heart and the moderation that the election has brought about is not a rethink on the part of the Australian Labor Party but a recommitment to a more selective application of their original ideas. That is not going to solve the problems. The government's ultimate commitment, as the Treasurer (Mr Costello) has said on many occasions, is to establish a regime to encourage savings in Australia. It is only by building the depth of available capital that markets, individuals and governments as well&mdash;I notice the member is nodding&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This measure that the government is proposing today is a necessary process for the continuation of the projects.

The previous Deputy Prime Minister Brian Howe said that we <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2968"> ought to go into an infrastructure binge. That was a taxpayer funded binge that nobody took seriously but he thought he would encourage others to do it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have never told anybody what your policies are. The economic prowess of the Australian Labor Party has been demonstrated over 13 years. But following an election you think you have the opportunity to come in here say in relation to the announced policies that the people decided on 14 weeks ago, `We have a right to block anything, whether announced or not announced.'

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Now here is a change of thinking. The honourable member for Burke is saying that the Australian Labor Party believes it is their right to block anything and everything, despite the wishes of the Australian people. It does not matter how recently these matters have been decided in the election process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Are you suggesting that, in future, Australian governments must have a referendum and joint sittings of both houses in order to obtain the will of the people? Do you mean to say that the bottom line, the common denominator <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in this place, is the obstructionism that the Australian Labor Party and the Democrats have shown in the Senate? Is that the way this country is going to operate: you ignore the people and their wishes expressed in an election?  It seems to me that that is what you are saying. In fact, it is what you have said and that is the way you are behaving.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In regard to the Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill, you are saying, `We will be selective in the way in which we will let things through.' I happen to believe that Sydney and Melbourne do need roadways. There is no way in which public transport can provide answers for those cities. Those cities are car based, they are vehicular traffic based, and there is no way you are going to change that. There have been attempts in many cities of the world to change the ethos of the mode of travel and it has proved impossible. Even with high subsidisation paid in cash to individual passengers, they will not transfer to public transport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ethos of the mode of travel in Sydney and, to a lesser extent, Melbourne is private vehicular traffic, and for residents to travel by their private vehicles. We can supplement that process by the use of public transport. But for the Labor Party to apply a selective morality as to what mode of transport people in these cities will use is just an amazing arrogance&mdash;an arrogance that we have seen expressed when they were the government of this nation, and a continuing arrogance that has been rejected by the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The Australian Labor Party is judging the Australian people by the standards of the Australian Labor Party. People have rejected that process. It is time the Australian Labor Party understood that and worked for an outcomes based political process. We have some prioritisation and some ideals for this nation, but it seems futile to talk to those opposite about the processes whereby they, in an electoral process, can gain advantage and support in the community. Obstructionism seems to be the theme; arrogance seems to be the attitude; a continuation of primitive political thuggery seems to be the process.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is somewhat difficult to respond to the submission made to this place by the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), given that he has made indeed only passing and perhaps cursory reference to the Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill 1996 currently before the House. The purpose of the Development Allowance Authority Bill 1992 was basically to allow project restructurings to become eligible for the 10 per cent deduction allowance for plant expenditure. The Development Allowance Authority Act 1992 established the Development Allowance Authority, vesting in it the power to provide development allowance to projects with gross capital costs of $50 million or more.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The development allowance is a deduction equal to some 10 per cent of eligible plant expenditure and was initiated to promote investment in both new plant and new equipment. The amendments contained in the bill currently before the House remove restrictions that apply to projects that are ineligible for the allowance because ownership has been transferred after the application for the allowance but before registration. For example, in cases where the authority accepts that the restructuring of a project was bona fide, the bill will enable it to be eligible for the allowance&mdash;and this will apply retrospectively from 1 January 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The government's cynicism and, indeed, opportunism was displayed when they were in opposition. It is once again revealed by their stance on this bill compared with the stance they took in regard to the principal act. When the Development Allowance Authority Bill 1992 was introduced into the Senate, the opposition opposed the establishment of the authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They did not oppose the Development Allowance Authority Bill 1992 on some mere grounds of parliamentary technicality or procedure, nor were they content to suggest any form of amendment&mdash;any form at all&mdash;that might in some way improve the bill. They simply voted flatly against the bill. No amendments, no particular input&mdash;a simple flat vote against it. As the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) has submitted to this <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> House in some detail, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record of the time reveals this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The member for Werriwa has also taken the time and trouble to quote remarks made in 1992 by the now Assistant Treasurer (Senator Short). The present Assistant Treasurer's submission to the Senate in June 1992 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The basic objection that we have to this is that no earthly reason has been presented as to why we have to set up another quango to handle a matter such as this.</PARA>
<PARA>It was a fairly derisive and cursory passing off of the all important legislation that was before him. Indeed, it is perhaps not surprising that the now Assistant Treasurer, Senator Short, the minister responsible for guiding the bill's proposed amendments through the Senate, had, as I say, nothing whatsoever of any substance, level of thought or intelligence to contribute on the Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill 1996. One only wonders how and why that could possibly be. Indeed, the only comments the Assistant Treasurer made in the Senate on the measures contained within the bill were in response to a question without notice from the Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Kernot). The information he provided on that occasion was what perhaps might best be described as a misleading and fanciful account of the impact of the measures passed by the Senate and supported by the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So even though back in June 1992 as a member of the then opposition he did not support the Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill, he and his party now in government have the audacity and perhaps even the temerity to claim that the opposition is holding up $2.5 million worth of developments with its amendments to this bill. As I say, this is an act of extreme hypocrisy and overwhelming double standard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my view, honourable members should cast their minds back to the then opposition's approach to so many government proposals to lift the level of investment in Australia&mdash;something which I know both sides of the House agree needs to be done. But at that time the former opposition, the new government, not only opposed the Development <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2970"> Allowance Authority Amendment Bill&mdash;a bill designed to facilitate the application of new investment for plant and equipment in construction and other projects around the Australian economy&mdash;but also opposed the Pooled Development Funds Amendment Bill. The hypocrisy of those opposite on these sorts of matters really knows no bounds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The then opposition went on to berate the then government's labour market programs and was genuinely contemptuous of government assistance to industry that could provide an early upturn in investment to the benefit of our competitiveness in world markets. By and large, across the board the assistance provided by the Development Allowance Authority through the provision of this 10 per cent deduction was, in the view of the then government, the now opposition, extremely well targeted.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, by its support for the measures contained in the bill, this government now appears to concede that that 10 per cent deduction to which I have just referred was specifically well targeted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Honourable members will note that this bill is essentially the same as that which was introduced into this House on 27 September last year but which subsequently lapsed when the parliament was dissolved due to the intervention of the 1996 federal election. However, the now government's hypocrisy and double standards come into stark play when, specifically, it comes to questions of industry assistance and investment, as I have just mentioned. Both of these things&mdash;industry assistance and investment promotion&mdash;are not just a function of the expediencies of opposition colliding with the realities of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clear that the government, the former opposition, has no coordinator strategy for dealing with investment promotion. Yet, as I say, it berated the then government whilst simultaneously opposing that government's initiatives when there was an attempt to introduce legislation such as the Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill back in 1992 and, indeed, as I reiterate, the Pooled Development Funds Amendment Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the government now waxes lyrical about the importance of this bill in providing crucial and much needed financial boosts to a range <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of projects, it is simultaneously dismantling the development import finance facility scheme, commonly referred to as DIFF&mdash;the scheme which has been causing the current foreign minister so much trouble and strife during the course of this week. We also know that the government intends to attack AusIndustry; we have known that for a while. We know it intends also to attack, as we have seen before the parliament this week, the export market development grants scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Without pursuing or dwelling unnecessarily on these matters, it is clear that the government has absolutely no vision for the manner in which it can best both facilitate and assist industry investment in worthwhile projects that benefit Australia or Australian companies in their pursuit of overseas operations and the gaining of tenders and contracts in overseas projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, again, we have seen today a fairly unreasonable abuse of the parliamentary process. The government's attitude towards the bill currently before the House could best be described as arrogant and conceited, with there being no appearance today from the Treasurer (Mr Costello) despite his protestations about the amendments that have been proposed by the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now know well, following the submission made to the House a few moments ago by the member for Werriwa, that the Treasurer's mistimed and misjudged announcements in this regard have cost both the parliament and the country significantly as there is no doubt that, had he waited but one more day, a further 24 hours, this bill would have passed both houses of parliament unamended. It is no secret that the ALP supports the Democrats' amendments and opposes those that have been put by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that no-one can really responsibly support all measures that purport to be industry assistance. The application of the development allowance to some projects, particularly highly profitable investments which occur regardless of the existence of any allowance, can sometimes constitute a gross and stark misuse of all too scarce public resources. That is why the opposition supports the amendment <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2971"> moved in the Senate to make urban road projects ineligible for the allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do so because, primarily, it is bad public policy. In fact, it might best also be described as immoral public policy because we now well know that it is the government's intention in the budget on 20 August this year to deliver some $8 billion worth of budget cuts while simultaneously providing tax concessions to companies like the Transurbans of this world. Transurban is responsible for the construction of the City Link project in my state of Victoria which will cause many Victorians, notably constituents in Cranbourne, a suburb of the electorate of Isaacs that I represent, significant  financial hardship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a Victorian, I have particular concerns about the operations of the Development Allowance Authority under the current government's plans for it and, conversely, strong justification for supporting the amendments to this bill proposed by the Democrats and passed in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The electorate of Isaacs does contain a major growth area, Cranbourne, which is primarily dependent on the south&hyphen;eastern freeway for its road linkage to the central Melbourne CBD and beyond via the Tullamarine freeway to the airport and suburbs west. Given the crucial dependency of places like Cranbourne on this particular road, the Kennett government's proposed City Link project to be constructed by Transurban is nothing less than a transport and financial catastrophe for Cranbourne commuters for the following reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tollways deal is a licence to print money for Transurban. According to Transurban CEO, Kim Edwards, the consortium's debt will be paid off after the first 13 years of the contract. This means that for the next 21 years Transurban will reap a benefit of $200 million a year in revenue from the tolls&mdash;a total income of more than some $4 billion. Investors in City Link will be given an extraordinary 19 per cent return. This is the equivalent of a pre-tax profit of some 32 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Transurban has been able to offer this return because City Link is effectively Ken nett government guaranteed. I am sure that roads adjoining the freeway will be closed to force motorists on to tollways, and Transurban will be allowed to increase toll prices above inflation and the CPI rate for the next 15 years. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> financial commentator, Ivor Ries, suggests that City Link will result in `a massive potential cost to taxpayers' while at the same time investors will be delivered `a Rolls Royce ride'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Victorians have already paid through their taxes for the Tullamarine and south&hyphen;eastern freeways to be built and they are now going to have to pay again, and a private consortium can take massive profits. It is the view of the opposition and me that tax concessions should not be used to subsidise private profit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A person of the age of 32 in the year 2000 will still be paying tolls when they retire at age 65. They will spend the rest of their working life paying road tolls. In deciding to build a privately owned tollway, the Victorian government has rejected the advice of Vicroads, the Treasury and EPAC, all in an attempt, perhaps unwittingly, to hurt low income earners, notably those within my constituency of Cranbourne.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Kennett government clearly is going against worldwide trends with its freeway building obsession. We all know now that Los Angeles&mdash;and, I believe, San Francisco and Seattle&mdash;is moving to the construction of new light rail systems of the kind that has worked so successfully in other parts of Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">EPAC has warned against private and unfunded roads on the basis that private risk makes the roads more expensive to both build and finance. The New South Wales Attorney-General's inquiry into the M2 freeway revealed a similar trend. Again, I reaffirm that tax concessions should not be given to companies like Transurban to subsidise private profit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Victoria does have an alternative to City Link. It is called Melbourne Access 2000, which will provide the necessary road links without tolls and without debt. Boot schemes do not work for road projects and end up costing the community more. By the year 2020, tolls will be $9.09 for a one-way trip. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2972"> A Cranbourne resident commuting to and from the CBD will be up for $104 every four weeks and a person using the full length of the tollway will be up for $180 in that same four-week period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Transurban has already received a subsidy to the value of $300 million from the Victorian government to acquire land and properties and for associated roadworks. The same company, Transurban, will also be exempted from paying land tax, stamp duty, local government rates, water rates and building levies to the tune of millions of dollars&mdash;once again, taxpayers subsidising private profit. The Victorian government has agreed to create traffic jams on major arterial roads to force cars onto these City Link freeways, and it would have to compensate Transurban if these measures were removed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Victorian government's contract with Transurban also specifies that compensation will be payable if a rapid transit link from the city to Tullamarine airport, so strongly supported by many Melburnians, is constructed and if the measures that I have just mentioned in terms of protecting Transurban are removed. The City Link freeway will create traffic jams on the adjoining roads that feed on to the City Link freeway and commuters will be forced to pay tolls which they may otherwise try to avoid by taking alternative routes around the particular Transurban built City Link project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, it is clear from the example provided to us by the Victorian government's foray into privately funded road development projects that the universal application of the development allowance to all large-scale infrastructure investments is not in the best interests of Australians and is not an appropriate usage of the nation's scarce fiscal resources. On this basis, I commend the bill, as amended, to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By way of background, I might make a couple of points about the establishment of the Development Allowance Authority and make some comments about how the government has come at this matter and how silly the situation is that the government now finds itself in. It really stems from the fact that Australia did have&mdash;and I use the terms `did have'&mdash;a major savings problem in the economy in that most Australians traditionally put their savings in the form of bricks and mortar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You hear economists and other people say that we as a nation are terrible savers. That is not so. Australians are quite prolific savers, but they prefer to do it in the form of their house and land. They put aside quite large portions of their weekly pay to save up and pay off their house over their working life. The problem, though, that has caused in our economy is that they are left with very little spare cash to invest in our own ideas, inventions and national development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it has been left either to government to raise taxes and pay for projects&mdash;be they infrastructure, power generation, building schools and universities&mdash;or to organisations like the CSIRO to fund research and development in the nation because we did not have an ethic of investment in R&amp;D in Australia and we did not have an ethic of investment in our own ideas and inventions. That is why there is a list as long as your arm of Australian ideas and inventions that have been taken overseas and of profits earned by others who have invested very successfully in us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That came to be understood by the former Labor government and the ACTU when we worked through the accord process for the introduction of superannuation for the whole work force in the Australian economy. These figures will astound you. When we started that exercise in 1987 there was $40 billion in Australia's combined superannuation and life insurance funds&mdash;AMP, National Mutual and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2973"> the state public sector superannuation funds. Now, nine years later, there is $230 billion in those funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new government made great play of the size of Australia's foreign debt. Australia's net foreign debt is $183 billion. By comparison, our superannuation funds, now at $230 billion, whether you think that amount of money is an apple or a watermelon, are already bigger than the whole net foreign debt. The challenge for Australia, now that Labor has put this capital base in place, is not one of paying off the debt. It is one of ensuring that this new savings base that we have driven into the economy is used for productive investment in the Australian economy, for buying back the farm from all the overseas investors who have provided us with capital in the past and for making sure that our own repayments go back into our own funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You could not see a better living example of a benefit for ordinary Australians from this Labor&hyphen;ACTU accord than the existing situation with home loans. The banks are not suddenly out there discounting home loans because they all of a sudden decided that it was time they gave Australians a fair go. The only reason they are out there discounting home loans is that as part of the deal of creating superannuation funds they would start providing cheaper home loans for Australians and members. So they have taken hundreds of millions of dollars, invested them in organisations like Aussie Home Loans and said, `Go out there and win some of the home loans for our markets.' That is what has happened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why the banks are suddenly out there offering people a better rate because this new capital base that we have driven into the economy has started to seriously compete. Even though we are now on this side of the House, we are going to keep driving this process. They don't even understand it, let alone have any ability to drive it. We are going to keep driving this process so that small business gets much better equity and so that large investments in the Australian economy get much better equity. The banks, if they want to stay in the game, have to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> compete at this level. We will find a way to go on driving this process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I see that the honourable member for Gellibrand, Mr Willis, has joined me in the chamber. He was Treasurer in the former government and played an enormous role in the period right back from 1983-84 and through this whole negotiation with the ACTU and the accord in the establishment of a superannuation pool and the capital base.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the areas where we decided we wanted to see the funds invest was public infrastructure. We created a vehicle called an infrastructure bond so that a superannuation fund could invest in public infrastructure and receive the same return for the members that it would get if it invested in a normal private sector investment. We gave the superannuation funds that return by giving them a special tax deal&mdash;a discounted tax rate for investment in infrastructure bonds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also decided that this should not be a thing for Ralph Willis as Treasurer, or Bob Hawke or Paul Keating as Prime Minister, or me as a humble parliamentary secretary, to make judgments about what investments should be supported and what should not. We would establish the Development Allowance Authority as an arms&hyphen;length body to make judgments and to issue the bonds. That is what happened. Once the capital markets started to understand that this new and attractive investment vehicle was there, they started to look at public sector investment projects, such as power, rail and roads, and they started to develop the projects and seek approval under the Development Allowance Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All that went along very nicely until Jeff Kennett in Victoria decided to push it just one step too far. That is why we are having this debate this morning. When they developed the City Link proposal in Victoria we found that they stretched everything to the nth possible degree. Mr Willis will remember that a number of us lobbied him hard to try to get the Development Allowance Authority to knock off the City Link application from Victoria because we felt it had just gone too far and was becoming a rort of the system. Because we had, in the best traditions of what we were doing, set it up at arms&hyphen;length, all <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2974"> Ralph could say to us was, `Hey, boys, we've set it up at arms-length; it's got to make its own decision.' Many of us still feel that that decision&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="PROSSER" NAMEID="RI4">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RI4">Mr Prosser</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And he was right.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CE4">Mr O'KEEFE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, he was right; there was no question that he was right in leaving it to the authority. Many of us still feel that the authority could have taken a different decision, but it did not and the project went ahead. In that process, EPAC, in particular, looked at this issue of whether roads constitute a sensible form of private sector investment. Should roads, through the tax system, be given a special deal or is it simpler for governments or councils or state governments to simply raise taxes and build roads themselves and not have tollways? If private sector investment builds a road, you have to have tollways to repay the investment or, alternatively, governments have to make a payment to them because they have to get a return on the investment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After doing all the analysis, EPAC and Treasury, as I remember, demonstrated to us as a government that it was more efficient in the economy for the government simply to raise taxes and build the roads themselves and give people free use of roads. That is why we deleted roads from the coverage area of these infrastructure bonds. There were two reasons for that. Firstly, there was a very strong case that it was better for government to do it. The second reason was the rorting and tricked up structure of City Link in Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me tell honourable members a little about this tricked up structure. There are very clear definitions in our Development Allowance Authority regulations and guidelines of what constitutes proper investment behaviour. One of them was that the project not unfairly diminish competition or, in other words, people using the infrastructure should have a choice of use.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you establish the new City Link tollway in Melbourne, what choice has Jeff Kennett left for motorists to choose to use the tollway and pay the toll or go in some other way? The choice is special legislation to close the other roads or reduce the number of lanes so that you will be sitting in a two&hyphen;hour <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> traffic jam if you try to use the other road. But if you fly down his tollway and pay his two bucks, or whatever it costs, you will presumably get a good run. That was an anti&hyphen;competitive measure that, in my view, was absolutely contrary to the spirit of our Development Allowance Authority regulation, and the authority, in my view, should have found as such. There were four different instances of Jeff Kennett closing roads and limiting access so that people really had very little choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we came to the issue of the fast train from the airport. There is a very strong view around the world in most sensibly planned cities with a large airport and a lot of traffic to the airport that the smart thing to do is to have a high&hyphen;speed rail link from the airport to the CBD. The latest major one that I have seen being established is at the new airport in Hong Kong, where one of the three rail options that they have built in is a high&hyphen;speed rail link to the CBD. Everyone who is smart is doing it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only did Jeff Kennett in Victoria refuse to condone the concept of a very fast train or a rapid transit link from the airport to the city; he actually passed up an offer from the federal Labor government of $2 million worth of study to work out how we might do it best. Instead he is widening the Tullamarine Freeway and telling people that they are going to have to pay tolls to travel on a road that is already there and that they have already paid for. They are going to travel on it and pay tolls on it to pay for it in the future&mdash;and they are giving the drivers an extra lane to make them feel that they are getting something for their money. That is the sort of tricked&hyphen;up stuff that was not consistent with what Labor intended with the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other sort of tricked&hyphen;up stuff is the capital structure that has been set up for City Link. City Link was proposed to be a public investment and it was at all times talked about as a public float so that, once it was set up and you could see what the economics would be, the public would be invited to invest in it. Well, wasn't that a really wonderful show? What we found when the float came to the surface was that 12&half; per cent of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2975"> $1.2 billion was actually available to the public. The other 87.5 per cent has been taken by the private share owners and the overseas investors. And what is the guarantee? The guarantee is that the motorists will pay tolls for 32 years, the project will be fully paid for in the first 15 and the tolls will be paying profit to these 87&half; per cent of the private investors in the $1.2 billion&mdash;the Jeff Kennett fund club&mdash;for the next 20 years after the show is paid for. And this is supposed to be decent public investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I saw an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> a couple of months ago showing that, under the current tax arrangements, a person who earns in excess of $140,000 a year, which not even politicians get, and borrows unsecured from Westpac $500,000&mdash;and not everybody can get an unsecured loan for half a million but some can, apparently&mdash;and invests in the infrastructure bond which the bank accepts as security gets a 28 per cent after tax return on their money for the next 25 years. What they have set up is a rort to give the very rich in Melbourne a guaranteed bank payroll for 25 years, at the expense of the ordinary taxpayer, when these provisions were set up with decent intention to provide for our superannuation funds, in particular, to take a stake in public infrastructure like this. And they have been rorted away for Jeff Kennett and his mates. These guys here not only know it; they condone it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We set up the Development Allowance Authority, for heaven's sake. We set up infrastructure bonds; we fully support them. But we came to the conclusion that roads were a rort and they should not be in it. That is why we are opposing this bill. It could have been over in the second chamber just going straight through without any debate or any angst if it had just been continued in the form that we proposed&mdash;the fair and decent way. What have these characters done? They have brought it back in and slipped in a little paragraph to put the road rorts right back into the Development Allowance Authority infrastructure bond structure. That is why we are opposing the bill and that is why we support the amendments that have been introduced in the Senate to amend back out of the bill the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ability for toll roads to be incorporated under this investment proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I summarise by saying that I saw an article yesterday in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> which listed several hundred if not billions of dollars worth of projects ready to go under the infrastructure bond structure, and some of them are just fabulous. They are exactly what Ralph Willis intended when he introduced the legislation; they are exactly what the Labor caucus intended when we voted for it and they are the sorts of projects that should be going ahead. But we say that the road rorts should not be. We are not actually opposing the changes to the DAA technical structure and guidelines but we are supporting the intention of introducing the amendment that takes the roads back out again. Any decent and fair&hyphen;minded analysis would support us. The government has just been elected on the notion of being fair to all Australians, fair to battlers, and here they are tricking up the legislation to provide the big returns for the big income earners. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to make a few remarks in this debate on the Development Allowance Authority legislation. There have certainly been some fairly wild statements made about the position of the opposition in regard to this matter. Let me make it clear at the outset that we absolutely support the original provisions in the bill that was sent to the Senate, which were meant to redress some shortcomings in the DAA legislation as it turned out over time, particularly where there were changes in company structures or changes of ownership which meant that companies that had made application for the development allowance would be ineligible unless the legislation were changed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand there are some 40-odd companies with projects valued at around $2.5 billion involved. Clearly, given our support in government for the development allowance and the fact that we proposed these amendments, we certainly want to see them go through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2976"> Let there be no doubt about our position. This is not an attempt by us in any way to sabotage what we see as worthwhile legisla tion, which we, in fact, proposed in government but did not get through the parliament before the election. Contrary to what the Treasurer (Mr Costello) said yesterday, where he accused us of economic sabotage, our position is absolutely one of support for the changes to the act regarding the Development Allowance Authority to enable these companies which would otherwise be excluded from the development allowance to qualify.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another issue which was brought into the ring by the Treasurer himself earlier this week, as has been mentioned by the speakers on this side of the House, when in question time he arranged to have a question from the government side and announced that he was going to reverse the policy announced by myself, as Treasurer, and the then Minister for Transport, Mr Brereton, last December, where we jointly announced a government decision to ensure that there would be no further use of infrastructure bonds for urban roads.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Contrary to what the Treasurer says&mdash;and he said in parliament that this was taken for factional reasons&mdash;there was no such element involved whatever. This was a considered decision by the government of the day in the light of what we saw as developing experience in relation to the use of infrastructure bonds and urban roads, and the private sector development of urban roads, which, of course, was facilitated by the infrastructure bonds. We were concerned that we may have gone too far in respect of providing the infrastructure bonds for this purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, there was a backing for that from the EPAC task force report on private sector infrastructure, which gave us an interim report in May of last year and a final report, I think, in October. The tenor of that report was fairly anti the whole notion of infrastructure bonds and recommended a review by 1997-98 and, generally, was fairly unsupportive of this additional incentive for private sector involvement in infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The task force were particularly critical of the use of infrastructure bonds for urban roads. They did that on the basis that they saw both the transaction costs and the regulatory risks as being higher where private sector <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> capital was used to build this infrastructure than would be the case where there was the normal development of roads by way of public sector borrowings and contracting out of the actual construction arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In looking at that, they came up in their interim report in May of last year with various examples about the additional substantial costs of raising capital; the legal costs involved in putting together the financial arrangements; and the financial consultant costs, which were millions and millions of dollars. They generally found that this was a much more expensive business, in relation to the legal and financial costs for putting together the overall financial plan where private sector capital was involved, than was the case with the public sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They also found that there was considerable regulatory risk. In particular, they were pointing to the fact that operating a private sector road in a public sector network of roads does bring with it considerable diseconomies, and that those diseconomies come about because of the need to try to ensure to the private sector owners of the toll road that they are going to have sufficient traffic to ensure that the project is viable over a long period of years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These BOOT&mdash;build, own, operate, transfer&mdash;projects are relatively new in this country, but we have had some experience already. City Link, which has been mentioned by the previous speaker and others, is a very substantial example. Already we have seen with that substantial evidence of the kinds of circumstances which the EPAC task force had been pointing to; that is, the need to close off roads, for instance, to try to ensure that you funnel traffic into the toll road to make the project viable and to give some certainty of traffic to the proponents so that they will, in fact, finance the project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That, of course, involves various diseconomies. It means that the rest of the road network is not being used to its fullest. It means that roads which are currently productively used have to be narrowed or closed off. We see this in relation to City Link in Melbourne, where various roads are proposed to be reduced in their operation to try to ensure that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2977"> the City Link road can be a viable operation. Without that, the proponents would simply say, `We haven't got the certainty that this project is going to be viable and we won't finance it.' So there you have the absurdity of existing good roads, or reasonable roads anyway, being cut down to help finance a new road. That does not happen anywhere, to my knowledge, in relation to the provision of new public sector roads, but it is a feature of private sector urban road development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the City Link project, Footscray Road, a major road that leads from the city to my electorate, is being downgraded to two lanes in each direction between the Flinders Street extension and Dudley Street. Boundary Road is being downgraded to one lane in each direction. Batman Avenue will be absolutely closed west of the Morell Bridge, and the bridge itself will be closed in Anderson Street. Alexandra Avenue will be downgraded to one lane in each direction, and so on. There is a whole series of road narrowings or closures around the centre of Melbourne, where the City Link project will be particularly concentrated around the Domain tunnel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of this is happening to try to ensure that there is viability for a project which will mean that the people of Melbourne will have to pay substantial amounts of money to travel across areas which they can currently travel across for nothing. But, with the narrowing or closing of these other roads, they will not have alternatives. The traffic will be too heavy on these narrowed roads or there will be no road at all because it will be closed off. These sorts of network risks are clearly quite serious.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The EPAC report pointing to these deficiencies and the experience with City Link led us to the point of saying that we could not go back on what we had already put in place. We had originally decided that urban roads should qualify. They seemed to fit the general nature of infrastructure bonds and facilitating private sector investment and helping to get roads built that would not otherwise be built. But we never foresaw that we would have this absurdity of the closure of roads or the narrowing of roads and the restriction of the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> network that currently exists, resulting in a less efficient arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In those circumstances, we decided that the sensible thing to do was to take the decision that no more urban roads would qualify for infrastructure bonds. It was not an off&hyphen;the&hyphen; cuff decision, it was not a factional decision; it was a considered decision on the basis of a theoretical report from a respected body, EPAC, and on the basis of the experience of the largest private sector road development project in the nation's history&mdash;City Link in Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In light of that we believe it is absurd for the government to now try to overturn the decision which was made by cabinet and announced last December by me and the former Minister for Transport. It is ridiculous to go back on that. It is against the advice of the EPAC task force and it is against commonsense in relation to what we are seeing happen with City Link in Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not to say that we do not see a role for infrastructure bonds more generally. The EPAC task force makes the point that infrastructure bonds can still be used for roads where there is not that private sector competition or network. So there may be cases where it is still appropriate outside the urban area. That is a matter for consideration. Our decision was in relation only to urban roads; we did not foresee any further restriction of infrastructure bonds. As against our original introduction of infrastructure bonds, the areas of economic activity that qualified for infrastructure bonds had been considerably expanded by us subsequent to our original introduction of them in, I think, late 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I very much reject the government view that our decision was flippant, not thought through, and done for unsubstantial reasons. Our position was a very substantial, considered one, and I believe it is one that the nation ought to adhere to. The bill as amended by the Senate contains that exclusion of urban roads. We strongly believe that that is the appropriate course of action. It was the action that we announced in government. We are being consistent in pursuing that in opposition. We are not changing our position in any way from what it was in government.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2978">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We support the amendment to the Development Allowance Authority arrangements to enable companies that will otherwise be excluded to qualify. We also strongly believe that the decision that we made in government on infrastructure bonds should be carried through. Therefore, we support the bill as amended by the Senate and see no reason why we should change our position on that one iota.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The House has had the benefit of a very detailed and candid explanation from the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) of the history of the Development Allowance Authority legislation and of the history of infrastructure bonds and the way in which they have been applied to road projects. I think much of that history serves to set the record straight and indicates to the House that the previous government, having introduced this measure, changed its position concerning urban roads in the light of experience, a decision which was not taken lightly and which was taken to benefit the Australian public and is one which we are sticking to now in relation to this amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Development Allowance Authority and the treatment of infrastructure bonds are part of the issue of private investment in public infrastructure which has, if you like, `taken off' in recent years and which we must all consider in light of experience. The experience in relation to the City Link project indicates that we ought to have great reservations about private investment in public infrastructure, particularly where it applies to road projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently the Macquarie Bank indicated in a report to its shareholders that it had made a $36 million profit from the financing of the City Link project. It is hard for me or anyone else to comprehend how the Macquarie Bank making $36 million clear profit for its shareholders is of benefit to the motorists whose road tolls for City Link are paying for that profit, or to the taxpayers who are subsidising that profit in terms of the concessional taxation treatment of infrastructure bonds. It is not the purpose of roads to make profits for Macquarie Bank shareholders. This shows up <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the failure of infrastructure bonds and private investment in this public infrastructure to serve the national interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us consider how the City Link project has functioned in practice. It has disadvantaged motorists, particularly those on the north side of Melbourne accustomed to using the Tullamarine Freeway&mdash;a freeway which runs, in part, through my electorate of Wills. Many thousands of motorists from the electorate of Wills have traditionally used the Tullamarine Freeway. They will now be expected to pay tolls, the severity of which depends on the extent and frequency of use of City Link. A figure of $20 a week in additional costs will be an average sort of figure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, when you think about taxation matters and so on, any motorist who is being slugged an extra $20 a week, or close to $1,000 a year, has to earn quite a lot more to make up for that. I have always felt that this slug would be inflationary. Motorists who have paid for the Tullamarine Freeway with their petrol taxes and other taxes will be very much worse off as a result of City Link.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Residents who live alongside the City Link project are being adversely affected through increased air and noise pollution from extra vehicles. There are some very ugly and unattractive noise barriers being proposed which will not enhance the visual landscape one iota. Residents have had their homes forcibly acquired by the City Link Authority. The first they hear of it is when a notice appears in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS> and one of the newspapers rings up to say, `What do you think about having your home acquired?' There has been an appalling process of compulsory acquisition and a lack of adequate compensation for residents affected by the City Link project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2979"> Residents who live alongside other arterial streets have the problem of avoidance of City Link&mdash;and it is my view that there will be massive avoidance of City Link. What is perhaps not understood by everyone in this House is that there are many alternative routes into the city other than the Tullamarine Freeway. It is not like the Sydney Harbour Bridge, for example, where you can stick a toll on and there are not too many alterna tives. The alternatives to using Tullamarine Freeway are Mount Alexander Road, Melville Road and Nicholson Street&mdash;a plethora of alternatives which motorists will use in order to avoid paying the toll. The residents who live along those streets will be adversely affected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing about City Link which needs to be understood is that it commits the government&mdash;whichever government it may be&mdash;in Victoria over the next 35 years to transport planning designed to make City Link profitable. There are clauses in the City Link project which commit the government to paying the Transurban consortium compensation if it does anything which adversely affects their revenue and the viability of the project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government, for example, wants to improve public transport in Melbourne, in particular in the northern suburbs&mdash;and there are a variety of projects which many of us would see as worth while: for example, extending the rail network, having a fast rail link out to the Tullamarine airport, and so on&mdash;and these projects are entered into, they may well trigger off, give rise to, claims for compensation by Transurban. So you have here a project which locks in all the transport planning for the next 30-odd years. So it is very bad planning, it is a very bad principle, to commit future governments in this way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The project, as the member for Gellibrand pointed out, is a nonsense in the way it requires road closures and road reductions in order to funnel traffic onto the City Link and make the private road profitable. Because the public roads do not need to be profitable, traffic is to be discouraged from using them. The most celebrated example is the cutting down of Footscray Road from eight lanes to four.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my area, the Tullamarine Freeway is to be widened from four lanes to eight. Motorists are being told, `You have to pay a toll on the freeway now because it is a new freeway and has been widened from four lanes to eight, and that is a great thing.' But Footscray Road is being narrowed from eight lanes to four, and the Minister for Roads in Victoria says, `Well, Footscray Road could become a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> nice boulevard.' No doubt it could, but it is designed to serve a transport purpose. If you want to follow that logic through, Tullamarine Freeway could become a nice boulevard too and be cut in half. It is an absurd piece of road planning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has become increasingly apparent that it is not so much a project to address the Tullamarine Freeway bottleneck, which all of us would like to see done, it is not so much a project to link the north side of Melbourne with the south side of Melbourne, but a project for the privatisation of Melbourne's road system. It starts with City Link, but once you have those electronic transponders put on the motor vehicles of ordinary motorists&mdash;indeed, it will be an offence to travel along the City Link, the Tullamarine Freeway, without one of those transponders installed&mdash;there will be no stopping this technology and it will be applied to other roads. The private investment in the City Link project has become de facto privatisation of our road system. I believe that Melbourne would be very much better off if projects of this kind were not privately funded but publicly funded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party has opposed the City Link project. We do not believe that the decision of the Development Allowance Authority to support this project and give it that tax concessional treatment which comes from infrastructure bond status was a correct decision. We believe that the City Link project is anti&hyphen;competitive and, therefore, does not meet the requirements of the original legislation, which set out that in order to have infrastructure bond status a project must not be anti-competitive. We believe that City Link closes off options for public transport, and indeed for other roads, and so does not meet those requirements. We appealed to the Development Allowance Authority for review. Having been unsuccessful at that stage, we have further appealed to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. I have been involved with and am supporting that appeal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the government acted properly in December of last year when it resolved that the tax concessional treatment, the infrastructure bond status, would no longer be potentially available to urban road projects. I think <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2980"> the explanation given by the member for Gellibrand of that decision is entirely convincing. It was a decision not taken lightly. It was a decision taken in the face of experience, taken in the face of the recommendations of an EPAC report. What the government has come into this House with now flies in the face of the recommendations of that EPAC report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those reasons, the House should support the position taken by the opposition. We have to look very carefully at where private investment in public infrastructure is leading us. It is allied to this concept of debt. Financial institutions have said to governments around the world, `We do not accept your having debt and we insist that debt no longer exist, and if you are going to engage in any projects we want them to be privately owned and privately financed.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That approach to debt often misunderstands the nature of public enterprises. For example, if a local council were required to build a swimming pool entirely funded from rates in any one year, the swimming pool would never be built. The rate base simply would not be large enough to support it. Nor would it be equitable to require the ratepayers to fund that project in that year, given that many of them may not use it, and many ratepayers further down the track would have the benefit of the facility, having made no contribution to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is on that basis that councils borrow to build swimming pools. It is on that basis that governments borrow to finance capital investments and capital projects which are of value to the communities and which are paid off over time. The community has always gained great benefit from those projects. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not accept the view of financial institutions that these things can no longer be done from the public purse. To go back to that original example, we should not be paying the shareholders of Macquarie Bank $36 million in order to finance a road project. If the road project is deemed to be worth while, it should be financed publicly and paid for through appropriate public financing mechanisms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I strongly support the opposition's position concerning the Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill. I regret that the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government has not seen fit to support the position being taken in the Senate by the Australian Democrats, who have taken a responsible initiative in line with what the Labor government proposed in December of last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The City Link example gives the House the opportunity to reconsider the impact of allowing infrastructure bond status to urban road projects. The total cost of City Link has been $1.7 billion. Of that, only $1.1 billion represents the construction cost. The other $600 million represents the cost of financing, fees and commissions&mdash;for those who are lucky enough to be inside the Victorian government. I believe that the City Link example shows this House and the people of Australia generally that we should no longer continue to finance such projects through infrastructure bonds. We should therefore support the position taken by the then government in December of last year and by the Democrats in the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The development allowance was a taxation provision that was part of a successful attempt by the Labor government in the One Nation package to stimulate the economy at a time of recession. It was about government fulfilling its role in providing a stimulus for job creation and economic growth. It was successful. One Nation got the economy moving. We have been experiencing sustained growth ever since, including strong growth in private sector non&hyphen;residential investment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Figures from the OECD presented in the Senate debate on this issue show that private sector non&hyphen;residential investment grew by 15.2 per cent in 1994 and 9.5 per cent in 1995 and is projected to rise by 9.9 per cent in 1996 and 14.2 per cent in 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill mirrors the piece of legislation that was introduced to the House in September last year. It is substantially the same, but makes minor amendments to the original legislation. Of course, the original legislation allowed projects with a gross capital cost of $50 million or more to be eligible for a development allowance, providing a deduction equal to 10 per cent of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2981"> eligible plant expenditure in the first year that the plant was used or installed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the normal course of events, as the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) said, this would perhaps have been considered a non&hyphen;contentious piece of legislation&mdash;non&hyphen;contentious enough to be considered in the Main Committee. But the events of Monday and the announcement by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) have changed the landscape. His timing was impeccable, because at least he made known before we considered this legislation what the government intends to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate has made to this bill amendments which have come across to us for consideration and which would take eligibility for urban roads out of the ambit of this legislation. The member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), in commenting in this debate on the opposition's attitude to this bill, said that we are adjusting our previous policy. He is completely wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) has had the opportunity to indicate, the amendments moved in the Senate and sent across here for consideration with the bill implement the policy of the opposition when in government. On 15 December, in a joint media release of the then Treasurer, Ralph Willis, and the then Minister for Transport, Laurie Brereton, we announced:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Effective immediately, the Federal Government will no longer offer tax benefits in the form of infrastructure borrowings for urban roads.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>Let there be no mistake about what was meant by infrastructure borrowings, because the media release goes on to specifically indicate two projects that were controversial at the time&mdash;the F2 in Sydney and the Melbourne City Link. I quote again from the media release about the Melbourne City Link:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Melbourne City Link, for which an application is currently being assessed by the Development Allowance Authority (DAA), will remain eligible for infrastructure borrowings.</PARA>
<PARA>We are talking about infrastructure borrowings that come under the Development Allowance Authority. That is clear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to go back over a bit of the history of the run&hyphen;up to the 15 December 1995 announcement. As I have said, I was pleased <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that the honourable member for Gellibrand had the opportunity in this debate to put so succinctly, from the angle of the decision makers, how the decision announced in that statement came about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to place on record my observations as an interested government backbencher at that time about the City Link project. I used my contribution to the debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) last November to indicate my grave concerns about the City Link project. At that time I was asking the government to intervene. I concluded my contribution about City Link by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I urge the Commonwealth government to think very carefully before becoming in any way involved in this fiasco.</PARA>
<PARA>I did not use those words lightly because I was concerned about the effect of the City Link project on the residents of especially the northern and western suburbs of Melbourne, which are part of the region that I represent. Of course, the City Link also has an effect&mdash;as the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Wilton) has indicated&mdash;on those who live in the south-east of Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am a bit wiser about the mechanisms of the authority and understand that the honourable member for Gellibrand, as Treasurer, had been placed deliberately by the legislation at arm's length from the decision making. Whilst I continue to be frustrated that he could not get involved and am frustrated at the decision that was made by the authority, I completely understand the position. Therefore, I was very pleased that, in the statement of 15 December last year, the government&mdash;after a review based on available information and studies that had been done&mdash;was able to make the announcement excluding any future urban roads from an ability to get the type of relief that was available under this legislation. Of course, I was upset that it could not be made retrospective to the City Link proposal, but I understood that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the intentions of the opposition, when in government, were clear. Urban roads were out. As the honourable member for  Gellibrand stated at the time in the statement, and has stated today, it was on the basis of studies <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2982"> such as the EPAC Private Infrastructure Task Force, which had been released in October and had concluded that privately financed projects were `likely to be least advantageous for urban roads', that it was found that there was little efficiency to be gained from private ownership of roads.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a position that had been well considered; it was a position and a decision that was not taken lightly. We have to understand, as has been indicated by other contributors to today's debate, that, to ensure a private urban road project such as City Link in Melbourne could succeed and bring the type of economic benefit outlined by other people in this debate, other measures were being taken by the Victorian state government to ensure profitability. They included, as has been said, the plan put in place by legislation to reduce Footscray Road from eight to four lanes to force commuters onto the City Link.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said in this place in November last year that, as another initiative of the One Nation project, the federal government had provided $20 million to upgrade the South Dynon railway terminal. What is the access road to the South Dynon railway terminal? Footscray Road. The City Link legislation had the serious implication of restricting access to this terminal. So, on the one hand, through the direct provision of funds, there had been an upgrading of a part of idle infrastructure and, on the other hand, as a consequence of a privately funded project, the benefits gained by that public funding were to be reduced; and, even worse, the private project was to gain tax relief. That just does not make any sense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we look at this project, other studies support what I have been saying. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age </EMPHASIS>on 7 June, based on reports that had been undertaken and given to the state government, had a headline `Private City Link means less public gain'. I quote from the article:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reports . . . show the net economic benefit of building City Link dropped from $360 million a year to $228 million when assessed as a privately financed tollway.</PARA>
<PARA>The economic benefit of having these roads privately funded and conducted as tollways is </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA>a reduction in the overall benefit to the community. When we are challenged today and told that, by supporting the amendments that were made to this legislation in the Senate, we are in some way hampering future investment that could be made with the assistance of this legislation, that is a nonsense. The government has the clear option of accepting this amendment and allowing all those projects that come under this legislation to go forward. We accept that there are a range&mdash;a raft&mdash;of proposals that have been outlined that will benefit from this legislation. But do not tell us in this place that, in supporting the removal of urban roads from under the umbrella of this legislation, we are in some way blocking the other legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Treasurer issued a press release on Monday. He felt that by making this announcement he was removing uncertainty in the financial markets. By accepting the amendment, the uncertainty in the financial markets will be removed because it will be definite. It will be confirmation of the previous government's announcement on 15 December last year. The release went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government, of course, reserves the right to keep infrastructure borrowings under review . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I am asking the government, on this one small aspect, to bring the review forward and, even though it might be a bitter pill to swallow three days later, to accept that the proposition contained in this legislation, through the amendments made by the Senate, is sensible on economic grounds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2983"> In many areas it is clear what this government is doing and we can see who are the winners and who are the losers. In this measure, the government is assisting in lining the pockets of tollway owners. The perpetuation of this borrowing concession for private urban roads has been described as `appallingly targeted'. But it is more crass than that; it is simply a gift. As has been outlined by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) in his lead response on this legislation for the opposition, it is at a time when the disadvantaged in the community face savage and unnecessary cuts, which will be contained in the August budget. The unemployed, pension ers, low&hyphen;paid workers, refugees, migrants and many others all face a grim future with this government. But not, it seems, tollway owners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the consistent things that can be said about this week's events in a whole host of areas&mdash;and this underscores it&mdash;is that the government has the ability to combine bad policy with bad process. This is not a question of whether or not to use the taxation system or other means to stimulate private investment infrastructure; it is about when it is appropriate to do so. That is what underpinned the measures that set up this authority in One Nation. That is what underpinned it and said what it was all about. Where it is appropriate, tax concessions are an appropriate measure. The economic rationale and the broader social objectives for using taxpayers' dollars for private urban roads is no longer there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill, which has been sent to us by the Senate, deserves the support of this House, and deserves it now, without the necessity of sending it back to the Senate. That is where the delay will be. That is where these projects will be blocked. The projects might be held up if this legislation does not go through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr MILES</EMPHASIS> (Braddon&mdash;Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (11.43 a.m.)&mdash;in reply&mdash;I rise to sum up the debate on the Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill. I would like to thank the members for Werriwa (Mr Latham), Isaacs (Mr Wilton), Gellibrand (Mr Willis), Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson), Scullin (Mr Jenkins) and Mitchell (Mr Cadman) for participating in this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a range of comments made. I was particularly interested to hear the comments of opposition members. They focused on infrastructure rather than on the development allowance. The member for Scullin raised the issue of private ownership versus public ownership&mdash;as if public ownership of infrastructure in Australia is fundamental, rather than private ownership having some say in infrastructure and having some ownership. That is a very old socialist position in regard to community life and government within the country. I think that sort of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> division is outdated and really does not hold a lot of sway now in public discussion about how we develop Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Opposition members want to pick winners. They want to say that certain infrastructure is okay and other infrastructure is no good. They say no to money being put into urban roads, but say that it is all right for water supply. They say you can put money into infrastructure for water supply, light rail, electricity co&hyphen;generation or runways but not for urban roads. I do not see the logic in that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very interesting to look at the history of this. I notice none of the members actually quoted the former Prime Minister Mr Keating, who on October last year commented on the EPAC report. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government continues to see a significant role for infrastructure borrowings in facilitating greater private sector involvement in funding the development of infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, they do not want to apply it to urban roads. That is what they are saying here. The press statement put out on 15 December by the then Treasurer, the member for Gellibrand, and the then Minister for Transport, the member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton), was to try to clear the decks for the coming federal election. They were having trouble with the then Premier of New South Wales reneging on his promise to remove tolls from the residents of western Sydney. So the federal government of the time was looking for a way out, trying to distance itself from that problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those opposite were trying to legislate by press statement. This quirky press statement was put out on 15 December last year after the parliament got up, and it was about clearing the decks so that those opposite could try to distance themselves from the political fallout. We know that 2 March showed that that was not possible the way it was, particularly in Sydney. Therefore, we stand by our position in moving these amendments. I conclude the debate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition supports the development allowance legislation as it was presented to the House after it was amended by the Senate. We oppose the motion that has just been moved by the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) and ask the very obvious question: if the government considers its motion to be so important, where is the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and where is the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp)? Where are the ministers who are responsible for tax and transport?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has sent in the parliamentary secretary, the honourable member for Braddon, who has no responsibility for these tax or transport matters. It is another sign of the government's abuse and disrespect for this House that neither the Treasurer nor the Minister for Transport and Regional Development are participating in the debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also reflects another Costello cock&hyphen;up&mdash;another failure by the Treasurer to get his timing and judgment right. You talk about our legislating by press release; he was legislating by question time announcement. He was legislating by dorothy dixer on Monday when he announced that they were planning to proceed with these tax concessions. The Democrats in the Senate had every right to move this amendment on the development allowance legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The parliamentary secretary mentioned the Labor Party's position and said that we are trying to pick winners. We are not trying to pick winners; we are trying to institute good policy. We are trying to institute and follow <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> through with the recommendations of EPAC. EPAC is not in the business of picking winners. There is a vast difference between the market for roads and car transport in urban areas and the market for water supply. The water supply market features inelastic demand. It is fairly fixed. People want their water. They are fairly insensitive to price. There is no visible demonstration of having to pay a toll.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We say those tax concessions can work on water supply but that the market for roads and road transport is very different. Consumers are acutely sensitive to tolls. They try to avoid them in urban areas. You get the rat run where people try to avoid the tolls and those roads by going through the side streets. It is bad urban planning. When attempts are made by state governments to give those tollway operators a guaranteed income off their toll road, it is bad finance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government should be in the business of following the recommendations of EPAC. The Treasurer should be in the business of following the recommendations of his own National Commission of Audit, which said that support for projects such as this should be transparent, open and accountable. So the opposition says: do not pay the tax concessions for these guaranteed income, guaranteed profit projects. Cash them out as a subsidy if that is what the state governments need to get these projects up and running.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have fundamental problems with using tax concessions for urban tollways. They reflect a cost shifting exercise&mdash;a temporary, short&hyphen;term exercise by state governments to shift the cost of constructing roads onto user&hyphen;pays systems. They also reflect secret deals, these funny money arrangements that are kept so secret from the taxpayers and the public in which the tollway companies hold all the aces and get the very best deal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no need for these tax concessions because in practice they have been used to subsidise high profit levels. These companies have guaranteed profit, guaranteed income, out of the secret contracts they sign with state government. We have a foolish Commonwealth government wanting to continue with the tax concessions which are nothing more <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2985"> than a corporate subsidy, nothing more than business welfare. They are bad urban planning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to cite to the House some examples of how these projects have been an absolute shambles, particularly in New South Wales as they were established by the Greiner and Fahey governments. Have a look at the M5, which runs from the crossroads in my electorate to Beverly Hills. It was public money the Greiner government put into this private tollway. They put in seed funds. They gave the private company a low interest loan. Not only that but, under the freedom of information provisions extracted from the state government, there is a clause in the contract which says that, if the traffic volume falls below a certain level, a public subsidy will guarantee income to the private company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) nods his head. He worked in the Premier's office at the time. He was one of the authors of the secret contract. He knows of the extent to which this is nothing more than business welfare&mdash;that, if the traffic volume drops below a certain level, the state taxpayer kicks in again. For the state taxpayer to be forced to kick in when the traffic volume falls below a certain level is another instance of Fahey and Greiner financial waste and mismanagement, and it is an inappropriate use of state taxpayer funds&mdash;and the member opposite knows it. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

Yes, they also have a six&hyphen;lane highway, because I was there the other day and looked at the bridge. It is a very interesting bridge. It is bigger than the bridge in San Francisco.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Australian context, roads will always be a major means of access. With the exception of a couple of major cities, we do not really have the demand for public transport.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those over that side do not have to shake their heads. Let us look at the evidence. Let us look at what you did to road funding during your 13 years in office. You practically halved it in nominal terms, let alone real terms. I have said to people in my electorate, `Don't think this is an issue of budget cutting. The current philosophy of the Labor Party is anti-roads. It hates them.' Those opposite have this hang&hyphen;up about public transport. As I say, in my electorate I would love to be making a visit to the outlying parts of my electorate by a high&hyphen;speed electric train&mdash;I would love it. Of course the 50 or 100 people who live in the little towns that I visit would never sustain any form of public transport, not even a bus. In fact, their road funding has been cut substantially.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When state governments go for urban tollways it is because they are the only parts that private sector investors are interested in; they want the big revenue areas.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what the member for O'Connor has done is confirm the ALP's central proposition <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in this debate: that the Liberal Party is not opposed to welfare as long as it is business welfare, that the Liberal Party is not opposed to rent seeking as long as it is rent seeking by the big end of town and that the Liberal Party is not opposed to subsidies and tax concessions as long as they go to big business mates. That was confirmed by the member for O'Connor when he said that he does not care how many rorts there are as long as the big financial institutions in Australia are the beneficiaries of those rorts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for O'Connor challenged the Labor Party to point out the problems and the rorts in the tollway projects. He should examine the M5 project in Sydney and ask himself: is it a problem when public money gets caught up with private money as part of secret deals being arrived at without public scrutiny and accountability? Is it a problem if the public sector underwrites these projects by saying that, if the tollway volume falls below a certain level, the taxpayer kicks in with more public money? Is it a problem with these roads if the surrounding traffic is all funnelled on to these tollways? Is it a problem with these roads that, once you get on them, you cannot get off them before you pay your toll&mdash;that the exit ramps are blocked, barricaded off, so that the flow of urban traffic is restricted?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will give the member for O'Connor a perfect instance of a rort, of a major difficulty, with the M5. In my electorate, the then state Greiner government signed up as an aspect of their contract that if a future state government were to build what they call the Brickmakers Creek deviation, to take traffic away from Liverpool towards the Cumberland Highway off the M5, then for every car that went along the Brickmakers Creek deviation the taxpayer, the state government, would need to pay a levy to the private tollway company. How big a rort is that? If you build a public road off the M5 the taxpayer then has to fund a levy to the private company for every single car that uses that road.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) knows the terms and the proposition. He was in there signing the secret contract in then Premier Greiner and then Premier Fahey's <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2987"> offices. He knows the sham. He knows the rorts. He was there watching the contract being drawn up. He should lean over to his colleague the member for O'Connor and say, `Listen, Wilson, these are rorts, these are major problems, these are abuses of federal taxpayer and state taxpayer funding. Let's close down the rorts.' If he were honest with himself he would say, `Let's close down the rorts.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It gets even worse with the M2 project, which the Fahey government signed up to in Sydney. The state government is now restricted from building a rail line along the north&hyphen;west corridor of urban planning in Sydney because, if they did, they would have to pay a levy to the private owners of the M2 tollway for every single train that went along the rail line. That is an abomination. One of the greatest rorts in the history of Australian governance is the idea that if there is a public transport competitor on the same urban corridor against a private tollway the government is obliged to pay a levy for every single train that passes along that rail line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not good planning. This is not good public sector management. It is waste and mismanagement. It is an absolute abuse of the process&mdash;an absolute rort that was established by the Greiner and Fahey governments. The member for O'Connor should concede that smart people learn from that experience. We adapt to the evidence; we adapt to the facts. As a consequence, the tax concessions should be closed down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The City Link contract was finalised by the Kennett government. What did they do? They are putting tolls on roads which have been paid for by the taxpayers and which were previously toll free. The Tullamarine Freeway will now have a toll. They are funnelling traffic. They are closing down eight lanes and making them into two so that there is a funnel onto the City Link project.</PARA>

I repeat the point that when you get down to doing deals with business you will get their interest only in those roads that carry high volumes of traffic.</PARA></TALK.START>

That is a legitimate debate for this House, but we should not be running off and telling state governments, which are answerable to their own constituency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have just had a run-off on all the things that are physically wrong with this Victorian proposal.

That issue has been decided by the Victorian people in terms of their inconvenience and every other aspect of it. We are here to make decisions on a national basis, and the fundamental decision is that, if you have infrastructure bonds, roads must be part of that proposal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, I can understand the concern of the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham). He keeps talking about Victoria, but he is a member of parliament for a New South Wales electorate. When it gets to some of these so-called shady deals that he is so worried about that might be perpetuated by certain people in state governments, I just remind him of the Sydney Harbour Tunnel and some of the aspects of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the Sydney Harbour Tunnel? It is an urban tollway. There is another rather significant urban tollway in Sydney&mdash;it is called the Sydney Harbour Bridge. It was built&mdash;what?&mdash;70 years ago? It was built <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> before my time. What is it? It is a tollway. Then we started talking about bad premiers and good premiers, but Mr Carr never got a mention. He is the bloke who stood up and promised in an election campaign that he would take the tolls off. But of course the people are still paying for them. It is just one of those things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can find a thousand reasons why we have urban tollways but the reality is that the governments of the day are not providing enough money for roads. Nobody led the way in cutting those road funds more than the previous federal government. It is not a question of argument; it is a question of the figures. They are all there to be seen in the federal budget papers.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the second reading debate, the point made about urban roads was that economic studies have indicated that there is no economic benefit in allowing them to be under this umbrella to get the benefit. As the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) indicated, when we talk about the M2 in New South Wales and the City Link project in Victoria, we give examples of urban roads that are being put in place by private firms that have had to be propped up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that that is the rort that we are trying to address. It can only be addressed by saying that these are not the types of infrastructure that are appropriate for this type of legislation; that this type of infrastructure should go out. That is what I said in my second reading contribution. This type of concession has its uses, and there are types of things that are appropriate to give the concession to, but <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2989"> urban roads are not one. There have been examples given by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) of the way in which these projects have been propped up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for O'Connor came in here and talked about the public transport system in Hong Kong. The proposal that was on the books in Victoria, a proposal, I understand, where people were even being encouraged to look for the type of concession that is available through this legislation, was to have a light rail or heavy rail from Tullamarine into the city. There would be no problem; there would be a parallel road, being the Tullamarine Freeway as it stands. But to relieve the congestion on that road to make it more efficient it was being suggested that we consider a public transport link to the airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles), who is at the table, might be correct: I might wear on my sleeve that I am for public ownership in the first case. I do not mind being accused of that, but I am willing to go through the debate and look at suggestions. In the case of Tullamarine, if there were to be a public transport link to the city there would have to be payments made to Transurban because it is part of the deal&mdash;it is part of the contract; it is in the legislation that, if there are any changes made by opening up roads or lanes of roads that have been closed, there has to be compensation paid. And if there is an alternative public transport link between the airport and the city, this compensation has to be paid to Transurban.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of Tullamarine, there are going to be a couple more lanes of an already state and federally funded road linking in to tunnels across the city and then out on to the south&hyphen;eastern freeway, which has, in the main, been funded out of taxes. The public, through the state government, has to pay compensation if we put in a public transport link. It has been mentioned that public transport is in some way not appropriate to save metropolitan Melbourne or metropolitan Sydney. What a nonsense!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The light rail has been extended out to Mill Park in my electorate. There are claims made that it is the longest light rail route in the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> world&mdash;I do not know whether that is true or not. That extension is well patronised; that extension is appropriate; that extension serves the opening up of urban areas of my electorate. It was unfortunate that by the decision of the state government, the extension was reduced from two or three kilometres where there was potential funding under the better cities program. These are the matters that we are looking at. I say to the honourable member for O'Connor, through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that I think this is an appropriate shutting down of what could be considered a rort.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First, I rise to correct an impression&mdash;although it was not directed to me personally but I think it was meant to be&mdash;that I had said public transport is not appropriate. I said: with the exception of some very large cities, public transport is not appropriate. In the context of Australia&mdash;its huge distances and very diverse resource communities&mdash;the population levels just do not support the concept of mass transit or even, in some cases, public transport by way of a bus. Public transport in Australia is still significantly linked to roads.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I sat down, having talked about one of the original tollways, the Sydney Harbour Bridge, I was reminded that the tolls on the Sydney Harbour Bridge were dramatically increased by the then Labor state government sufficient to help fund the tunnel&mdash;the other tollway. That is one of the objections we are receiving on this very narrow argument&mdash;which I say has no status in terms of this amendment&mdash;on what is happening with Transurban or whatever this Victorian project is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We as a national parliament cannot rewrite the law on infrastructure because a group of members are dissatisfied with a state government project. I want to say a couple of things. If there is clear evidence, for instance, of what has been argued that those agreements conflict with the competition policy or in fact our policies, then maybe these problems should be being directed to the ACCC, under Professor Fels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not support the granting of exclusive rights to people. I am quite happy to see an <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2990"> adequate road system, assisted by this infrastructure bond arrangement, competing with an electric rail or light rail link to an airport. I think that is totally appropriate. That is what I said in the beginning is exactly the situation in Hong Kong. People should have a choice and each system has to be proven to be economically viable or meet a community interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that from the day it was mentioned I am still highly supportive of the concept of a very fast train between Melbourne and Sydney. I think it would do a lot for getting a lot of pressure off the roads and everything else, and I think those two huge capitals would probably make it an economic proposition, notwithstanding that the people who looked at it said otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me come back to the fundamental issue. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins), referred to this type of infrastructure. What he meant was roads, especially urban roads. But the point I am making&mdash;and I have to keep repeating&mdash;is that it is totally wrong for this national parliament to be wanting to strike out a support system, previously initiated by the now opposition, on the grounds that they are dissatisfied with the outcome of one project.</PARA>

What we are saying very clearly is that instead of these funny money deals, instead of these hidden tax concessions, instead of these secret contracts with no public accountability, instead of this mixture of public and private money, instead of the levies that need to be paid on alternative roads, instead of the prohibition on public transport&mdash;instead of all these things that are bad that have been exposed as rorts&mdash;let's do <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2991"> something better.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Government will ask the Loan Council to establish a special category for State Government borrowings to develop publicly owned land transport infrastructure&mdash;funds which will be available at a lower rate than is available to private developers.</PARA>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>That was a clear instance of another constructive way in which the federal government can support the states on road funding. It can change the Loan Council borrowing requirements so that public borrowing for these purposes is cheaper than private borrowing. Therefore, the public sector can fund and build these roads and, if they need to, because of financial positions, apply a toll to them, although we think that is an absolute last resort. But it should do it through the Loan Council with cheaper public borrowing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two alternatives that this constructive, positive opposition is putting to the government. The first is to cash out the tax concessions so that they can be paid direct with transparency and accountability to the states. The second alternative is to change the Loan Council borrowing requirements so that public borrowing for these purposes is cheaper than private borrowing. If we do that, the public policy imperatives are restored.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a brief interjection in the debate, firstly, to support the comments that the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) has just made. Coming from the western <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2992"> suburbs of Sydney is a bitter legacy in terms of tolls on roads. Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sure you would be aware that the previous state government placed a toll on the F4 freeway. After much debate about where the tolls could be sited&mdash;in fact, they were first sited to avoid what they felt would be a defeat in the Parramatta state electorate&mdash;they were sited to collect the most amount of money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last state election the Carr government made a commitment to try to remove this iniquitous toll, which no citizen had the opportunity to vote for, or against for that matter. Indeed, notwithstanding the best advice from Treasury and advice from a reputable firm of accountants, it turned out that the estimate to remove the toll was undershot by some $50 million. Unfortunately, that commitment, made in good faith, I might add, was not able to be honoured.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately for those who use the toll, the commitment that the $70 million would be spent on additional roadworks really does not alleviate them from the impost of having to pay that toll every time they use the freeway. There are numbers in my electorate where not only one family member has to pay the toll but two family members, husband and wife, have to pay it each way. It is true that you can take different routes to try to avoid the toll but this merely adds to the length of the trip.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anything that ensures that there is open competition between the public provision of roads, as I think is a major responsibility for state governments, local councils and private entrepreneurs who usually utilise former lapsed or defeated premiers on their boards of directors, I believe that that competition should be open and fair. If there is a preference at a Commonwealth level, we should always opt for the public provision of the toll. Let me assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that this debate is of great interest to people in the western suburbs of Sydney generally because they are the victims of two tolls. It is also of particular  interest  to  constituents  in  my electorate.    </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot of comments have been made about the details of urban planning. Those comments should rightfully be made in discussions in state houses of parliament, not here. The opposition members could have probably been called the `Melbourne City Link members of the opposition' because that is where the main debate has focused. They seem to be obsessed with tollways, yet how did we get this legislation to start with? It was brought in by the Labor government in 1992. Now they are saying, `Some people have come on board and we don't like those people who are investing in some of the infrastructure projects.' It has been a geographic, geocentric sort of debate here today where they have not shown any interest in the national perspective of Australia at all; they have been very interested in their own seats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is strongly supportive of these amendments. During this debate it was very obvious that the opposition does not really like seeing private enterprise get involved. They do not like private enterprise. They do not like people who make profits, obviously, out of this debate. It is very clear that they are anti profit making. They are anti private enterprise. As the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) said, they really are against the small investors who group together and invest money in large infrastructure projects. They are very much opposed to the small people grouping together through superannuation funds to try to increase the capital infrastructure in this country of ours. They are opposed to thousands, if not millions, of Australians working in that way for the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2993"> benefit of community life by having good development of infrastructure in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you really think about it, we are talking about, say, $75 million worth of tax concessions. Labor members coming into this parliament are rejecting it by saying that it is terrible to give that amount in concessions when there are billions of private enterprise dollars for building infrastructure coming into this country. So I think it is time that we really did wind up the debate on this issue. I am strongly supportive of the amendments, and I encourage the opposition to agree to the amendments.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZT4">Mr SOMLYAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, the JCPA has a statutory responsibility to examine all reports of the Auditor-General which are tabled in parliament. The report I have just tabled, report 344, is the latest report produced by the JCPA in fulfilment of that responsibility. It is the result of the committee's examination of the audit reports which were tabled in the financial years 1993-94 and 1994-95.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should make clear at the outset that this report is largely the work of the former JCPA, the committee established in the last parliament under the chairmanship of the former member for Oxley, Mr Les Scott. Although the current committee has approved the report, the report was prepared by the former committee on the basis of evidence it sought and received.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the period covered by this report, the Auditor-General presented 75 audit reports. A good number of them have already been reviewed by parliamentary committees. During the last parliament the JCPA tabled five reports which reviewed or commented on reports of the Auditor&hyphen;General. They were: report 332, on the operation of the Australian government credit card system; report 333, on the sale of Aussat; report 338, on accrual reporting and accounting; report 340, on cash management; and, report 341, on the administration of specific purpose, or tied grants. In addition, 10 other audit reports were referred to and considered by other parliamentary committees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In report 344, which I have just tabled, the committee comments on the most significant <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> issues emerging from those audit reports which have not previously been considered by the JCPA or other committees of this parliament. In the majority of cases, agencies which were the subject of audit findings in the years under review have responded positively and promptly to the Auditor-General's recommendations. There are, however, some cases where action has not been taken to correct management failures or where performance can be further improved. It is these cases which are referred to in report 344.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report contains five recommendations for further action. The recommendations are directed to the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, in relation to any new program developed to replace the former national priority (reserve) fund&mdash;which provided funding to educational institutions for management improvement projects; the Australian Taxation Office, in relation to work it has under way to identify the true cost of its review and litigation activities; the Department of Health and Family Services, in relation to its program of validating nursing home funding; and the Department of Defence in relation to two aspects of its procedures for managing defence procurement contracts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The latter two are the most significant of these recommendations and I would like to briefly outline the reasons behind the committee's recommendations. I turn first to the nursing home validation program administered by the Department of Health and Family Services. The validation of nursing home payments is an important part of the accountability framework for nursing homes. It provides an assurance that Commonwealth moneys have been disbursed in accordance with the agreed funding arrangements for nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For some years now, the department of health has been endeavouring to clear a substantial backlog in its validation program. Advice received during the review was that 5,000 validations were outstanding in mid&hyphen;1994. The department has repeatedly given assurances to parliament that it has action in hand to complete all outstanding validations by the end of 1996&hyphen;97. The latest advice in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2995"> this regard was given to the committee in a submission dated 9 January 1996. The committee is encouraged by the priority being given to the program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, advice from the Australian National Audit Office indicates that there is a substantial risk that the department will not complete its validation program by the end of 1996&hyphen;97 and will not recover significant sums of money owing to the Commonwealth. In the ANAO's estimation, up to $20 million of money owing to the Commonwealth is at risk of non&hyphen;collection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the longstanding public and parliamentary interest in the issue and the various commitments and reassurances made by the department in recent years, the non&hyphen;recovery of this money would represent a significant failure by the department. The committee believes it is appropriate at this time for the department to provide the parliament with a complete, clear and unambiguous statement of the strategy it is employing to achieve its goal of clearing the backlog by the end of 1996&hyphen;97. The committee has made a lengthy recommendation to this effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should make it clear that the committee is not commenting on the policy behind the validation program, nor is it encouraging the department to get tough with nursing homes. We are merely seeking to ensure that the department is held to its promises and clearly explains the management strategies it is employing to achieve the targets it has set.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to highlight the committee's comments on external scrutiny of major defence contracts. In the report the committee argues that the quality of external scrutiny of major defence contracts would be enhanced if the Australian National Audit Office were allowed access to the costing and pricing records of defence contractors. This is a position which the committee first argued in report 337 in relation to the contractual arrangements for the new submarine project, which the ANAO has supported.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The Department of Defence has in the past rejected these calls, asserting that such access would come at a premium risk for the Com monwealth; risk disclosure of commercially sensitive contractor records; and add to the time taken to complete defence projects. The committee is not persuaded that these objections are necessarily valid and, in any event, that they outweigh the potential benefits of allowing ANAO access. The committee stands by the views expressed in report 337 that, firstly, it is not unreasonable to require contractors involved in major projects to provide accurate and complete information in support of quotes and claims; and, secondly, it is not unreasonable that the Auditor&hyphen;General be able to verify those claims through access to contractor records.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week's revelations about the delays and apparently unusual payment patterns to contractors involved in the Jindalee operational radar network does not reassure me that the Commonwealth's interests are well protected by the current arrangements. I foreshadow that the JCPA will look more closely at the Jindalee project shortly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In concluding, I would like to advise the House that the JCPA has recently changed the focus of its audit report review procedures. In the past, most audit reports were subject to a desk review where agencies were asked to provide written submissions to the committee. These desk reviews resulted in compendium reports like the report I just tabled. The committee considers that the timeliness and effectiveness of its services would be enhanced if, instead of conducting desk reviews, it conducted public hearings every three months to examine the findings of significant audit reports tabled in the previous quarter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2996"> Under these new procedures, witnesses from the Australia National Audit Office and from each audited agency will be called to give evidence on the nature and appropriateness of the audit findings and of the responses from audited agencies. As well as increasing the initial impact of audit reports and resulting in more timely and effective parliamentary scrutiny of audit reports, these new processes will strengthen the Auditor's hand in any follow&hyphen;up audits. The Auditor&hyphen;General will be able to test the future performance of agencies against commitments given to the committee at these public hearings. These new proced ures are confirmation of the JCPA's commitment to ensuring that the community receives full value from the work of the Auditor&hyphen;General.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I would like to thank all those people who contributed to the committee's review of the 1993-94 and 1994-95 audit reports, people who prepared submissions, people who gave evidence at public hearings and, of course, the committee staff. On this occasion, the staff involved in the report were John Carter, Laura Gillies, Bob Morris and Jennifer Hughson. They have again met the standards of excellence parliament has come to expect of the JCPA's dedicated staff. I commend the report to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;As a member of the current Joint Committee of Public Accounts of the 38th Parliament, and as a member of the former committee, I felt it important that I make a short comment on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report 344: A continuing focus on accountability</EMPHASIS> . The work that was undertaken by the JCPA in the 37th Parliament revolved very heavily around the accountability processes of the Commonwealth, particularly with regard to the expenditure of very large sums of taxpayers' money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The chairman has pointed out that this report is a report on audit reports covering the years 1993 to 1995. One of the recommendations contained in this report relating to the Australian Taxation Office states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Taxation Office should continue its work in identifying the true cost of service delivery in the ATO, in collaboration with other Commonwealth agencies as appropriate. As part of this task, the project to identify the costs of the ATOs litigation activity should be completed, with appropriate procedures and systems in place, as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA>It is an area of constant concern in reporting from constituents to members of parliament the activities of the Australian Taxation Office. We understand and acknowledge that their brief is to collect what is due and payable to the Commonwealth by way of tax. But when the tax office goes out and expends some hundreds of thousands of dollars to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> maybe collect a $50,000 debt, there must be a better and more efficient way of doing it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is what this recommendation is asking&mdash;that the ATO review those practices. In some cases, and without putting too much of an inference on it, the tax office, with the weight and resources of the Commonwealth behind them, will pursue someone into the ground, right beneath the surface of the ground, if they feel that is necessary. There needs to be greater accountability and transparency in that process of the activities of the Australian Taxation Office. It is easy for officers of the ATO, with the enormous resources of the Commonwealth behind them, to pursue someone through the courts. But if it is inefficient, in so far as what is collected as a ratio of what is spent in the collection, it does not make good sense. I think the commissioner and the ATO should review that particular circumstance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the other areas covered in this report was audit report No. 10 of 1994-95, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Efficiency audit, cash management in Commonwealth government departments</EMPHASIS>. It was a very interesting and fairly quick audit report. It was done after the incumbent Auditor-General was appointed by the previous government. He had certain expertise coming out of the Department of Finance. That particular audit report indicated that with different cash management practices by the Commonwealth there could be a saving of upwards of $300 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend that particular audit report to the House and to the government. They should take close scrutiny of that. It was done in a very sensible manner and with a fair bit of background, as far as the Auditor-General is concerned. I think something the government should take on board is that there are major efficiencies to be gained and savings to be made just by the improvement of the cash management practices of the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I go to a comment the chairman of the committee made in presenting this report with regard to the access that the ANAO has to auditing the contracts of different projects in and around the Department of Defence. In the former parliament we conducted a fairly extensive inquiry into the contracts that were <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2997"> established between the Department of Defence and the Australian Submarine Corporation and the, to say the least, unusual form of contract that was entered into.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We found that with about 20 per cent of the contract being delivered upon by the ASC, about 80 per cent of the contract price had been paid over. It was not a contract which involved peanuts&mdash;it was a $6 billion project. As the chairman pointed out, the committee will obviously now get the opportunity to hold an inquiry into the contract and the undertaking of the contract into the Jindalee project. But the same situation seems to be being mirrored, to a certain extent, in that contract.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a question there about the access the ANAO may and should get to auditing some of those defence department contracts. When it is all said and done, it is one of the biggest spending departments of the Commonwealth. The taxpayers of Australia, through their representatives in this place, and the Auditor-General's office, have a right to know just how those contracts are being undertaken on their behalf and how those taxpayers' dollars are being spent. I commend the report to the House.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB2></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZT4">Mr SOMLYAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The documents I have just tabled represent the responses from the executive agencies to three recent reports of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. The first is a brief but positive response to a report which examined the early work of the tax law <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> improvement project in rewriting the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. The report contained two recommendations: one directed to TLIP about a preferred approach to delivering rewritten tax law to the parliament; and the other to Treasury calling on Treasury to improve its consultative process in relation to developing and considering tax policy issues. The recommendations were accepted by both agencies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second Finance minute contains responses to 12 of the 15 recommendations contained in report 337, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A focus on accountability: review of Auditor&hyphen;General's reports 1992&hyphen;93</EMPHASIS>. The remaining three recommendations were directed to the ANAO, which responded separately. Report 337 contained a series of minor recommendations in relation to the work of the Health Insurance Commission in combating Medicare fraud and overservicing; the valuation of outstanding compensation claims by the Joint Coal Board; and verification of payments to child care provided for JET participants requiring child care. All of those were accepted by the relevant agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most significant recommendations in the report were the nine recommendations dealing with the management by the Department of Defence of the new submarine project. Some of these recommendations were agreed to while others were rejected. It is interesting to note that a number of themes in the committee's report, such as the quantum and timing of advance payments to contractors, recovery of advance payments which have not been used in accordance with the contract, the assessment and management of opportunity costs and allowing ANAO access to contractor price of records, also feature in the recent audit report on management of the Jindalee operational radar network project. The committee is keen to explore these issues further in relation to the JORN project and will be holding hearings on the matter over the next few months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last of the Finance minutes concerns the committee's report 340, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cash matters: cash management in the Commonwealth</EMPHASIS>. The Finance minute, which was prepared mostly <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2998"> by the departments of finance and Treasury, is quite critical of the committee's report. Some of the main elements of criticism are that the JCPA has underestimated the complexity of the Commonwealth's cash management operations; that the JCPA has erred in suggesting that it is possible to establish objective Commonwealth&hyphen;wide rules for measuring cash management performance; and that, in calling for the Commonwealth's cash management performance to be compared with the best practice in the public and private sectors, the JCPA has overestimated the relevance of cash management functions performed by state governments and large corporations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Notwithstanding these responses, it is worth noting that there are a number of recommendations in the report which have been accepted. I cite two examples: first, that all agencies from now on create and maintain their own registers of all bank accounts they operate. The committee had found that there were in excess of 2,000 bank accounts operated by Commonwealth agencies and that many agencies had inadequate records of the existence of these accounts or of the amount of money held in them. Secondly, the Department of Finance, the Australian Taxation Office and the Reserve Bank will expedite the development of agency banking arrangements with Australia Post to allow tax receipts to be credited with the Reserve Bank on the day of deposit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Treasury has also reported that it has commissioned a consultancy to examine options for institutional and resourcing arrangements for the Commonwealth's debt management function, including aspects of Treasury's current cash management operation. This appears to be in response to a suggestion from the committee that the scope for contracting out the cash management function be examined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although the committee will be examining these Finance minutes closely, particularly the response to our cash management report, I am prepared to acknowledge that the committee, like the public sector agencies it reviews, may not always get it right. I thank the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In recent weeks Australia has witnessed some losses of life on an unprecedented scale which have generated a great deal of debate and a national desire to take steps to prevent any more such devastation. Unfortunately, we can only refer to hindsight after the event. Would it not have been wonderful if we could have stepped up to the Port Arthur gunman and taken his rifle from him before he started pulling the trigger. What if we were able to reach into the cockpit of the doomed Black Hawk helicopter and correct whatever was about to make it lurch to the right. What if we were able to send a mechanic to the Monarch Airlines aircraft and fix the problems that were destined to take those lovely schoolgirls out of this world at such a special stage in their lives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is time to apply some foresight and head off problems that have already demonstrated their shocking potential to kill on an unimaginable scale. I refer to Australia's air traffic control system which is heading for disaster. The Morris report called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Plane safe</EMPHASIS> was issued late last year after an exhaustive inquiry into what was then the Civil Aviation Authority. This organisation was split into Airservices Australia and the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. It is Airservices Australia which is charged with providing a safe air traffic control system for the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Plane safe</EMPHASIS> heard the following submissions of the CAA's review of resources which was designed to reorganise the structure of the CAA and I quote from paragraph 11.18:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the most common perceptions of the review was that it was not really a review of the authority's resources but merely an exercise designed to cut staff, a review of numbers . . . `it was fairly evident early on that staff numbers were to be reduced, almost by decree'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is on page 115. I continue to quote:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2999">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it did not give consideration to the minimum staffing levels needed for the CAA to discharge its responsibilities . . . `it was done in a tragic manner without planning' . . . staff cuts were made without an understanding of the value of the staff being made redundant or their contribution to safety.</PARA>
<PARA>Let me repeat that last comment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">without an understanding of the value of the staff being made redundant or their contribution to safety.</PARA>
<PARA>What do we see happening in Australian skies? Just in my home town of Perth alone&mdash;and if I started singling out all the other capital cities of Australia I would be here all day&mdash;and this is only recently, on 17 May last year there was  a near miss between a Boeing 747 and an executive jet only four or five miles north of Perth airport. On 13 October 1995 there was a near miss between a Qantas BA146 and a light aircraft out of Jandakot about five miles south of Perth airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 17 November 1995 there was a near miss between a Royal Brunei Boeing 767 and a light aircraft less than two miles south of Perth airport. On 19 January 1996 there was a near miss between another Royal Brunei Boeing 767 and a light aircraft belonging to the police air wing. On 12 March this year there was a near miss between two light aircraft within the boundaries of Perth airport and on 17 April this year there was a near miss between an Ansett F28 and a light aircraft just east of Perth airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even the recently departed chief executive officer of Airservices Australia, Mr Buck Brooksbank, was quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> on 16 December 1994 as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think that in hindsight, the cuts went too far.</PARA>
<PARA>Was that hindsight acted on? No way! He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Very clearly with the reduction of staff of the order of magnitude of a third your capabilities are reduced.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say that the cuts had left the authority with staff that were `not good managers'. I want the House to remember that statement of Mr Brooksbank that his staff were not good managers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Plane safe</EMPHASIS> report, which incidentally I worked on, goes on to say:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the cuts went too far and resulted in a significant drain on expertise . . . the `massive de&hyphen;skilling of the regulator as a result of the RoR as a monumental disaster'</PARA>
<PARA>The inquiry was presented with figures from the CAA resources review which forecast staff numbers in the Air Traffic Services Branch, which is largely Australia's air traffic controllers, as needing only 1,250 people by July 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the corporate plan of Airservices Australia, tabled in parliament in November last year, these figures had been amended to 2,055 for the same month, an increase of 805. Airservices Australia's own documents show that they got rid of too many air traffic controllers and the expertise that they possess. This is reflected in the frenzied recruiting drive that has been under way over the past 12 months or so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is one thing to recruit trainees but it is another thing to replace the expertise that left Airservices Australia with the departing air traffic controllers. This expertise typically reflects about 10 years of air traffic control experience at the highest level of complexity and it cannot be brought in off the street.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do we see ATC management trying to redress the mistakes of the past by getting that lost expertise back in front of the radar screens? No, sadly, we do not. Do we see them taking effective steps to bolster the depleted experience levels at the workface? Again, sadly, we do not. What do we see them doing in this exclusive boys' club that it seems they run? Before I tell you what we see them doing, I want to take a couple more extracts from the report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Plane safe</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The inquiry has been characterised by . . . a venom and vindictiveness not experienced by committee members in previous inquiries. . .&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is in the preface of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Plane safe </EMPHASIS> report&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ensuring safe air travel must be the first priority. This will require a major change of attitude and culture by many in the industry.</PARA>
<PARA>Instead of getting back the controllers who departed under the review of resources, Airservices Australia is pushing through a huge number of new trainees. There have been considerable concerns raised about the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3000"> quality of the trainees graduating into the field. Some trainees who failed exams were allowed to sit supplementary exams with progressively lower pass marks until they passed, despite the protests of instructors at the ATC college.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One trainee was even told by the general manager of Air Traffic Services division, Mr Peter Evans, that her poor exam results would not be recorded, and she could sit another one because, `We have a need for every one of you to graduate and are intent on achieving that aim.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I happen to have a copy of that letter from Mr Peter Evans, the acting general manager of Air Traffic Services division, to this particular trainee, a young woman. He writes to her:</PARA>

<PARA>Let me tell you what these senior air traffic control managers are doing, as I referred to a little earlier. Let me show you the constructive steps they are taking which benefit everyone who buys a plane ticket. Let me show you how they have responded to the recommendations of the parliamentary committee that produced the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Plane safe </EMPHASIS> report.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to bring to the attention of the House that a dangerous and well&hyphen;developed staff crisis exists in Australia's air traffic control system. This crisis is putting Australia's reputation for air safety and the travelling public at risk every day. The crisis, I believe, can be laid at the feet of a small group of senior air traffic control management who seem to be motivated purely by their incredible levels of vindictiveness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These managers are John McAleer, acting assisting general manager in Western Australia; Peter Evans, General Manager, Air Traffic Services for Australia and recently a feature on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes </EMPHASIS>program; Miles Flanagan, manager of human resources; and Andrew Meldrum, manager of ATS Training College, Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These people, in my view, should not be in charge of such an essential service as air traffic control if they cannot do things for the good of the country. Let me give you a prime example of the way they appear to have been running Australia's air traffic control system like some kind of exclusive boys' club.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two air traffic controllers had a disagreement with John McAleer almost a decade ago while in Perth. They left air traffic control as a result of the flawed process called the `Review of resources'. They eventually found an opportunity to return to jobs they love, as instructors, at the ATC college in Brisbane where they were noted as making a significant contribution to the success of the trainees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When John McAleer found out that they were once more in the system but under a contract which contained a two&hyphen;week dismissal clause, it has been alleged to me he conspired with his fellow managers in their exclusive club and, with the alleged collusion of Peter Evans, Miles Flanagan and Andrew Meldrum, had their contracts terminated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I sat on the parliamentary committee that produced the Morris report called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Plane safe</EMPHASIS>. We were shocked at the incredible levels of vindictiveness displayed by people in the organisation now called Airservices Australia. This report recommended that they get rid of this mentality, but it would appear these <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3001"> managers have shown that they cannot conduct themselves in any other way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While we have the almost daily revelation of near misses in Perth and throughout Australia; the chronic shortage of staff for instructional duties; the inability to replace the wrongfully dismissed instructors; the imposition of extra workload and overtime on the remaining instructors; the delaying of courses due to instructor shortages; the delay to graduating trainees relieving the staff shortages in the field; the chronic staff shortages Australia&hyphen;wide; the threat of losing staff to highly paid positions overseas&mdash;earlier this year, I brought to the attention of this House the fact that we are losing people to Hong Kong, where they are working under far better conditions and for far more money; the condemnation of their vindictiveness by the Morris inquiry; and the closure of the Northern Districts search and rescue office, amid claims of financial impropriety, the managers already mentioned appear to be fiddling while Rome is well and truly alight. For too long, it seems, they have operated under the belief that they are not accountable to anyone: not to their CEO, not to their board, not to the government and certainly not to the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I call upon the board of Airservices Australia to rid itself of these people, who are putting the travelling public of Australia at risk. It seems to me that these people do not deserve to be in charge of air traffic control in Australia, and it is time to confront them and remove them. It is time to take steps to bring Australia's air safety reputation back to where it belongs. We need to head off any aviation disaster before it occurs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is time to get back to staff who are prepared to dedicate themselves to their jobs. Any persons found to have been wrongfully dismissed should be re&hyphen;employed immediately. If these wrongfully dismissed people have not been reinstated by the time this House resumes in August, the gloves will really come off. In the meantime, we can only hope and pray that we do not see the sort of disaster I am threatening about waiting to happen.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should mention, as an adjunct to what I have had to say today, that since I have been in the chamber waiting to deliver this speech I have had a fax, delivered to me by the attendants, from Mr Bill Pollard, who is the chief executive and managing director of Airservices Australia. He referred to a letter that I wrote to the board on 7 June 1996. He responded to me by fax today and said that he would prefer to deal with these matters internally rather than have them raised in parliament. It was a little late to send the fax. He has also offered to meet with me in the very near future, and I certainly look forward to taking up that opportunity.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Support for this statement is imperative, if we are to rebuild a bureaucratic system that has generated a protection system within itself to save one and all from accountability to the aviation public.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am going to outline a few different points here today. The reasons I feel I should talk&mdash;with some authority, given my experience&mdash;on this topic include the problems that we are currently having with the board of the CASA and the way it is perceived in the general community, and other, various bits and pieces that we need to put in place to make the aviation authority a much better&hyphen;run ship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I talk on this topic with some authority owing to the fact that I am a fitter and turner by trade. I have a vast knowledge in the area of mechanics, particularly in relation to aviation. So, when I talk on aviation safety and aircraft maintenance in general, I can say that I do understand the working mechanisms of aircraft, where we are going and what we need to be doing. As well as that, I am a pilot. I own an aircraft, a Cessna 310, and I have had my aircraft for approximately five years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is people with qualifications in the aviation industry, who have been in the aviation industry and have experience, who need to be on the board. At present, we have a board that believes it is elite and is attempting to run an industry even though its members have had very little&mdash;or no&mdash;prior experience in the field. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3002">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The basic problem with the aviation sector is that it requires leadership to make it work. It must be leadership based on experience of the topic at hand; that is, aircraft. If you own a car panel&hyphen;beating or spray&hyphen;painting shop, you do not employ an accountant to fix cars. If your toilet is blocked, you do not call a funeral director, although I suppose that depends on which part of you is caught there. If you have a law firm, once again, you do not employ somebody that is out of the field; I imagine the job description would say you should employ a lawyer. The people who are on the board have had no prior experience and are basically in a position where they have left themselves unaccountable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I dare say the majority of the general public would think like me and I really do believe, after the many representations that I have made throughout the electorate of Capricornia, that the feeling is always the same.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what are the people on the other side here, the Labor Party, going to do in relation to the civil aviation bill? Will they run with what the general public think or will they maintain an agenda that throws mud in the face of commonsense? I think the Labor Party will support this bill because it is a change that has been sought for years. It is a change that the owners and operators of aircraft wish to have, and they want this government to make sure it happens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been involved in the aviation industry for approximately 10 years now as a pilot and the owner&hyphen;operator of a Cessna 310. I have flown the length and breadth of this great country, to the Birdsville races, down to Adelaide and up to the northern areas as well. The feeling is the same no matter whom you speak to when you talk about the Civil Aviation Authority. The general public say, `Be genuinely careful if you get mixed up with the Civil Aviation Authority, particularly inspectors or airworthiness inspectors because they are like the Gestapo.' That sounds a little bit harsh but that is the way the majority of the people that I have bumped into in my time feel. We need to change the way people feel about the authority.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moving on, I quote civil aviation regulation 272:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Neither the Commonwealth nor the authority shall be liable for any expense, loss or damage incurred because of or arising out of the cancellation or suspension of a licence or certificate or an authority granted under the regulations.</PARA>
<PARA>I have mentioned that regulation today because what we have is a situation where the Civil Aviation Safety Authority can basically walk into somebody's business, pull them up and just suspend their licence on the hearsay of people complaining about them, without going through any checking to see whether the stories are fictitious or not. It is absolutely ludicrous. It is nothing more than the enshrinement of unaccountability. Not only have the Civil Aviation Safety Authority staff the power to take away a person's livelihood without an open trial, they are not even accountable if they do so mistakenly or even maliciously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a culture that this board is protecting. I say that it is high time the board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority was made accountable for its actions and concentrated on protecting the lives of the travelling public. I support this bill and I believe the minister should have the opportunity to make adjustments to the board so that the aviation industry will run much more effectively and efficiently. Some of the board members are not competent and are not experienced. We need to be focusing on this so that we can protect the travelling public of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The management of the aviation industry by the authority is not user&hyphen;friendly to industry participants. With this in mind it should be recognised that the leadership of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority is the problem, not necessarily those who are employed at the workplace level. What I am trying to say is that there are many people employed in the aviation system. I have met these people. Some of them are my personal friends and they are copping a lot of flak for an authority that, as I said, throws mud in the face of commonsense. We need to have a better authority. That will take the pressure off those people who are finding themselves in a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3003"> situation where they are continually being argued with or being fought against.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the day, the air traffic controllers, air traffic inspectors and so forth are genuinely good people. They are very helpful. But&mdash;I cannot stress this enough&mdash;if we do not have good leadership, the show will just go backwards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problems mentioned in statements made by the minister regarding aviation accidents, particularly relating to companies such as Monarch and Seaview, are typical of what appear to be major deficiencies in the industry. It is incredible that, as the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) said, the operators and regulators who failed to do their jobs properly and erred seriously in their duty of care seemed to escape any consequences. Once again, the topic of accountability&mdash;or unaccountability&mdash;raises its ugly head.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Each time we have had a tragedy in air safety, what has happened to those people who had been responsible for previously investigating the particular aircraft companies? Did anything happen to them? Were there any major changes? No, there were not. Did the board take significant steps to ensure that this type of tragedy would not happen again, and would be prevented in future? Once again, the answer is no.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It appears that, every time the Civil Aviation Safety Authority or the Department of Transport or the Civil Aviation Authority&mdash;call it whatever you want to&mdash;finds itself in trouble, it changes its name. There is no major shake&hyphen;up. At the end of the day, we need to have a board in the civil aviation system that will look after the people of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The board has made an art form of unaccountability. It is the removal of unaccountability that not only owners and operators but also the general public want to see. We have to put things in place so that if any people who are involved&mdash;operators, investigators and so forth&mdash;take your licences away or do not do certain things, you will have the ability to prosecute.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For years, this country has found itself falling into line with a bureaucratic system. The system is continually growing. All it has done is set itself up with its own protection system so that the people whom it works against cannot come back at it by citing any degree of accountability. At the recent election, this government was given a mandate to tidy up the system. I urge the Senate to become part of the solution and not part of the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to expand on the phrase `user&hyphen;friendly'. I wish to talk about a company in central Queensland. It has a training school which teaches people to fly and a maintenance facility which teaches maintenance. It has recently come under fire because it has what are called `sample exams'. It does not seem as though there is a problem with that. In fact, just about any school you go to will have sample exams; after you have done your study and before you sit your exam, you can do one of these sample exams, basically to get an indication of how you are going to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The staff of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority have stormed in and taken these sample exams. They intend to prosecute. I do not see them prosecuting Qantas, the air force or any of those institutions. This is absolutely ludicrous. I urge the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, the Hon. John Sharp, to take this particular situation in hand and fix up this absolutely ludicrous situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a small business, and this is a civil aviation authority that is basically running around without the thoughts of the small businessman in mind. In this case, the small businessman has done nothing wrong. He has an impeccable record as far as his training and maintenance are concerned. His is a highly recommended and highly regarded school. CASA should support, not hinder, those sorts of operations. As it appears, what CASA is doing to this operation is nothing more than blatant victimisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have an authority that has people employed that works without accountability, once again. If an airworthiness surveyor were to come and have a look at your aircraft and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3004"> went through your log books and so forth and found an error in a log book, okay, fine. If there is something wrong with your aircraft, fine; fix it before you fly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is absolutely ludicrous to have an aircraft stood down and unable to fly just because of an error that was in a log book. At the end of the day safety is imperative, but the Civil Aviation Authority is pulling up aircraft that have no apparent problems. It should be pulling up the people who are investigating the problems, not the poor person who is having to try to put the aircraft back in the air.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Civil Aviation Amendment Bill will not only employ additional people on the board&mdash;which is a step in the right direction&mdash;but also give a higher level of safety in Australia and all Australians expect this parliament to put that in place. I urge this government to ensure that the bill goes through, and I also urge that the Senate gets more involved in trying to put things in place that will only make this country more prosperous and a better, safer place in which to live.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a brief comment on the ministerial statement on aviation safety regulation that we are discussing this afternoon. It is a very sobering subject and a very important subject in this country. I must say, from the outset, that I believe this parliament should take a bipartisan approach to the greatest extent possible on this matter. The statement emanates from the Monarch crash where seven people lost their lives and, subsequently, the Seaview crash where eight people lost their lives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) made a statement in the House with regard to those two very unfortunate accidents in Australian aviation history. He referred also to the near fatal crash of the DC3 that crashed into the end of the second runway in Botany Bay. At the end of the ministerial statement the minister indicated that he was going to instigate a review of the regulatory framework or, as he put it, a complete overhaul of air safety in Australia.   </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That matter has an interesting history. I go back to my first entering this place following the March 1993 election. In the last three years, in the last parliament, I was a member of the Public Accounts Committee which undertook a fairly lengthy inquiry into the commercialisation aspects of government business enterprises. One of the GBEs that we focused that inquiry on was the CAA and the activities of the CAA and the impacts of commercialisation on that organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Keep in mind that the old CAA, as it then was, was charged with responsibility for air safety as well as air traffic control. I think you will find in the recommendations of the report from the JCPA that from time to time there were going to be conflicts of interest between the regulatory role of the air safety aspect that the CAA was charged with implementing and the commercial activities in that area as well as the commercial activities of air traffic control. By `commercial activities' I mean the commitment that they must make, or is forced upon them, to provide a dividend to government, government being the shareholder of that particular GBE.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the recommendations that came out of that report was that those two disciplines in that organisation should be split, that the air safety controls and regulatory operations of CAA should be operated quite separately and as an agency of the department. The air traffic control could continue as a commercial activity outside as a GBE which, I acknowledge, subsequently took place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I forget the date that the former minister in the former government initiated that action but it certainly happened. Out of that came Airservices Australia, controlling air traffic around Australia, and the Civil Aviation Safety Authority which is the subject of a bill currently before the House. I think the previous speaker&mdash;the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Marek)&mdash;was alluding to that in his address. I imagine that will be dealt with by this chamber this afternoon as it did not get finalised in the Main Committee this morning. That revolves around different points of view as to the make&hyphen;up of the board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3005">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is fair enough to say that the media have asked a number of questions, following the publication of the report of the coronial inquiry into the Monarch crash, as to whether things at CASA have changed from the time that it was part of CAA. Certainly the management structure has, but it is quite possible that a lot of the people working in it are still the people that were working within the CAA. A lot of those people are probably very good operators but, as the minister has pointed out in his ministerial statement, they are still working to the same regulatory framework. He seems to indicate that that is out of date and in need of review. I think that probably the majority of members of this House would agree, although they may not agree as to whether that review should be undertaken by the mechanisms that the minister is proposing to put in place or by the parliamentary committee which was the author of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Plane safe</EMPHASIS> report and which has done a lot of the background work into this whole sad situation that is now recorded in the annals of Australian history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I highlight that it was on 3 May 1994 that the now minister was speaking on a bill in the House and during that speech he addressed the matter of the Monarch crash. He  indicated that previously he had forewarned the former minister that the Civil Aviation Authority had been aware for some time of the deficiencies of Monarch Air and that, despite recommendations by airworthiness inspectors to ground the operator, these recommendations had been overruled by senior management. That was echoed in the report that the coroner brought down into the Monarch crash and in a couple of the comments that the coroner made about the CAA. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Civil Aviation management placed the commercial interests of its customers above the safety of the public.</PARA>
<PARA>They are the words of the coroner, not anybody else, on this whole sorry state of affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a headline in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> `CAA failed Monarch passengers'. That was a quote from the coroner. It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was found that the agency had put the industry's commercial interests ahead of safety. The coroner <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> found that CAA management bullied its safety inspectors, protected the airline industry from some constraints of safety regulations and failed to ground Monarch and revoke its licence.</PARA>
<PARA>I have spoken on this issue a couple of times in this place and in committee meetings and I am not in the business of conducting a vendetta against particular people. A lot of the operators within the CAA are obviously very, very good airworthiness inspectors and they should not be cast under this shadow. There seemed to be a particular regime operating within CAA at the time. I go back to the committee of inquiry that I was on with the JCPA. We had the opportunity in a public hearing of talking to, I think, the Director of Air Safety at the time in a public hearing about the mechanisms and the framework that were being applied by the then CAA. This was after the Monarch crash and before the Seaview crash. He indicated to that committee at the time that the regulatory framework and the inspection mechanisms that were in place were adequate. That is on the public record. It has been recorded in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> . Unfortunately, I do not have it with me here today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bottom line is that, out of all this, let us do something positive. Let us make sure that 15 Australians who perished in very tragic civil aviation circumstances in those two crashes have not died in vain; I ask that the government of Australia and this parliament do something&mdash;in a non&hyphen;partisan way&mdash;about the deficiencies that were highlighted by the coroner and that were highlighted in 1994 by the then shadow minister, now the minister. He indicated in his address to this House yesterday that he wants to set up a review to completely overhaul the regulatory framework.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are different points of view in this place as to whether that should be done within the department or whether a parliamentary committee should do that. I am the chairman of the relevant parliamentary committee on transport, and I indicate to the minister that I am sure my committee would be only too happy to pursue that area of concern, following on from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Plane safe </EMPHASIS>report that the former committee, chaired by the member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris), <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3006"> prepared. As one of the members of that committee was the current minister, my committee would be only too happy if the minister were of a mind to seek our involvement in that review at some stage, with the expertise that has been gained and the information that has been gathered over the previous years since these two tragedies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a couple of debates taking place in this parliament today with regard to civil aviation safety. This is one of them. In regard to the other one, on the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill, there are a few more partisan points of view being put. I ask that we deal with this very, very serious matter of civil aviation safety in a sensible way and in a bipartisan way, so that the travelling public in Australia can board regular passenger transport aircraft with an ease of mind; so that they know they are going to arrive at the other end in safety because it has the imprimatur of the Commonwealth of Australia as far as the safety aspects of that operator are concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It certainly was not the case with Monarch; it certainly was not the case with Seaview. Seaview is yet to go through the process of a coronial inquiry. I am not sure whether one is going to be undertaken; I imagine there may well be. Certainly, with regard to Monarch, the evidence is quite compelling in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government of Australia does need to undertake a review of the regulatory framework which is enforced by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority of Australia. We should all be supporting that review, and all those people who have been involved in gathering expertise and information over recent years in this area of very high public importance should be involved in whatever way they can. They should be involved in a bipartisan way to improve the system that is being operated within Australia today.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in this discussion of the ministerial statement by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) on aviation safety regulation. I expressed in the Main Committee this morning my deep concern at what I see happening in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> aviation safety regulation administration in this country. I want to reinforce that concern because some information has come to my hands since I addressed the Main Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Listening to the member for Capricornia (Mr Marek) just reinforces, all the more, the grave fears that I have about what this government is about to do and is doing to the regulation and management of aviation safety in this country. The kinds of comments made by the member for Capricornia reflect much of the evidence that we received when we conducted our report into general aviation and commuter safety.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an industry that is riven by acrimony, accusation and counter&hyphen;accusation. Most of the evidence that we heard was useless because it could not be substantiated. It was an inquiry characterised by venom and by viciousness that we had never seen in any committee. I have been on a few committees and I have never come across the kind of venom that we found in this industry. I am talking about the general aviation industry of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members of this parliament and ministers in government can have only one concern, and that concern is to protect those 25 million people who use Australia's aviation services each year. What I am listening to in this comment in this chamber, and what I am seeing coming from a minister, who I do not think is being properly advised, is information that reflects sectional interests and continues the acrimony, accusation, personal abuse and unfounded allegations that we saw during the inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If one thing came out of our report, it was that this industry and the Civil Aviation Safety Authority need to have a stop put to this kind of behaviour. There needs to be cooling off. There needs to be a change in attitude on the part of the people operating within the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3007"> Wherever you have policemen, you have criminals who are unhappy. Wherever you have policemen, you have people who are innocent defendants, or apparently innocent defendants, who may be unhappy. That is the nature of things. That is why you have gov ernments which try to do the job as well as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If they are going to persist with bagging, attacking, abusing and defaming the Commonwealth officers who are paid to manage aviation safety administration in this country, the members of this government ought to be getting ready for the disaster, because, when it comes, it is all going to be on their heads. No amount of talk after the event is going to put at ease the minds of the victims of the tragedies which will occur. I see it as being that serious. That is why I am speaking so strongly about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about the comments coming from the member for Capricornia concerning flying training? Flying training is an area which we did not get to inquire into but it needs to be examined. But he brushed that aside. There wasn't any problem; a nod or a wink was good enough for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some 650 people in the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. Who would want to work in that organisation? You are attacked by your own minister, attacked by members of your own government, and attacked by people who have got vested interests, not all of which are legal or safe. Who are these people? They are just ordinary public officers doing their jobs. Who would want to work in that kind of organisation? How can you put your heart and confidence into performing your job and holding onto your integrity while your masters&mdash;government members&mdash;continually abuse you, defame you and imply that you have some kind of financial interests in the job that you are doing?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also heard the culture of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority talked about today. We will hear it talked about, by the minister and others, again. The culture that existed at the time of the Monarch disaster and the other disasters was the culture that came from the leadership of the CAA in 1990&hyphen;92. When you go through the statements and comments that were made, there was a view that they had to have account of the needs of the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Culture does not come from the bottom. The culture of the industry does not come from the airworthiness inspectors&mdash;the consta bles on the beat. The culture of the police force comes from up the line. Ultimately, it comes from that table over there, where the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) is sitting. It comes from the government and from the board itself. The culture that was implanted in that period was the culture that led to a lot of the complaints I hear members opposite making now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What they are mostly talking about is the past. They are talking about the CAA of 1992&hyphen;93, or of 1994. They are not talking about the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. There was a mass exodus of people from the CAA in 1992. A lot of the complaints are made about people long gone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the honourable member who has just resumed his seat&mdash;the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile)&mdash;the minister or any other member of the government has knowledge that somebody within the Civil Aviation Safety Authority is not performing his or her job to standard, they should name him or her and act immediately to have him or her removed. This constant smearing of the organisation and the people who work within it is intolerable. The people of this country want something better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me go to a letter, which came to my hand, that has gone to the minister's office. It talks about the composition of the board, as did the honourable member who has just resumed his seat. It refers to the minister's telling Ita Buttrose what the members of the board do. He was asked what they do, and he said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well they provide licences to pilots, they provide licences to what they call Air Operator Certificates to airlines, they inspect aircraft, they examine&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>That is nonsense. They do not do that. The officers of the organisation do that, but the members of the board do not. The letter went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister has persistently told the media, in terms contrary to the memorandum above, that "75% of the board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority have no prior experience with aviation".</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>The response, as the minister was told, was this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The board as it presently stands is the board as sought by Parliament&mdash; <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3008"> </PARA>
<PARA>That is, that this parliament decided upon. It refers then to the membership of the board. It says that it does not consist of four members, as has commonly been stated, that there are five members. The members are Captain Molloy, Justice Fisher, Gaby Hollows, and the other one I will come to as I read through this, Captain Leroy Keith. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Leroy Keith is, of course, the full&hyphen;time Director of CASA and he is ex officio a board member. He effectively is the Chief Executive (Safety) of CASA. He sits on all board meetings where he presents usually something like 70 or 80 per cent of all the issues that come before the board. . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This deliberate restructuring of the board with emphasis upon management, administration and the law as well as expertise on aviation safety, has resulted in a well balanced board which performs notably better than a number of its predecessors. . . . The members of the board have regarded themselves&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and I think quite properly&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">as governed in their deliberations by the parliamentary injunction to complement each other with respect to this range of skills and experience.</PARA>
<PARA>And these words I wholeheartedly agree with. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It said that ensuring safe air travel must be the first priority of all participants in the industry as well as the regulator. This would require a major change of attitude and culture by many in the industry and it referred to the regulator as `being under constant attack from vested interests within the general aviation and commuter industry'. The Minister, with all other members of the inter&hyphen;party committee, agreed with the report.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a quote from our own report. But then the writer goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is impossible to read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Plane Safe</EMPHASIS>  report without coming to the conclusion that what the standing committee required was a board that could manage independently of pressures from the industry&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>That is so utterly important in this: `a board that could manage independently of pressures from the industry'. I go on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ought to be able to reject pressure from vested interests, but would seek to introduce major changes in attitude and culture to the industry. This dovetails completely with the approach of the Act which emphasises the interactive nature of the board of CASA, the administrative, management and legal skills as well as the professional skills involved in aviation safety. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The present board actively reflects the Act and the report. The Minister in proposing a Second Coming of a recycled Mr Smith is going back to the failed days of the review of resources and affordable safety.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not have time to go through all of the comments I would like to make in respect of that, but I will touch on as much as I can because I feel so strongly and am worried so much about what I see happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This attitude coming from members of the government and people outside of constantly attacking the people whose responsibility it is to maintain the standards of air safety, to perform the role of the regulator, is very dangerous. As I have said this morning in the Main Committee, they have placed their minister in a very precarious position. He is in a very difficult position. The writer says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now turn to an unfortunate problem that everyone, including the Minister, has got. It is AOPA for short&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, some 11,000 or 12,000 people who are fliers, people who fly because they love to fly. But they are not airline operators, they are not in the business of aviation, they are not regional airline operators; they are people who fly because they want to fly. And he says here:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Early this year my official internal fax started to spew</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">forth material.</PARA>
<PARA>Have a listen to some of the material. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Dick Smith was President of AOPA. Amongst the `awe inspiring' communications received was the following:</PARA>
<PARA>This is the standard of the people who are making these comments. He writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Liar, liar, pants on fire.</PARA>

Well, it's not the way it is and I am going to give myself an uppercut! They say, `If you lay down with dogs you'll get up with fleas'.

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>That is the standard of stuff that is being peddled around the place and, unfortunately, the minister is taking notice of some of these people. It goes on and on&mdash;these documents ought to be tabled; I will seek leave to have them tabled but I doubt whether it will be granted&mdash;in that vein and one can only have deep concern at the nature of the comments being made about the board itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The board and the officers do not stand for election. The government is responsible for the board and its officers. The buck stops there. Really, the attacks on the board and the officers by those with responsibility for the people who are charged with public responsibility for the administration of aviation safety in this country are a cowardly cop-out. They are a cowardly cop-out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to all those members opposite and those of their supporters who are involved in this dangerous charade that is going on: take a good hold of yourself. You are the ones responsible for the administration of aviation safety regulation in this country. You cannot blame the tea lady over at CASA. You cannot blame somebody and say the fax did not arrive. You cannot accuse them without naming anybody. If you have evidence that somebody is not doing their job, go straight to your minister, tell him, and it is up to the minister through the director to act upon that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You cannot go on with this charade; you are endangering the lives of passengers who use airline services and aviation services in this country by pretending to be interested while all the time pursuing another agenda. That agenda seems to be, from the statements <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> I read in the Main Committee this morning, a payback. It is a payback for people who supported you in the campaign that led up to the 2 March election. That is not good enough. We have a responsibility to those millions of Australians who use air services to see that the system works properly, that the standards are observed and that the regulator, where it is doing its job, is properly supported. Our responsibility and our priority are to the travelling public of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr MILES</EMPHASIS> (Braddon&mdash;Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (1.57 p.m.)&mdash;I would like to make a few comments in the time between now and question time in regard to this matter. I note the comments of the previous two speakers on this issue of civil aviation safety. Many people here would feel concerned because many of us are travelling fairly regularly. As members of parliament we know the importance of plane travel in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most important recommendations that came from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Plane safe</EMPHASIS> report was that there be a system of public reporting of serious deficiencies found by CASA in individual air operators. This is a fundamental issue because if there is public reporting then it will alert all of us in the public as to how different air operators are undertaking their work and ensuring that their planes are safe. It will mean that we will know whether they are contravening the regulations. They will pay the price through lost reputations and lost customer confidence if there is a contravention of those regulations. That will have market consequences for that particular company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> All of us are aware of the Monarch coroner's report. In that report there were some very clear statements made and one was that there is no satisfactory explanation as to why the CAA refused to suspend Monarch's AOC before the crash. This is a concern to all of us in Australia. We must make sure that those people who are responsible for the regulations and observing whether aviation procedures are followed and whether safety is maintained in this country are doing their job. Therefore, this report is very important for all of us.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3010">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The regulations that the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) talks about are a responsibility of the government. This government does take seriously the safety of air travellers in this country because of the large numbers of people involved. All of us are concerned for the families who lost loved ones in those crashes not so long ago. It is important that we bring to a conclusion the safety issues surrounding these crashes.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. What benefits will be derived from injecting competition into the local telephone market? Is it a fact that these benefits will be enhanced with the implementation of the government's decisions on telecommunications?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="3010" SPEAKER="Howard, John, MP" NAMEID="ZD4" ELECTORATE="Bennelong" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Prime Minister" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are, as most members would realise, enormous benefits for Australian consumers from competition in all sectors of the economy. We have seen in recent weeks the tremendous benefit of competition in the banking sector where, against the fact that official interest rates have stayed at a particular level, housing interest rates have fallen. Housing interest rates have fallen as a direct consequence of the existence of companies like Aussie Home Loans and many of the other recent entrants into the field that have created the circumstances for greater competition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today we had an even more dramatic example of the benefits to Australians of competition, with Optus announcing that the cost of a local telephone call in its network would be only 20c; in other words, 20 per cent lower than the 25 per cent charged by Telstra, which was previously a monopoly. It sends the very powerful message that, if you really want to deliver benefits to consumers, you have got to do two things: the first thing you have got to do is get the government off the back of operators, and the second thing you have got to do is create greater conditions of competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have greater competition now in the telecommunications market, and enormous benefits are flowing to consumers. Optus announced today a 20c local call regime, and 15c on Christmas Day, Easter Day, Mother's Day, Father's Day, Anzac Day and Australia Day. That is a good new deal if you want one. This is a consequence of the fact that we have competition&mdash;</PARA>

Graham Richardson had a very interesting book to write on this subject. Would that mine enemy write a book&mdash;and I am delighted that he did.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He described that furious debate in the former federal cabinet about telecommunications policy, when the former Prime Minister was ranged against the now Leader of the Opposition. Do you know what the former Prime Minister wanted to do? He did not want to sell a third of Telstra; he wanted to sell 100 per cent of it. We are being only one-third as radical as Paul Keating on the sale of Telstra. Yet the Labor Party now has the gall to combine with those paragons of pro&hyphen;competitive economic policy&mdash;the Australian Democrats&mdash;and say that they are going to vote it down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When it comes to benefits to Australian consumers there are two things to do: get the government out of the system as much as possible&mdash;that means selling a third of Telstra and delivering the benefits to the Australian consumer&mdash;and have the maximum amount of competition. I think it is a message to everybody in this parliament: when it comes to competition policy, when it comes to implementing the philosophy of Hilmer, never stand in the way of competition because if you do you rob the Australian consumer of enormous benefits.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the Labor Party is quite frequently involved in many of the great monumental beat-ups of history. I must admit that some of the rhetoric that has come from the Labor Party on the DIFF project is one of them. What you are essentially arguing on <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> your side of the House is that Australia's engagement with Asia, which is our first foreign policy priority&mdash;and it must be&mdash;hinges on a $124 million aid program.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a great depth to our relationships with countries that receive DIFF funding, and still will until we have fulfilled all of our legal obligations&mdash;countries such as the Philippines, Indonesia and so on. There is great depth to those relationships. Of course the countries that have been beneficiaries of a particular aid program would like to continue to receive it. But they know, just as we know, that the depth of our relationship&mdash;extending across security relations, the broader commercial&hyphen;economic relationship and the continuation of many other aid programs&mdash;ensures that the relationships we have with those countries are quite excellent relationships. Indeed, let me add for the interest of the House that this morning, when I had a discussion with the Foreign Minister of Indonesia, Mr Alatas, the warmth, the frankness and the constructive nature of that conversation simply reinforce the point that we have a quite excellent relationship with that country.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

Further to the Prime Minister's response to a question yesterday, can the minister advise whether he has received advice from the Australian Medical Association on Medicare benefits relating to euthanasia? If so, can the minister inform the House of the nature of that advice? Can he also advise how the government will respond to it?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8E4">Dr WOOLDRIDGE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Under the Health Insurance Act, the payment of Medicare benefits for a medical service is dependent on that benefit being clinically relevant. For a benefit to be clinically relevant, it must be generally accepted by the medical profession as being necessary for the appropriate treatment for the patient to whom it is rendered. While there are no specific item numbers in the Medicare benefit schedule which relate specifically to euthanasia, management of the euthanasia process by a medical practitioner could attract a benefit under the appropriate consultation item number provided there was evidence to suggest that the procedure did satisfy the clinical relevance test.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the absence of any specialist college which might have been able to provide an expert or authoritative view on the clinical relevance of active euthanasia, I wrote to the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> President of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Keith Woollard, seeking the AMA's views on this matter. Dr Woollard replied to me in writing yesterday evening that the AMA has accepted as its position that of the World Medical Association&mdash;namely, the act of deliberately ending the life of a patient, even at the request of the patient or at the request of close relatives, is unethical. According to the AMA, active euthanasia would not be considered to be either generally accepted by the medical profession at large or appropriate treatment for patients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having considered very carefully the AMA's position, the government has decided that it will not make available, regardless of the legality of the procedure, the payment of Medicare benefits for euthanasia related services. I should stress that, in making this decision on the grounds of clinical relevance, it has no implications for other controversial procedures such as sex selection, gender re-assignment or others that would be considered at the moment clinically relevant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is ample precedent for denying Medicare benefits on the grounds of clinical relevance, the most recent of which was neurometrics testing for attention deficit disorder.

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4K4">Mr ANDERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. It goes to the heart of something that is very important to him and to many other people in this place. Most members of this House would be aware of the problems that many of our farmers, particularly those in some of the worst hit regions, are facing and the impact those problems are having on them, their families and their communities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> That would not apply, of course, to members on the other side because hardly any of them are from the bush.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is acutely aware of the pain being felt in the bush. I would hope that all members here would applaud the fact that next week, in this place, the government is honouring another pre-election pledge with the holding of the National Rural Finance Summit, from 3-5 July. The summit will be chaired by Mr David Asimus, who is well known and very widely respected, who I am sure will do an admirable job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had an enthusiastic response from all 200&hyphen;plus invitees. They will represent all sectors involved in agriculture, including about 60 grassroots farmers and about 30 representatives of farmer organisations. They will be joined by representatives of financial organisations, rural councillors, agricultural consultants and rural welfare and community organisations. It is vitally important that the summit does not degenerate into a talkfest or an over&hyphen;the&hyphen;top bank bashing exercise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have some very important broad topics to cover. For a start, the rural finance industry, past, present and future; key elements of successful farming; and tax provisions for farmers. If ever we saw illogical, stupid and ill-conceived policy flip&hyphen;flopping around, it was from the previous government. I think the previous Prime Minister used to call it policy dexterity, which meant `backslips' all over the place. Peter Walsh, when he was the Minister for Finance, reckoned we had to get rid of IEDs&mdash;income equalisation deposits&mdash;which were the great mechanism by which the rural sector prepared for downturns. We had to get rid of them because farmers were rorting them&mdash;a great line from the government of the day. They were always on about farmers rorting schemes.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having made an utter mess of it, and having seen the rural sector decline into a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3016"> very serious situation, in large part because they had stripped away the capacity for the farm sector to prepare for a downturn, they reintroduced IEDs and farm management bonds. They fixed them up again. They got it right again, but it was too late by then. The damage had been done. It is typical of the appallingly slack approach to policy development and implementation by the previous government. That is another thing we will be looking at. We will also be reviewing adjustment processes, policy and social welfare and future farm business structures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I wish to urge the summit to contribute towards the development of a framework to guarantee an improved rural finance sector.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government in the last few weeks has established a group called the Sydney Airport Community Forum. It is a group designed to deal with the aircraft noise problems of Sydney airport and other related problems as a result of the operations at Sydney airport. It is made up of some 18 people and will involve members of both federal and state parliaments, Liberal and Labor, as well as involving members of local government, local community groups and also industry organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This organisation, the Sydney Airport Community Forum, replaces an organisation that was established just over 12 months ago by the former government, called the Sydney Airport Consultative Committee. This committee was made up of some 44 members and it was regarded, by those people who attended those meetings, as being unwieldy. As a result of it being so large and unwieldy it could not form a consensus and, therefore, make a useful contribution to resolving the problems of aircraft noise emanating from the Sydney airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only was that committee unwieldy and unable to form a consensus, but honourable members would be interested to know that it was also an expensive committee to run. It cost the taxpayers some $142,000 to run for 12 months. Much of that cost was incurred by the chairman who, of course, was appointed by the former Minister for Transport.

This Labor mate also took, at the taxpayers' expense, a round&hyphen;the&hyphen;world trip of 18 days duration earlier this year. That cost the taxpayers of Australia some $17,058.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the last aspect of the question of the honourable member for Hughes&mdash;that is, whether members of her electorate will be able to make comments and submissions in regard to the EIS process&mdash;the answer is yes. They will be welcomed, we will expect them and we will treat them with due regard and great importance. Those comments will then be considered by the government. I expect that that process will be concluded some time in early August. In the meantime, studies into economic, engineering and air traffic management are also under way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make it clear to the honourable member for Hughes and to all members of this House that this process will be an open and transparent process. People in the community who have an interest or concern in regard to this will be more than welcome to participate in the process. Indeed, we will expect them to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is in stark contrast to the process that was undertaken by the former Labor government when it did an environmental impact study into the effects of the construction of a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> third runway at Sydney's Mascot airport. That was not an open and transparent process. It was not one in which the public was invited to have an involvement. As a consequence, it was not an environmental impact study that was regarded by the public to be credible. Of course, as the third runway was opened that process was shown to be not only not credible but also fatally flawed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are determined in evaluating these sites to ensure that that is not going to be repeated by the new coalition government. This will be an open and transparent process. We will invite public submissions and public involvement in this to ensure both credibility and a satisfactory outcome.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question. I take this opportunity of reiterating that this is Refugee Week and an appropriate time to reflect on matters relating to refugees&mdash;those who I think are the most vulnerable people, deserving of our support and deserving of continued programs to assist with their resettlement. But at times there are situations in which people are not entitled to be seen as refugees or assessed as such and governments need to respond to that situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The comprehensive plan of action devised by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and supported by 51 members of the United Nations was set up to deal with the growing recognition that there were large numbers of people leaving Vietnam and Laos for economic rather than political reasons. Under that plan, over 100,000 Vietnamese and Laotians have voluntarily returned to their former countries. These people had been screened out by countries to which they had gone and are to return to their homes. They remain, in many cases, in camps in Asia now. A significant proportion of the remaining people have been resisting repatriation in the hope of resettlement in countries such as Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition continues to be a strong supporter of the comprehensive plan of action. It is now drawing to a close. We have spent over $9 million in assistance. We have resettled over 18,000 bona fide asylum seekers here in Australia. We have worked particularly closely with the United Nations high commission to resolve a number of difficult and continuing situations, particularly those relating to split families. We have also brought to the attention of the United Nations situations where, it has been suggested, the processing of claims has not been adequate. Having seen the processing of the United Nations high commissioner, we are now in a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> situation where the remaining 30,000 asylum seekers in camps throughout Asia will be asked to return to their countries of origin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are in a situation now where Malaysia has just completed the processing and has closed its camps. The Vietnamese community has been asking many of us to look at the situation and to look at whether or not further steps can be taken to resettle people here in Australia and elsewhere. I think the situation needs to be clearly understood that in these cases the people have been properly assessed. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has monitored progress. We have raised concerns where they have been raised with us about individuals. The situation now is one where the countries concerned that continue to have asylum seekers who have been screened out will have to return them, both compulsorily and voluntarily. A voluntary arrangement is to be preferred but if it cannot be completed in that way, orderly repatriation will be supported by Australia.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I draw your attention and the attention of all members to what I believe has been a gross abuse of the prerogatives and privileges of this parliament. I refer to the very serious allegations that were made in the last parliament&mdash;under privilege of course&mdash;that Mr Mark Leibler, a constituent of mine, a prominent citizen, a prominent Melbourne lawyer and a leader of the Jewish community, was guilty of distributing pornographic material and laundering money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That allegation was based on a series of documents which were found, on investigation by the Federal Police, to be false. I would have expected and hoped that the member involved would have apologised and withdrawn those allegations, but in fact&mdash;if anything&mdash;he continued to assert them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program last Monday and in the current issue of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Israel Review</EMPHASIS>, the circumstances surrounding the production of that material have been dealt with at great length. It amounts to what I would regard as a serious criminal conspiracy by members of the LaRouche group who set out to smear and defame members and leaders of the Jewish community. That is the allegation being made. It has been documented at great length in this article and it was explored in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program. The former member concerned was invited to participate in that program and did not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My concern is to raise this issue in two ways. First of all, I believe that the privileges that attach to members in this parliament are an essential and vital part of our parliamentary process. In the past, it seems to me that it has been the practice that, if a member gets his facts wrong, and a citizen's reputation is besmirched, the member in the wrong apologises and withdraws. But in this case, what we have is clearly a conspiracy to use the forms and processes of this House in a way in which they were never meant to be used.  </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3024">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first question, sir, that I would direct to your attention is whether, in those circumstances, that abuse constitutes in itself a breach of the prerogatives of this parliament. If not, what are the proper forms and processes, where our institution is used in this way to demean and discredit a public citizen carrying out his religious beliefs and his duties, to protect him from this kind of smear against which he cannot resort to the normal legal protection? I would ask you, Mr Speaker, if you share my concern, to perhaps consider referring this very important matter to the Privileges Committee because the reputation of all members of this parliament, and our processes and prerogatives, are very much involved and at stake.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to know I am not as horizontally visible as I thought I was. I draw your attention to an incident which, I understand, occurred on Tuesday night, where <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3025"> a member of this House who was about to be taken on a journey by a House of Representatives transport car refused to wear a seat belt and, as a result of that, the driver refused to take him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not wish to pursue this particular incident, but I do wish to raise a broader question: that is, the nature of obligations which members of this place undertake with respect to their behaviour when they are in the hands of the House of Representatives transport service. In particular, my brief inquiries have revealed that there is nothing specified in writing with respect to how members do behave, and there are a number of areas of potential conflict which could arise. For example, members may at times ask a driver to break the road rules in order to get to a place quicker than they otherwise would. They could possibly ask for a car to be used for unauthorised purposes. They could possibly ask a driver to overload the car with excessive numbers of passengers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Drivers of Comcars for the House of Representatives transport service are sometimes in a difficult position, because their customers are in an indirect way also their bosses. If their direct boss says one thing and the customer says the opposite, that can place them in a very difficult position. I would ask the Speaker whether he can advise the House what arrangements are in place, if any, to ensure that members do conduct themselves properly in Comcars, do not defy legitimate requests of the driver or give them incorrect or unlawful instructions. If not, can he do something to correct that situation?</PARA></QUESTION>

<TIME.STAMP>(3.15 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;For the information of honourable members, I present the report on the deaths of Australian based journalists in East Timor in 1975, prepared by Mr Tom Sherman, AO, the former Chairman <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the National Crime Authority. As many honourable members will know, the journalists were Gary Cunningham, Roger East, Brian Peters, Malcolm Rennie, Greg Shackleton and Tony Stewart.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Sherman was appointed by the previous government in November 1995 following claims that there was additional information available on the deaths, especially from East Timorese living abroad. Mr Sherman's brief was `to gather such new evidence as may be available from these sources&mdash;fully respecting such confidentiality requirements as witnesses may seek to impose&mdash;and to evaluate its prima facie weight'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following the change of government, I made it clear that the new government was prepared to see Mr Sherman's process through to completion, even though we did not initiate the exercise. The circumstances surrounding the deaths of these six journalists have continued to remain a matter of concern to the relatives of the deceased and, more generally, of public interest over the years. We have therefore fully cooperated with Mr Sherman.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would highlight that the government has been thoroughly transparent on this issue. In this context I record that Mr Sherman approached me towards the end of his evaluation and asked for access to all relevant intelligence material held by the government. In considering his request, I was conscious that this material had never been reviewed outside of government before. I decided, after consultation with my colleague the Minister for Defence, Mr McLachlan, that Mr Sherman should have access to all relevant intelligence material, including material from the Defence Signals Directorate and the Australian Secret Intelligence Service. His clear conclusion on this material is set out in paragraph 2.32. I hope this will settle the various questions which have surrounded this aspect of the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Sherman handed over his report to me last Friday and, contrary to media reports, there is one report only and there are no confidential annexes. I am tabling the report in its entirety. I thank Mr Sherman for the care and attention he has devoted to this important task. Mr Sherman has now retired <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3030"> from public service, but I want to express the government's appreciation for the manner in which he has discharged his responsibilities in this and, for that matter, earlier appointments. I am sure the opposition joins us in doing so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The findings in Mr Sherman's report are summarised in chapter 9 on page 136. There are two keys findings. The first is that it is more likely than not that Gary Cunningham, Brian Peters, Malcolm Rennie, Greg Shackleton and Tony Stewart were killed at Balibo early in the morning of 16 October 1975, probably before 7 a.m., by members of an attacking force under Indonesian officers consisting of Indonesian irregular troops and anti&hyphen;Fretilin Timorese; and, in circumstances of continuing fighting between the Fretilin and anti&hyphen;Fretilin forces. Elsewhere in the report at page 110, paragraph 5.86, this conclusion is expressed in the phrase `it is more likely than not that the Balibo Five were killed in the heat of battle while fighting was still taking place'. Secondly, the report finds that it is more likely than not that Roger East was summarily executed by an unidentified Indonesian soldier late in the morning of 8 December 1975 in the wharf area of Dili.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have considered Mr Sherman's report very carefully. I believe that it is as thorough an account of the circumstances of the journalists' deaths as is likely to be possible, based on information available outside Indonesia and given the passage of time. We simply do not have any other information on which to base further analysis or more definitive conclusions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not going to comment in detail on Mr Sherman's findings, as the report speaks clearly enough for itself. However, the fact that the findings do not identify individuals responsible for the killings and are ultimately expressions of probability creates limitations on the action available to the Australian government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also clear from Mr Sherman's report that it is unlikely that any significant further relevant information is available outside of Indonesia. Therefore, any further investigation initiated in this country is unlikely to produce any additional findings. Accordingly, I have <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> written to my Indonesian counterpart asking him to pursue any further information which would throw additional light on the conclusions reached, and I have spoken to him this morning in the terms of the letter. I am happy today to table that letter, along with the Sherman report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say, however, that we all need to be clear that we cannot compel the Indonesian authorities to do something which is within their own sovereign jurisdiction, any more than they can compel the Australian authorities to do something which we might or might not want to do. In the interests of bipartisanship on this issue, let me quote the then Senator Evans who, in an interview last year, said `our problem of course is that you can't mount an investigation in another country, any more than any country can come to Australia and mount unilaterally some kind of investigation on some matter of concern to it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In its approach to the report the government has had as its primary concern the interests of the next of kin. In the course of Tuesday and Wednesday, officers of my department and members of my staff spoke at length with the next of kin outlining the report's findings and answering their questions. Although these events occurred 20 years ago, the report will obviously awaken painful memories for family members but I hope it will also settle some of the uncertainties.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The opposition welcomes the tabling of the report of the Sherman inquiry, which was set in train last November by the then Labor government's foreign minister, Gareth Evans. We received a copy of the report this morning from the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer). To the extent that we have been able to evaluate Mr Sherman's report, it appears to be comprehensive and to address the complex and, indeed, sensitive issues that are involved. Given the difficulties inherent in securing the cooperation of witnesses concerned about confidentiality and the obvious difficulties of taking evidence in Indonesia itself, including in East Timor, one certainly cannot conclude that a more formal judicial inquiry would have <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3031"> produced, or could even now produce, a more extensive or reliable set of findings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) has said, the most important conclusion of the report as far as the Balibo Five are concerned&mdash;it includes journalists Gary Cunningham, Brian Peters, Malcolm Rennie, Greg Shackleton and Tony Stewart&mdash;is that it is more likely than not they were killed by members of an attacking force under Indonesian officers consisting of Indonesian irregular troops and anti-Fretilin East Timorese and in circumstances of continuing fighting between Fretilin and anti-Fretilin forces. It needs to be said that the most important revelation in the entire report, and the one that may be of most significance in determining the Indonesian government's response to it, is the reported admission by Indonesian general and former defence minister Benny Murdani, supported in the report by admissions from General Dading, that the Australians were `in between Fretilin and the advancing Indonesian troops'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key conclusion as far as the other journalist, Roger East, is concerned raises serious questions for the Indonesian government. That conclusion is that it was more likely than not that he was summarily executed by an unidentified Indonesian soldier in the wharf area in Dili. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The obvious next step for the report is that it be forwarded to the Indonesian government for its consideration and response with a request for advice or any further information which would throw additional light on the conclusions reached. In this respect, I can say that the opposition supports the actions that the government has taken. We reserve our position on what further action might be possible or appropriate to take until after that response has been received.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> As the Minister for Foreign Affairs said in his statement, this report will certainly rekindle some very painful memories for the families of the dead journalists. The hearts of everyone in this House go out to those families. One reason for initiating the report was to try to bring some greater sense of certainty into our understanding of the tragic events, which have remained shrouded in consider able mystery ever since. I conclude by saying that if some of that shroud proves to have been lifted by this report, it will have admirably served its purpose.</PARA></SPEECH>

<ELECTORATE> (Calare)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(3.26 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I wish to speak on the statement from the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) because I had a close connection with the events surrounding this tragedy. In October 1975, I was a news producer at TCN9 in Sydney from where Sydney based cameraman Brian Peters and Melbourne based journalist Malcolm Rennie travelled to Dili to cover the escalating unrest in the Portuguese colony of East Timor.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was a close colleague and friend of Brian Peters, with whom I had worked earlier in my career at Channel 7 in Sydney. Brian had been to East Timor several weeks prior to what was to be that fatal second trip. He had accompanied senior executives of TCN9 on a boat trip from Darwin. During that first foray into civil war, Brian established what I later understood were firm friendships with and sympathies towards certain elements of the pro&hyphen;independence Fretilin movement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the weekend prior to his second trip to Dili, I went skiing with him and another friend at Perisher Valley. He wore the battle fatigues&mdash;from memory, the trousers&mdash;of the Fretilin forces. He told me of this souvenir from his new friends in Dili. Given the situation in Dili at the time&mdash;I am relying on memory&mdash;there were UDT and APODETI factions loyal to an anti-Fretilin coalition of forces either supporting the integration of East Timor with Indonesia or, in the case of UDT, conservative and middle&hyphen;of&hyphen;the&hyphen;road forces, a major rival of Fretilin, as described by Tom Sherman in this report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Brian Peters's sympathies were likely to have been well known throughout East Timor. It casts no long bow to believe that the Indonesian authorities knew exactly who he was and where his sympathies lay. Once he returned to East Timor and ventured into hostile territory with the assistance of Fretilin forces, he was a marked man, and so too were his colleagues. This is no criticism of any of those newsmen, particularly Brian. It is, though, a severe criticism of the system that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3032"> sent them there. I do not believe that the newsmen were well enough briefed, and their ill-advised decision to try to cross the battlelines and report the invasion from the Indonesian side was tragically naive in the extreme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report has brought back one of the most distressing periods of my professional life. The peer pressure to travel to the front and then cross the lines was driven by competition between the two rival networks for the scoop of a major conflict on our borders. I believe that this clouded the judgment of all the people involved. Given the information I believe was in the hands of the television companies, our spies in Dili and the Australian government, I think it was sheer folly to allow these men to undertake that trip. The report quotes one of the competing news editors from Channel 7 as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was always the danger of competition&mdash;but I presumed they would not risk their lives to get a scoop.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr John Maher, that editor, goes on to say that he was not aware that Channel 9 was also sending a crew when he sent Greg Shackleton, Tony Stewart and Gary Cunningham. From memory, the Channel 9 crew was sent in great haste to try to catch the Channel 7 crew. Comments of Brian Peters to witnesses in Dili recorded in the report quote him saying that he had to get to the border because Channel 7 was there and he could be in trouble with his bosses. I know from a personal point of view that such was the greater than usual competition in the news services at the time with a new Sydney-Melbourne Channel 9 news link-up called News Centre 9. Several important executive reputations were riding on the result. I have no doubt Brian Peters's observations had even more meaning then. He was being driven not only by his professional news instincts but also by some very powerful expectations in his company's news hierarchy that went right to the very top.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have not read this report in detail. I deliberated over whether to make a formal submission to it. I decided that there had been too many expedient excuses made over East Timor and that it was not worth anyone's <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> while. However, these comments are now on the public record. I believe that these men were murdered by forces under Indonesian control. Whether they were irregular or regular Indonesian troops we may never know.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do believe that prior intelligence on the crew's movements, and particularly Brian Peters's first visit to Dili and the contacts he made, made their fate inevitable. Only a stronger response by the Whitlam government at the time to the threatened invasion could have avoided the loss of these men and the tragedy that East Timor has become for its population in the years since.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition this afternoon wants to turn to the very serious implications of the government's decision to cancel DIFF projects, particularly those projects that are in the pipeline. When I say `the DIFF pipeline', they are projects in respect of which considerable investments have been made on the basis of bilateral agreements between Australia and our neighbours in these developing countries in our region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an issue which has preoccupied the attention of this House for most of this week. While we have been concentrating on the replies&mdash;the inadequacy of the replies&mdash;of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer), insufficient attention has been given to the implications for the projects themselves.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3033">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say at the outset that we believe that what we have on our hands is extraordinarily bad policy. That bad policy decision was announced on the eve of the last election by the then opposition as part of their <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meeting our commitments</EMPHASIS> document. It is bad policy with serious implications for our regional relationships, for our very engagement in the region and for every one of the multitude of companies that have been involved in pursuing international opportunities under what has been an extraordinarily successful scheme, one that has done so much to give substance to our engagement in the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the last few weeks I have had numerous approaches from company after company that has been involved in this process and that in some cases have had their businesses destroyed by what they have been quick to point out was an unbelievably bad decision, one that has in their case a retrospective effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are 52 projects in the DIFF pipeline. I want to start by dealing with them. They are projects involving not 52 companies but some 600 Australian companies, all told. Sixty per cent of all of these projects have been going now for at least 1&half; to two years. These are all projects that have gone right through the feasibility study stage and the appraisal stage right through to the project design and detail stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are 52 projects, 60 per cent of which have been worked on for a period of years and in respect of which tens of millions of dollars have been expended in good faith, on the basis of bilateral relationships and on the basis of committed government policy. It was on this basis that an agreement was signed&mdash;the Deputy Speaker would be aware of this&mdash;between President Ramos of the Philippines and Australia at Williamtown to carry out a wide range of what are to the Philippines enormously important projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The estimate of the amount of money expended thus far on projects that have been arbitrarily cancelled is $67 million. In some cases, this means bankruptcy for the proponents. I repeat that proponents have acted in good faith. These people have been to see me and have told me of their dilemma. They have asked, `What do we say to our partners?' <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> There are partners involved in all these projects; 40 per cent of the projects have counterpart funding, where the recipients themselves have spent money in preparation. So it is not just at the Australian end; 40 per cent of those projects have seen money spent by our neighbours in pursuing the matter from their point of view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They ask, `What do we say to the people we are doing business with? How do we maintain our faith in the light of what the government has done, retrospectively'&mdash;as far as these projects are concerned&mdash;`wiping them out?' They ask, `What do we say to our bank manager, when we have spent $100,000, $200,000 and $300,000?' It is often small Australian companies, which have been out there doing their best as part of Australia's export drive, asking, `What do we say to our bank managers when we have no comeback, no recourse? Our project has been arbitrarily halted.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have seen some bad policies, but I have never seen one that was less well thought through than this one&mdash;from a government that has been boasting about its commitment to small and medium Australian companies. It is really quite astonishing that a policy like this could be brought out on the eve of an election but not reviewed post&hyphen;election once the implications of the abolition of DIFF, as far as projects in the pipeline are concerned, became known.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can only put this down to the fact that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who is principally responsible for this, has not, from the very first moment, taken the implications seriously. He has not taken them seriously as far as these companies are concerned; he has not taken them seriously as far as our regional relations are concerned; he has not taken them seriously as far as the blow that it represents to our engagement in the region is concerned. He has been all too smart in passing it off as something that is a mere storm in a teacup. Day after day in the parliament over these last days he has stood here telling the House that this is not of any real importance. When he was not being absolutely evasive, he was being worse.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3034">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as these projects are concerned, the House should be aware that the overwhelming majority of them involve enormously worthwhile projects. As far as the 17 in China are concerned, the Chinese government takes the view&mdash;I think quite properly&mdash;that they are the subject of a formal agreement between Australia and China. They are used to those formal agreements having the force of law. They take a very dim view of an Australian government which comes along and says that unless there is a contract individually committed by an Australian company&mdash;in other words, unless you have gone right through the feasibility study stage and through to the development of all the project detail stages&mdash;and unless you have actually signed a contract, then this can be retrospectively cancelled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Chinese government&mdash;I think quite properly&mdash;says that those things are between government and government and they should proceed. And, of course, they have all been wiped out. When you look at the individual projects, you see projects that go to the very core of poverty alleviation and the easing of distress in developing countries, whether it be water improvement, sanitation improvement, environmental monitoring&mdash;a whole range of projects aimed at lifting the living standards, of improving the circumstances in these fast-growing nations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is that problem that the House must be aware of, and it is that problem which the Minister for Foreign Affairs has delegated to his parliamentary secretary to handle. It is really quite an extraordinary decision for a government to cancel, retrospectively, 52 different projects coming under agreements between our neighbours and ourselves, involving $67 million worth of money privately expended already, and for the handling of that matter to be delegated to the parliamentary secretary, a parliamentary secretary who has not given any satisfaction whatsoever to the proponents of the individual DIFF projects when they have beaten a path to his door. It is fair to point out that they have been denied access to the minister himself. This has all been dealt with by pushing it down the line to the parliamentary secretary.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think this gives some sort of a flavour of what has really happened here. The DIFF project has not been properly and seriously considered by the government and it has fallen in a hole accordingly. Indeed, it has not been helped by the fact that the government has gone out of its way to say of late that it is to do with its invented budgetary black hole, whereas the House knows full well that this was part of its <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meeting our commitments</EMPHASIS> document, it was a determined policy before the election, it does not relate to any budgetary deficit whatsoever but it relates strictly to its funding a number of tax relief measures for the middle classes. That is the truth of the matter. But $67 million is written off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is going to be saved out of this? One hundred and twenty million dollars of government expenditure, $120 million which the government and AusAID's own review said would have a multiplier effect fivefold in terms of benefits for Australia.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FB6">Mr ANDREW THOMSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not my job to make noise during question time, such as seems to be your role, my friend. With that said, in paying attention to what the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith said during his speech on this MPI, I note he used another phrase in describing&mdash;or misdescribing it&mdash;our decision: `extraordinarily bad policy with extremely serious consequences'. As he sat there next to the great bulk of the Leader of the Opposition, that phrase put me in mind of that honourable gentleman. What he could only be describing was what we have christened, and which has had great resonance in the electorate, as Beazley's black hole.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">  But it is my opinion&mdash;and I think it is the opinion of the electorate&mdash;that for the honourable gentleman from Kingsford&hyphen;Smith to describe this decision as causing `enormous damage' is quite ludicrous. In my opinion, it is exaggerated, it is far&hyphen;fetched and it is nonsense. It is quite true, as the minister has pointed out, that there have been representations from the recipient governments which were to benefit under the DIFF scheme, but to describe it as `enormous damage' is, as I say, quite far&hyphen;fetched. Furthermore, in asking this week for members on our side to make apologies, it may be more appropriate for our side of the House to ask your side to deliver us an apology for what the Treasurer (Mr Costello) has described as `the intergenerational theft' of Beazley's black hole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was the opposition when it was in government that so misspent this country's finances that we have a black hole that we are required to fill. It puts me in mind of a bank robber emerging from a bank pleading victimisation and saying that it was the fault of the depositors who put the money in the bank; or, perhaps more appropriate, the firebug who was caught emerging from the blazing factory to say, `Well, it wasn't my <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> fault that the match was lit. It was your fault for putting the building there.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, when you come to ask yourself whether this decision we have made to abolish DIFF will cause the enormous damage to our reputation in this part of the world that the honourable gentleman claimed, you must recall what the Minister for Foreign Affairs said when he pointed out that it is quite false to describe our whole foreign policy in this part of the world as hinging on one aid scheme. He pointed out that the depth of our relationships with the various countries in this region&mdash;in particular, the countries that were to benefit under the DIFF scheme&mdash;is many and varied. It is deep. It goes from the memories of students who have studied in Australia to the memories of individuals in a poor village in a part of China, Vietnam, the Philippines or Indonesia who were the beneficiaries of a more basic delivery, perhaps by an Australian NGO.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You cannot describe validly the abolition of this scheme as somehow destroying our entire reputation in this region. It is quite ludicrous to imagine that the abolition of just one scheme in our entire aid program&mdash;eight per cent of it&mdash;should somehow rend asunder all the goodwill that has built up for Australia in this region in the past 40 years since aid has been flowing. What I would like to ask the House to consider is that our decision to abolish this part of the aid budget, and to save thereby eight per cent, was made as a result of priorities that we determined. When we looked at the entire aid budget and when we looked at the sort of aid that was being delivered, we made a decision in opposition&mdash;and we hold to it in government&mdash;that aid should take on a more humanitarian face.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We pointed this out in the election campaign and in part 18 of the document <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A confident Australia</EMPHASIS> that deals with development aid. There are a number of bullet points there that I would refer honourable members to, the first of which reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> recognition that the primary purpose of foreign aid is assistance in overcoming humanitarian concerns in terms of outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA>The second bullet point reads:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3037">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> an increase in the proportion of aid allocated to humanitarian and poverty reduction purposes.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>Hence, when we looked at the entire aid budget and saw how much of it was locked in by legal commitments under treaties and other such things, we found that there was less discretion than we perhaps had first thought. Hence, when we had to set ourselves a set of priorities, we felt that there was nothing wrong with having the altruism to say that we should concentrate more on the basic aid that I know my friends, the member for Chifley (Mr Price) and the member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson), would prefer rather than leave intact a scheme that provided subsidies to business.</PARA>

Let us look at the sorts of Australian companies this scheme was directed at. In the beginning it went largely to big companies, some subsidiaries in Australia of multinational companies, but lately it is true to say that it was acquiring more of a flavour whereby smaller companies would participate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Simply saying that such smaller companies were to be the beneficiaries of some of these projects illustrates the fact that there are many other small companies in Australia which  were never going to benefit under DIFF or any other scheme that the Commonwealth, or any of the state governments, might provide. So the argument about fairness arises and whether it is fair to single out companies in a specific sector of the Australian economy <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and provide a subsidy scheme for them to participate in spoiled markets&mdash;that is, markets where infrastructure projects are sought after by companies from other countries, as honourable members on the other side pointed out, such as Japan, Germany, France in particular, Finland and some others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our problem in this country is that our real interest rates are far too high. This is a result, in particular, of the great dissaving that happens as a result of a series of large government budget deficits. Hence, a problem of premium risk is put on Australian borrowers when they venture into the world's capital markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, in trying to restore some rectitude to the Commonwealth budget, the aim of this&mdash;which we seem to be achieving a little sooner than we might have otherwise anticipated through red hot competition among banks&mdash;is lower real interest rates. That would deliver a benefit to every borrower within Australia, not simply a few companies whose business, laudable though it is, involves infrastructure projects.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is wrong to say that we walked away from a host of legal obligations. When we looked at the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3038"> companies that had received letters from Gordon Bilney, the previous Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs, as it then was, we found that a number of them had received letters of formal offer and that a lot more had received what are described as letters of advice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was our decision at the time, despite legal advice, and much to my surprise, that we as a Commonwealth government were not legally obliged to fund those companies which had received letters of formal offer because an appropriation by the parliament had not yet been made in respect of those letters. Nonetheless, we decided to fund them. But, in being forced to make savings, we had to draw the line somewhere. We found that it was sensible and logical to draw it in between the letters of advice and the letters of offer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What lies behind this, as I keep pointing out, is fiscal discipline. Budgetary health is a prerequisite for Australia's economic health and for its larger competitiveness in this region. We face problems with high real interest rates, an enormous and persistent current account deficit and a savings ratio that is far too low than is otherwise healthy. We should do what we can to restore fiscal rectitude to the Commonwealth and hence drive those real interest rates down and provide a competitive boost to all borrowers in the economy, not simply to a particular group of companies which sought to pursue their business in infrastructure projects in Asia in what are clearly spoiled markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Spoiled markets are those spoiled by subsidies by other countries, as you know. You pointed out in your speech that nations with very aggressive chequebooks are, to put it bluntly, always in there competing for these projects. Hitherto we have been able to compete, until we found that we did not have the financial resources as a government to make it healthy for us to pursue these projects, as the previous government did. It is quite plain that, in choosing within the aid budget a priority with diminished resources, there is nothing wrong with resorting to altruism, as we have done, and seeking out those projects that have a more basic flavour <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> or, if you consider it in a larger perspective, a more immediate flavour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is no secret that we as a region are potentially threatened by a further spreading of the HIV virus, especially through parts of South-East Asia. The potential is for that virus to spread through Papua New Guinea and into the Pacific. When I was briefed on the dangers of this sort of epidemic spreading further were there not vigorous measures taken to stop it, it struck me as pretty obvious that the taking of those measures was the sort of thing that ought be at the top of the government's aid priorities. That is of a basic flavour and has immediate benefits for Australians who might otherwise be infected. To neglect this virus as a priority in the aid budget and not put more resources into projects to educate people in these regions about it would be quite wrong of us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decision to abolish DIFF has caused, as Mr Downer has pointed out, some complaint among the recipient governments both at working level and at ministerial level. However, from the point of view of an Australian government, trying to remake an aid budget and imbue in it sensible priorities, there is nothing wrong whatsoever with our decision to abolish this facility&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me firstly deal with the enormous damage that has been done as a result of the government's decisions in this area to parliamentary and ministerial standards. There has been enormous damage done to parliamentary and ministerial standards by the conduct of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3039"> the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Andrew Thomson), whom I am pleased to see is in the chamber for this debate today; by the conduct of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer); by the conduct of the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer); and as far as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is concerned, by his absolute and complete failure to enforce any reasonable set of standards of parliamentary and ministerial behaviour. I am disappointed to see the parliamentary secretary leaving the chamber because, in very many respects, a lot of this starts with him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From my perspective, interest in this matter starts on Friday, 14 June when we find in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> `PM damages credibility in Asia: Woolcott'. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister, Mr Howard, has damaged his credibility in Asia by abolishing a concessional credit aid scheme, according to the former head of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr Richard Woolcott. The Federal Government's decision to scrap the Development Import Finance Facility would undermine Australian credibility, offend neighbouring governments and harm Australian competitiveness, according to Mr Woolcott.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the Prime Minister's personal envoy to Malaysia. This is a man whom the Prime Minister holds in highest regard as a foreign policy adviser.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That matter is put to the foreign minister in the course of question time and we find the publicity which follows: `Downer dismisses axed aid criticism'. When those matters were put to the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the House, he dismissed the criticisms of DIFF by Mr Woolcott saying, `He was a consultant to one of the beneficiaries of the concessional credit scheme.' We see the appropriate headline in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> `Howard's envoy decked by Downer'. Mr Woolcott responded to that on 19 June in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> by rejecting it. But matters were made worse by the parliamentary secretary who, on the MPI, on 18 June, when he handled the debate in the absence of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, said in the course of debate:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Let me talk a little more about why we settled on DIFF as what we were going to abolish. Quite <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> plainly, you can sum it up in two words: fiscal discipline.</PARA>
<PARA>So that is the policy rationale. But in the course of the debate, my colleague the member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton) interjected with the question, `What about Richard Woolcott?' The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  then states:</PARA>

<PARA>We find very quickly after that, on 20 June&mdash;Thursday morning&mdash;in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  `Minister orders MP to apologise to Woolcott'. Even the foreign minister had to draw the line somewhere. The story says that this apology will be made in the parliament. The parliamentary secretary told the journo on Wednesday night. When did the parliamentary secretary skulk into this parliament? Did he skulk into this parliament on the Thursday morning when I shared chamber duty with him from 10 o'clock? No, he skulked in at 5.30 in the evening. So he skulks in and gives an apology under instructions from the Minister for Foreign Affairs. In the course of his apology, he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I think the better view is that he could have been more vigorous in making those facts known to me in his letter. However, I do not believe that he acted in a deceptive fashion . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Some apology! No wonder Mr Woolcott, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>  of Tuesday, 25 June, writes as follows about the apology:</PARA>

<PARA>So I give Mr Woolcott the courtesy of reading that into the record so at least he gets something after having been the subject of a blackguarding by the parliamentary secretary. This is not the first occasion on which we have seen the parliamentary secretary&mdash;who has now gone from blackguarding to the bunker&mdash;trying to besmirch public officials or people of high standing in this way. `RBA cleared over insider trading claims'&mdash;this is the same man who alleged that RBA officers were guilty of insider trading. We are pleased to see him go from blackguarding officers to the bunker.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second area of great damage to parliamentary and ministerial standards has been the conduct of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I think this is the killer punch, but it takes a lot of blows to parliamentary and ministerial standards to get this bloke down. In question time on the 18th in response to a question from the member for Kingsford-Smith he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact is that of course some officials who are involved in the details of these programs have raised issues with my department, and you would not expect otherwise. But if this was a serious issue in our relationships they would raise it at the ministerial level. They would be writing me letters.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>This is question time on the 18th. In his statement yesterday he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was made aware before 18 June that a letter would come from Dr Habibie . . .</PARA>
<PARA>So he knew when he came to question time on the 18th, he knew when he said expressly, `They would be writing me letters,' that they <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> were. That is why his misleading of the House ought to see the Prime Minister sack him. If the Prime Minister has any interest in standards, the foreign minister ought to be sacked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The parliamentary secretary has had a role in this. He has been very sheepish and very quiet and has gone back to the bunker. Why? Because we know he was the person who received the Habibie letter. It would be nice if he had stayed in here, rather than skulking away, to answer the question: when did he give it to his minister? On the Tuesday or before? On the 18th or before? Before question time or after question time?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us take the benevolent view and say that the letter arrived subsequently. Maybe it means that the parliamentary secretary just cannot get the mail through. The cartoon in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> was drawn to my attention when I was looking at Mr Woolcott's letter. In addition to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> letter that I have referred to, he wrote also to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>. The cartoon is headed `A letter to Mr Downer'. The person dictating that letter is shown saying: `. . . and, in bold type on the envelope write, "Instructions: 1.) Open 2.) Read".'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even if you take the extraordinarily benevolent view of ministerial standards and misleading the House that the Prime Minister does, the foreign minister has to be sacked on the basis that we are now walking around saying to our regional neighbours and internationally that we have a foreign minister who, if he does read, can't remember or, if he doesn't read, pretends. These are extraordinary standards for the Prime Minister to accept.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third area of enormous damage to ministerial and parliamentary standards is the conduct of the Deputy Prime Minister. When I first raised in this House the issue of DIFF and its implications for trade, he said, `Nothing to do with me.' Yesterday I asked him whether any matters had been raised with him. He said, `Yes. By minor officials, President of the Philippines and the foreign minister on 22 April.' I then asked him:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . did you pass on the detail of those representations to either the Prime Minister or your senior <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3041"> portfolio colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who, you have said twice in this House, has responsibility for DIFF? If so, when? If not, why not?</PARA>
<PARA>He said, `Look at the cables.' He would not tell us the conversations he had had with the foreign minister because he knew that if he said yes he would shop his mate and if he said no people would say, `What sort of trade minister are you?' We have a Deputy Prime Minister who either will not tell the House the conversations he has had alerting the foreign minister to DIFF complaints or takes such an interest in our bilateral and trade matters that he forgets as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I noticed that in his disclosure returns the Deputy Prime Minister did remember that the Philippines President had given him a free helicopter ride. He could remember the free helicopter ride, but he couldn't remember, or he won't tell, whether the representations that had been made by the President were relayed to his parliamentary colleague, who he says is responsible for DIFF.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Deputy Prime Minister stands condemned for that but, more importantly, he sat here for five parliamentary days, from 18 June, knowing that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had misled the House. Did he do anything? Did he draw it to attention? Did he tell the Prime Minister? Or did he sit on his hands? He sat on his hands and he is condemned for that as well. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been quite fascinated in the form of this debate. It is a censure motion when you've actually blown the gaff. Apart from anything else, to have a series of accusations made through censure motions&mdash;first by the shadow minister for foreign affairs, then on Tuesday by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and then on Wednesday by the Leader of the Opposition&mdash;and to finish up with a discussion of a matter of public importance on exactly the same subject on the Thursday, the final scheduled sitting day of this first session of the 38th Parliament, demonstrates that the government really has given the answers that it sought to give at the very beginning of the week, that is, as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Minister <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) have said, there was a non-deliberate misleading of the House and at the earliest possible opportunity the foreign minister came into the House and explained his position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as I can see, the substance of the whole of this affair is more that the Labor Party, having been so ineffectual for the rest of the time, has decided that it really ought to find some issue. The issue having failed, it has now come to us on this final scheduled sitting day and what have we got? We have a matter about `the enormous damage arising from the government's decision to abolish the development import finance facility program'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I want to do&mdash;I think it is important&mdash;is set in place three things. As far as the foreign minister is concerned, whatever the rhetoric, there is no doubt that the Prime Minister and the foreign minister have answered more than satisfactorily the accusations made, not only in this House but also by the media. It is true that when you change any program you are going to get some reaction from other countries. It is on that that I think this debate should have been concentrated today, and I will say a little bit about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Looking across the breadth of Australia's aid program, it has always worried me that we seem to be absolutely committed to our multilateral programs. When it comes to bilateral programs, where I have always felt Australia got so much more benefit, we find it easier, if there is a budget cut or some adjustment to be made, to let those bilateral programs suffer. As to the spread of the bilateral programs and their application, there has always been a problem knowing whether or not we get full value from them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have moved more often than not on the humanitarian aid programs. We certainly have been extraordinarily generous in the way in which, in particular countries, we provide not only project aid but also budget aid. Look at New Guinea for an example. It has always concerned me that that country, in spite of the money we have given them, does not yet seem to be able to address some of the fundamental questions of administration. If you turn further afield, you see that Australia has <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3042"> provided, from governments of either persuasion, a significant contribution towards the wellbeing of individuals. The major emphasis of our bilateral programs has always been on those who are poor and those whose need is greatest. Really that is what this debate this afternoon is about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Should there be, in any analysis of the Australian aid program, a reappraisal which puts the development import finance facility above other elements in the aid concept? As far as the multilateral programs are concerned, I am one of those who still feels very sceptical about whether, through the World Bank, the Asia Development Bank or any other of those multilateral agencies, Australia gets, in full dollar value, a return in terms of its international standing, its trade opportunities and opportunities for services exports of the value it does out of other aspects of its aid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We set up AusAID in its various forms&mdash;AIDAB before it became AusAID&mdash;in order to ensure there could be a proper appraisal of the individual bilateral programs. While we do have an opportunity to get some input in multilateral programs, more often than not, as an inquiry which I was involved in a little while ago resolved, it is up to Australian business to get off its backside and do something about it rather than just the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are going to get more value out of our multilateral programs, Australian business needs to be far more aggressive than it has been. There is something that can be done to get value out of multilateral programs. It is not really satisfactory that, when there is to be a reduction in our overall aid, we decide that we are going to cut only in the field of bilateral aid. I think multilateral programs give us less return more often than the bilateral programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> If you start looking at and analysing what is included in the whole content of that very large sum of money that the Australian taxpayer provides each year to assist the disadvantaged around the world, I cannot say that I believe the development import finance facility should have priority over those programs that are designed specifically to help those countries which are less fortunate, to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> help those who are either poor or totally disadvantaged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trouble is that it is always difficult in major projects, such as most of those within the DIFF concept, to have the tap turned off. As soon as you do so, you know that there has been a pipeline which is fairly extensive and that somebody is going to suffer. It is in that context that there is a certain adverse result in Australia having decided it could not afford to maintain the total content of its aid program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having registered and accepted that, we need to see to the maximum how we can develop our aid program better in the future. While it is not specifically related to this matter of public importance, I think what we need to do at this stage is to look across the breadth of the performance and at where we are going for the future. I hope in the budget of 20 August that there might be consideration given by the government to the total content of both multilateral and bilateral programs. Unless there is, I do not think we are going to get the value that Australia needs for whatever funds we can allocate to aid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In terms of particular country aid, it worries me that in a country so close to us and where there is a particular problem at the moment&mdash;that is, in Papua New Guinea, and in particular in Bougainville&mdash;there are large sums of money available that are not being spent. When that happens one wonders just how we can overcome the disability. Indeed, if you have a look at the crisis in Bougainville, one of the real concerns there is the delivery of aid, not just the provision of funds. Unless we can do something about ensuring that our aid is delivered, it means that no value is generated either for the recipient country or for the donor. Equally, the same applies to aid in other areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part of my worry with the DIFF program has been that the long-term benefit and recognition of Australia's contribution is likely to be minimal. I have been to a number of bridges&mdash;without specifically identifying where they are&mdash;in the eastern provinces of Indonesia. I notice the honourable member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson) is in the House; he was with me at the time. Some of those <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3043"> bridges were constructed by Australia under earlier aid programs, and you would have no idea they were built by Australia. That is part of the problem. Our difficulty is: to what degree do we provide aid to help Australia, or to what degree do we provide aid in order to better the conditions of the countries who receive that aid, and to what degree do we expect in the long term to get some type of return from it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> To my mind the benefits should be, first, in the recognition that Australia has been a generous and willing neighbour; secondly, that we make sure we develop friendship and understanding, which hopefully might add to a better political dialogue; and, thirdly, that we make sure we help to overcome the abject poverty which tragically is apparent in so many other countries and continents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We want to try to do our best internationally to make sure that we are seen as a responsible international citizen. I believe that all those objectives have been achieved in the aid program as it is now composed. But to say, as this MPI suggests, that because we have abolished the DIFF program there has been enormous damage arising from the government's decision is absolute nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been, of course, a rejection of our decision to withdraw the funds by those countries which were going to receive some benefit. I hope that some of these programs might in some way be reincorporated, because I do recognise that infrastructure development is tremendously important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, it was quite interesting the other day to note in an Auditor&hyphen;General's report the trend downwards in infrastructure development within our own country. One of the problems that every country must face is the development of the infrastructure to enable people's living standards to be as high as they possibly can be. But to suggest, as this MPI does, that because we have abolished one element alone of our total aid program there has been enormous damage is absolute rubbish.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said at the commencement, this is a very limp and lame ending to a week where the government has not been under any real criticism from the Labor Party. They have <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> raised three very poor censure motions, which failed abysmally. And what have they done today on the final day of listed sittings? They list a matter of public importance which has no moment and little comment; and, I must admit, most of the contributions by the opposition members I thought were of little relevance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe our aid program over the years has made an enormous contribution to Australia and I have little doubt that, under the coalition government, it will do even more so in the future.</PARA>

<PARA>These amendments, which have been circulated, were debated earlier today in the Main Committee. Today the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  carried an article quoting the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) in a speech he made to this House earlier this week. The article said that a showdown is looming between the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and the minister. In that article there were statements made that the current chairman of the board regarded certain statements made by the minister as defamatory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister said elsewhere earlier today that he wants a cohesive and cooperative relationship with the airline industry. I put to members that that published article in the newspaper today and the statements of the minister show a direct conflict between the minister and the board. That is not a board with which he had anything to do with and an organisation of which he was quite critical during his period in opposition. He admits that he did attack the board in the statement to the House earlier this week. I ask: what is the relationship between him and the board of CASA and does he enjoy the confidence of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the board or does the board have any confidence in the minister?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is vitally important to have people with experience and expertise guiding the fortunes of our airline industry. I think it is essential that the board that regulates the industry be made up of people with exceptional expertise and certainly a background in the aviation industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not accept the argument that we can have people on the board who are consumer advocates, for instance, people who may have a theory about airline efficiency but certainly no qualifications in regard to airline safety. I make no comment on the personality or the integrity of those board members. I do not know them. I do know from reports that Gabi Hollows is a wonderful lady who has contributed enormously to Australian society, but I do not believe she has anything like the qualifications required for this board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Everything I said in my earlier speech in the Main Committee and everything the minister said in his speech in there supports my amendments. I believe that he was winding up to an endorsement of those amendments when he was speaking, such was the rapport between his words and mine in an earlier speech, but he then said that those amendments touch on other statutory bodies. They may do, but I do not see any fear necessary about this particular one. We are not talking about the ABC; we are not talking about any other statutory board; we are talking about the air safety board&mdash;the one that determines the safety of airline operations in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did speak earlier about a crash near my electorate in October 1993 involving two people, one of whom I knew. Those people survived for several days&mdash;at least 48 hours in one case and up to 15 days, I understand, in the other. But for the need of an electronic transmitter locater, a portable one, they may well have survived. CASA has refused to endorse such a locater up until this time. There was some indication from the minister that that may be about to change, but I ask why that was not endorsed as a matter of course far earlier than this.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3046">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister is not satisfied that CASA fully responded to the report into the DC3 crash in Botany Bay in 1994. That again, to my mind, is an indication of the fact that perhaps there are forces dictating to the board, other than the board determining for itself what its reaction to reports might be. Does it have the expertise and is it getting the sort of information it requires? I think the minister has made it patently obvious he wants a new board. I think we should give him that opportunity. It is no good waiting until we review these boards down the track. This is airline safety we are talking about.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In seconding these amendments, I must say that the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) sought this aviation portfolio. That was certainly a courageous decision, because it is a portfolio which is fraught with a lot of trouble. It seems to me that, if the minister is going to accept responsibility, as he must, for the actions of his portfolio, he must be able to have absolute faith in its personnel.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite clear the minister does not have that absolute faith. I know, and it is a matter of record, he sought the resignation of the board. They all agreed, bar the chairman. I think the chairman is to be condemned for that, because I do not think the chairman had any right to refuse that quite reasonable request from the new minister. I think the chairman's action goes very much to the arrogance of the judiciary, which I have been becoming increasingly concerned about. So it is a very simple scenario. It is a very simple equation. The minister is expected to take responsibility for the actions of the board. He cannot be expected to do that if he himself cannot determine who the board is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are seeing here with the decision to extend the board is that, firstly, it is very expensive and, secondly, it is simply a measure put in place to try to give the minister some semblance of confidence in that board. I think it follows absolutely that, if the minister is to take responsibility, he should have the power to appoint the board. To suggest that this goes to other portfolios, firstly, I think is drawing a longbow and, </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA>secondly, I do not see any reason why it should not be, and I can think of other areas where the minister is expected to take responsibility. This responsibility covers matters of life and death in some cases so yes, of course the minister of the day should have that power. So I think this is a very sensible amendment and a very necessary one. We hope that we would get the support of the House in pursuing it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable members for Calare (Mr Andren) and Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) for their sentiments. I appreciate the concerns that they have expressed, and to some degree those sentiments are shared by myself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Calare made the particular point about ELTs, and I would agree with him about that. I think the process of ensuring people are properly equipped in case of an accident in such a way that they can be found quickly is a very important one. A portable ELT, as opposed to a permanently fixed ELT, is certainly a proposition that I believe has a lot of merits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to the incident that the honourable member for Calare referred to where two people died&mdash;one of whom he knew&mdash;the aircraft had a fixed ELT, but the aircraft burnt, as I recall, and the ELT was destroyed in the fire. Those people survived&mdash;one of them survived up to 15 days. Had he had a portable ELT, he could have taken that with him and been located very quickly, and both persons would have survived to this day. So there is a very strong argument for portable ELTs, which I think is one of the main thrusts of the member for Calare's speech.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also refer to the honourable member for Kalgoorlie's comments and thank him very much for some of the sentiments that he expressed there. I take the view that it is important for the minister who is responsible to have a board that reflects the policy of his government and also a board whom he believes are appropriately qualified with sufficient and adequate and appropriate expertise. So I agree with that aspect of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie's comments.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3047">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In regard to the amendments that have been moved, we have been trying to ascertain the first one of those amendments. The first one actually opposes our increase in the size of the board, as I now have determined, and the second aspect of the honourable member for Calare's amendment is in respect of giving the minister the power to dismiss the board effectively without reason. Those are the two aspects of the amendments that the honourable member for Calare has put forward to the House today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite sharing many of the sentiments of both the honourable member for Calare and the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, we will not be supporting those amendments, for reasons that I outlined earlier today in the Main Committee. However, I do thank both honourable gentlemen for their contribution to the debate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition does not oppose the extension of the number of members of the board from five to seven, as is proposed in the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill, and therefore does not support the first amendment that has been moved by the honourable member for Calare (Mr Andren). We also do not support the second amendment moved by the honourable member for Calare. That amendment would, in effect, render meaningless the whole basis of statutory authorities and the boards which govern those authorities, because they are intended to be at arms length from the day-to-day political process and not subject to direct ministerial whim, otherwise the authority might as well be part of the department.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment that has been moved by the honourable member for Calare would, in effect, put the minister in a position whereby the board could be subject to instant dismissal for no reason and, therefore, might just as well be part of the department. In fact, it would probably put the board in a more vulnerable position than that which it would be in if it were part of the department. It would also raise some big question marks about how these matters would be dealt with in other statutory authorities, both within the portfolio of the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) and in other areas.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have two very quick comments to make with respect to the matters that have been raised. The first relates to ELTs. Yes, the opposition accepts that, in certain circumstances, hand&hyphen;held ELTs will perform a life&hyphen;saving function which fixed ELTs will not perform. But the opposition would say that the reverse is also true: there are certain circumstances in which a fixed ELT may assist in saving lives whereas a hand&hyphen;held ELT may not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said in debate here a day or two ago, I hope very sincerely, for the minister's sake, that we do not have a situation arise after this ordinance is gazetted where the reverse situation to that which the honourable member for Calare adverted to in his speech occurs and people die as a result of not having a fixed ELT in a plane that goes down in a remote area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition believes that it is inappropriate for the minister to intervene directly and to countermand the position of his authority on this issue. Evidence has come to my attention only today that the technical officers in CASA have recommended very strongly that the organisation should stick with its position with respect to the fixed ELTs regulation and not switch to allowing hand&hyphen;held ELTs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second matter I wish to refer to is the extraordinary behaviour of the minister in relation to the CASA board. He now appears to be engaging in warfare by press release with the chairperson of the board. Irrespective of his views on the behaviour of the board and what may or may not be occurring, it is extraordinary that, as a minister of the Crown, he is choosing to pursue these issues by press release. One would have thought that, if he did have these concerns, he would be able to pursue them through proper ministerial channels. He is no longer the shadow minister; he is now the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is remarkable that he seeks to pursue this vendetta by press release. It does the organisation no good. It does confidence in the administration of aviation safety in this country no good. Finally, I question what evidence he has of any wrongdoing, any misbehaviour, any maladministration or any <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3048"> incompetence on the part of the existing board. So far we have heard no evidence.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to add a few points to those which I raised earlier. I was earlier too busily engaged in conversation with the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell). As to the amendment moved by the opposition, we both wish our names to be recorded in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  as wishing to have voted on the other side. We certainly were not supportive of that amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to a couple of points that have been raised by the opposition. Despite the fact that they claim that there should be no right of the minister to dismiss a board, I point out again that a situation has arisen between the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) and this board which certainly does nothing to give anybody travelling by air any feeling of security. While ever we are engaged in this slanging match&mdash;and there must be residual bitterness involved&mdash;it must impede any sound judgment on just what is and is not delivered to the minister, what advice is accepted from the staff of CASA and how effective the whole operation is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People have mentioned that Dick Smith is wanting to get back on to this board. I have no truck with anybody who has been suggested as a potential board member. I doubt that the minister has. His stance is to get a board that he believes in, that has got the confidence of the industry. I am arguing from the point of view of that industry and from the point of view of local operators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I firmly believe that I am not carrying the bag for anyone. This is an issue that goes deep to my electorate's industry and it goes deep to my personal experiences. I am certainly not here as a lackey for anyone in moving these amendments. I was convinced of their necessity, and that is why I am here.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to refer to some of the comments made by the opposition spokesman, the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), in regard to the so-called press release war that he alleges is occurring between the Chairman of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and me. I make the point&mdash;he would be well aware of this&mdash;that I made a ministerial statement in the House on Tuesday afternoon, which is a most appropriate thing for a minister to do. It is something that dropped off during the last few years of the previous Labor government. They were the sorts of people who, rather than make an appropriate statement in the House, would actually put out press releases.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was making a ministerial statement following the Monarch coronial inquiry&mdash;the final presentation of that report. As did the coroner in the Monarch case, I made criticisms of the old CAA&mdash;I referred those criticisms to the new body, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority&mdash;and I made criticisms of the current CASA. Justice Fisher, who was the Chairman of CASA, decided off his own bat to put out a press release yesterday afternoon criticising me for criticising CASA. He said it was almost defamatory of me to make those sorts of criticisms. I make the point that I, as the minister, take the responsibility for what goes on in aviation safety in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that, in order to fulfil that task properly, I need at times to pass on criticisms, to make criticisms, and also to give praise where it is due. For the Chairman of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority to say that I do not have the right to make criticisms of CASA is a serious misjudgment on his behalf. I will continue to make criticisms where I believe they are appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would make the point, as I did in the Main Committee earlier today, that his press release&mdash;which is not the first such press release he has chosen to put out&mdash;contradicts totally the letter he wrote to me in April this year, which said that he would give me complete loyalty and give the government <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3049"> loyalty. He used this expression of loyalty as justification for his continuing in his role as chairman of that organisation. I would put the proposition to members of the House that the two press releases he has issued since would be a long way away from expressions of loyalty to the minister and the government.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just very briefly: the minister is being too cute by half. The matter which caused the chairperson of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority to put out a media statement was the minister's assertion in his ministerial statement that he&mdash;that is the chairperson&mdash;and his fellow board members were placing their own interests ahead of the interests of aviation safety in Australia by refusing to resign. That was the accusation which he described as being almost defamatory; that was the thing which provoked his response. It is pretty extraordinary that the minister is demanding or asking for loyalty on the part of somebody against whom he has made such an accusation and where that accusation has not been substantiated in any way, shape or form.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I think your warning is very sound. The member who has just spoken, the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), makes an absolute case for giving the minister power to remove the board. It is quite clear there is no confidence there. This board is going to lurch from crisis to crisis. It is much better that this amendment be adopted. My colleague the member for Calare (Mr Andren) and I both feel strongly about this. This is the only way that this matter is going to be resolved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a view that people who fly in aeroplanes are no more entitled to safety than people who drive motor cars or travel in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> buses. We have to look very much at affordable safety in the air. I believe that civil aviation regulations should not put anything like as much pressure as they do on owner pilots or people flying with their families. There should be less concern with general aviation charter business&mdash;and I would charter more than anyone else in this House. I make no assessment of who is safe and who is not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite clear that these judgments have to be made. It is overwhelmingly clear from what the spokesman for the opposition has said that the minister does have to be in a position to have confidence in that board. Whatever the reason is, that does not exist now. There are going to be ongoing sniping and virtual warfare between the board and the minister. That is not conducive to safety or for legislation to ensure safety. This amendment of ours is very important. The minister should think twice about it and perhaps have a little more intestinal fortitude and not be driven by his department so much.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the fourth annual meeting of the Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum, held in Cha&hyphen;Am, Phetchaburi Province, Kingdom of Thailand from 15 to 18 January 1996. As I have reported previously to this House, the Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum very much had its genesis in the work of members of this House, along with the chairman of that organisation, the very distinguished former Prime Minister of Japan, Mr Nakasone.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was my predecessor as Speaker in this House, the member for Watson, the Hon. Mr Leo McLeay MHR, who was very much involved in originally establishing this organisation. When I was Speaker of the House, and in the course of the last three years, I had taken a very strong interest in ensuring that the Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum achieved what I consider to be some very valuable and reasonable outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This particular meeting was one of significance because it followed on from decisions taken previously, at the behest of Australia, that the actual administration arrangements associated with this forum be put in place and be put on a much stronger footing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think there was a perception when it was originally established that it was simply an opportunity for parliamentarians from the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region to get together and perhaps have a round of golf&mdash;a little bit of golf <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3051"> diplomacy; occasionally that does not go astray. Then they would sit down for a couple of hours, have a yarn and it was all over, red rover. I think that has changed. It has changed dramatically and for the better. Mr Nakasone is to be commended for his drive and initiative in that. The Australian parliamentary delegations that have gone to both the executive committee meetings and, most recently, to the actual forum itself have played a real role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our delegation at this last meeting was led by Ben Humphreys, the former member for Griffith in Queensland. The deputy leader of the delegation was the new Speaker, the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson), and other members of the delegation were Senator Bryant Burns and the member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I record the thanks of our delegation to Mr Peter Gibson, Assistant Secretary (Committees) in the Department of the House of Representatives, who was the delegation secretary and, importantly, to Mr Lyn Barlin, Clerk of the House of Representatives and Bronwyn Allan, the Executive Officer of the Australian National Group of the Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum. I also thank our diplomatic representatives in Thailand, particularly Cavan Hogue, the Ambassador, and Antoinette Merrillees, the Second Secretary. All those people played a very real and pivotal role in ensuring the success of this delegation. I was delighted that the now Speaker was able to accompany us on that delegation, because it gave him an insight into the way in which this forum operates. I would hope it will have his support for the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issues which were discussed in our meeting in Cha&hyphen;Am went to some very important issues, and a communique was issued at the conclusion of the conference. We talked about the political and security issues that continue to face the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region, and a number of delegations took the opportunity in the forum to talk about the South China sea matter. There was a great deal of discussion about anti&hyphen;nuclear issues, because members will recall that, at the time, the French were still conducting tests in the Pacific Ocean. There was some real concern about <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> expressing views about that in the conference. We also talked about regional cooperation in the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region and a number of other issues, including terrorism, drug abuse, trafficking, money laundering, the protection of children and children's rights, the protection of women's rights, AIDS, cooperation and the sharing of natural resources. All these issues were covered in a very reasoned and reasonable way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is all well and good for larger countries in the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region and those that have well advanced forms of parliamentary democracy to, perhaps, occasionally sit back and consider that they are the only ones that should participate in forums of this nature&mdash;that they, in some way, have a mortgage on all the wisdom that goes into forums of this nature. That is certainly not the case with the APPF. One of the great benefits on this occasion was the fact that representatives at a very senior level from smaller nations&mdash;some 25 or 26 of them now make up the APPF&mdash;took the chance to speak. That, in itself, was one of the more pleasing features of the forum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I made passing reference to the fact that some very distinguished members of various parliaments participated. At the time, I was a member of the executive committee and I held the position of Speaker of the House of Representatives. But I think it is important to note that we had a number of other speakers or deputy speakers from various parliaments as leaders of their delegations. There was a very large representation from the Thai parliament itself. At this stage, I extend to the Thai parliament the congratulations of Australia for their organisational abilities, as expressed in the forum. It really was an outstanding success in charm. It was an outstanding success because of the way in which members and staff of the Thai parliament went out of their way to ensure that all the delegations were well looked after and that the forum ran very smoothly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was more than a talkfest, and I think there were some valuable outcomes. The particular communique that was adopted has, in fact, been sent to the United Nations and all the host parliaments. When the next of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3052"> these meetings rings around, there will be a report&hyphen;back mechanism from the parliaments to see how the resolutions adopted in Cha&hyphen;Am have been adopted by a number of parliaments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank all the people who, in the last three years when I had the opportunity to be the chair of the Australian National Group of the APPF, contributed so much to its growth and its importance in our region. I said at the time that I had the belief that the APPF had the potential to be one of the premier parliamentary forums in the world. There is the IPU and there is the CPA, and now there is the APPF. Given that the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region is the fastest growing economically, given our engagement in the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region, which was, I guess, brought home very passionately and clearly by the former government and which, I am pleased to see, is being embraced by the new government&mdash;given all those reasons, I think that this parliament deserves to continue to press on with the very pivotal role it plays in the APPF. I would hope that at some stage in the future I can continue to play a role within it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the report to all honourable members. I thank the new Speaker for his interest in the APPF. I know he will maintain that interest. I know that he will play a very real role in ensuring that Australia's views continue to be heard in this forum and that we continue the process of encouragement to some of our smaller neighbours not only to go to this forum but also to play a real role by contributing papers and speaking at the forum itself. I thank honourable members for giving me the opportunity to table this report.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>It is just over four years since the High Court delivered its historic judgment in Mabo v. Queensland (No. 2). That case decided for the first time that indigenous Australians have native title rights in relation to land that are recognised by the common law. The judgment challenged our legal and parliamentary systems to provide a framework to protect and respect those rights, while at the same time providing certainty for all Australians and enabling economic development to proceed.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The Native Title Act</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1993 the coalition took the view that the Native Title Bill was inadequate to address the uncertainties following the High Court's decision. But we did not, and do not, reject the Mabo judgment and its principles. We support the principles of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. We believe that a national approach, involving the Commonwealth, the states and the territories, is the only way to address native title issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is now apparent that the Native Title Act 1993 has failed to deliver some key outcomes. The processes of the act have not as yet led to the identification of native title. The act has placed an undue burden on resource development, without significant benefit to indigenous peoples.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Debate interrupted; adjournment proposed and negatived.</PARA>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7V5">Mr WILLIAMS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Despite the passage of the Native Title Act, those whose interests are potentially affected by native title have continued to live with uncertainty. To date there has been little opportunity for judicial guidance as to the nature of native title on mainland Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also uncertain which government acts have extinguished native title, perhaps most importantly in the case of pastoral leases. It appears that it will continue to take some time for legal precedents to be generated in this new area of law.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3054">
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Impact of judicial review</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Judicial consideration to date has tended to focus on procedural issues, rather than the fundamental issues of the incidents of native title and the effect of government actions on those rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1995 High Court decision in Brandy v. Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission held invalid some determinative functions of the commission. The judgment suggests that some determinative functions which were intended to be carried out by the National Native Title Tribunal should now be carried out by the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recent High Court decision in North Ganalanja Aboriginal Corporation v. Queensland in relation to the Waanyi claim, and the earlier decision of the Federal Court in Western Australia v. Lane in the Miriuwung Gajerrong claim, have demonstrated that the process for deciding whether native title claims should be accepted and registered is not operating effectively. The statutory benefit of the right to negotiate flows from the registration of a claim under the act. Following the Waanyi decision, the Native Title Registrar has been obliged to accept claims for determination even where they appear to have little merit, so long as they are `fairly arguable'. In practice, this means that any claim which raises an issue which has not been definitively settled can be accepted, even if it is most unlikely to succeed. In this government's view, the current law does not appropriately balance the interests of all parties involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The lack of precedent on substantive native title issues has had an impact on the mediation processes established by the act for handling claims. Parties have been unwilling to agree on an outcome when, in the absence of judicial authority, there is little clarity as to their legal rights. This has meant that the negotiation and mediation processes have not produced agreements in the way it was hoped. The lack of outcomes has produced frustration among both indigenous and non&hyphen;indigenous people. To some extent this has been exacerbated by a lack of guidance in the act itself as to the purpose and scope of mediation. There <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> has also been some confusion in the minds of the participants about the role of the National Native Title Tribunal and unrealistic expectations about what the tribunal can achieve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Notwithstanding these difficulties, the government recognises the significant work of the members of the National Native Title Tribunal to date. As well as fulfilling its formal roles, the tribunal has sought to increase public understanding about native title processes.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Principles for amending the act</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We promised in our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs policy that we would:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> retain the Native Title Act;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">(b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> reserve the right to amend the Native Title Act to ensure its workability;</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">(d)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> ensure that any amendments to the Native Title Act are preceded by wide consultation.</PARA>
<PARA>I can assure honourable members that we have kept those promises. We have not included provisions in the bill which would allow the legislative extinguishment of any native title which might have survived the grant of a valid pastoral lease. Our decision was explained in the outline paper released in May and entitled `Towards a More Workable Native Title Act'. The government stands by this decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recognising the disappointment both among interested parties and in the broader community about the lack of outcomes from the Native Title Act processes, we have adopted a set of objectives against which the proposed amendments have been measured. These are:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> to reduce the impact of the current uncertainty as to the existence of native title on pastoral leases;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">to improve the management of claims;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> to lessen the adverse impact of the right to negotiate on mineral exploration and mining;   </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3055">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> to streamline the processes for determinations of native title and the right to negotiate in a way that is fair to all parties;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> to ensure the constitutional validity of the determination process and clarify the future role of the National Native Title Tribunal; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> to facilitate greater use of consensual and mediation processes under the Native Title Act.</PARA>
<PARA>The amendments we have formulated in light of these objectives are significant. I am however confident that anyone who is prepared to approach this bill in a fair&hyphen;minded way will conclude that it does not alter the basic philosophy of the Native Title Act.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Why certain measures have been left out of this bill</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government intends to address all the issues considered in the outline paper released in May this year. However, this bill does not contain all of the measures described in that paper as the government's `proposed amendments'. It became obvious early in the consultation process that some proposals would be of much greater interest to, and have a greater impact upon, interest groups than would others. In particular, the right to negotiate provisions and the proposals to impose statutory rights and obligations on representative Aboriginal&hyphen;Torres Strait Islander bodies are the subject of detailed submissions to the government and ongoing consultation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government welcomed the initiative of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation for organising the meetings of key interested parties such as the Minerals Council of Australia, the National Farmers Federation, various land councils, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, and the representatives of a number of representative bodies in establishing working groups to develop proposals in response to the outline paper.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government also welcomes the constructive contribution from the states and territories which must live with the act on a day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day basis and have intricate knowledge of its workings and deficiencies. We welcome the constructive way in which all interested <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> parties have made a contribution to the policy debate, and we anticipate further very useful contributions from them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To include those proposals in the bill would have pre&hyphen;empted consultations on these key issues, and would have left insufficient time for serious consideration of the submissions made in response to the deadline for submissions of 18 June 1996. The government will therefore move amendments to this bill in the budget session to deal with the right to negotiate provisions in the act and with the role and responsibilities of representative bodies. There may well be other issues which emerge during that consultation process which need to be addressed at that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The introduction of the bill at this early stage will give the parliament significant time to consider its provisions in detail. We propose also to refer the bill, together at the appropriate time with the foreshadowed government amendments, to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund for its consideration and report. All parties have had an opportunity to consider the outline paper, and they will of course have the opportunity to consider and fully debate the bill, including the amendments I have mentioned.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Contents of the bill</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now turn to outline the key provisions of the bill. Schedule 1 of the bill contains the substantive amendments to the Native Title Act, and is organised in parts, each dealing with a particular issue.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Application procedures</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments in part 1 of schedule 1 address the constitutional difficulties raised by the Brandy decision and, apart from some departures which I shall refer to, are essentially the same as those included in a bill introduced into the House at the end of 1995 by the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA>They were the subject of extensive consultation at that time. These amendments set up a new system under which native title, compensation and non&hyphen;claimant applications will be filed in the Federal Court. They will then be <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3056"> referred to the National Native Title Tribunal for notification and mediation, where such a reference will assist the parties to come to an agreement about native title. In all cases, however, determination of claims will be by the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Item 39 of schedule 1 will insert a new section 86A into the act to spell out the purposes of mediation in native title cases. We recognise that the lack of relevant judicial precedents at this point means that most mediations are unlikely to produce complete agreement. We believe, however, that agreement on factual matters relating to an application should be possible. Such agreement can be an effective means of shortening Federal Court processes by relieving the court of the need to hear evidence on, and rule on, the facts in each case. The amendments seek to ensure that resources for mediation are used effectively and in those cases most likely to achieve partial or complete agreement.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Registration of claims</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A key aspect of the improved workability of the act is the splitting of the consideration of a claim by the Federal Court from the registration of the claim on the Register of Native Title Claims. Registration will be the pre&hyphen;requisite for native title holders and claimants to access the special right to negotiate in relation to mining and some compulsory acquisitions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Federal Court will determine all claims, whether or not they satisfy the registration test. As all claims will be in the Federal Court, it will be open to any party to seek an order that a claim be struck out and the normal rules and procedures of the court, including the ordering of costs against unsuccessful parties, will apply in native title matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current lack of an effective threshold test for access to the right to negotiate is an issue which must be addressed to maintain a proper balance between the interests of native title holders and the need to ensure that economic development is not unduly impeded. Item 96 in schedule 1 will insert a new section 190A to set out the process for acceptance of a claim for registration and the four conditions which must be met.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Native Title Registrar must be satisfied that prima facie each of the elements of a claim can be made out before it can be registered. The registrar must also be satisfied as to a range of matters which have a bearing on whether a claim has a reasonable prospect of ultimate success. The registrar must take into account information provided by the relevant state or territory government as to whether the land is or was subject to freehold, or residential or commercial leasehold grants, and if it is, the claim will be ineligible for registration. By operation of the transitional provisions in schedule 3, the new test will be applied to claims made on or after today, 27 June 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As claimants will be required to provide greater detail for the purposes of claim registration, the bill will increase by one month the time within which a claimant is able to lodge a claim in response to various processes in the act. These include response to a section 29 notice in relation to a mining proposal, or response to a non&hyphen;claimant application. The new procedure and test will ensure that governments and developers do not have to spend time negotiating with those who have not put forward a well researched and credible claim.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Agreements and non&hyphen;claimant applications</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 21 of the act is amended by part 3 of schedule 1 to deal with the situation where native title holders in relation to whom a determination of native title has been made are parties to a section 21 agreement and there is a later determination that other persons hold native title. The lack of other effective provisions to help parties reach agreements has been a major source of frustration with the act. There has been a corresponding overuse of the essentially adversarial processes of determination under the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well as streamlining the determination and registration provisions, part 4 of schedule 1 will insert a new section 24A to establish a process for governments and resource developers to identify, and enter into agreements with, those who claim native title. Through the same process, a new section 24B will allow future acts where no claims are lodged in response to the notification.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3057">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Native Title Act already allows governments and persons with an interest in an area to make a non&hyphen;claimant application to determine whether native title exists. If there is no response to the non&hyphen;claimant application, governments can validly take action regarding the land, even though native title may be later found to exist there. Part 5 of schedule 1 clarifies and strengthens this process for obtaining `section 24 protection'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Together with the new sections 24A and 24B, the act will provide a greater range of mechanisms for governments and other parties to determine whether native title is claimed in relation to particular land or waters, to act with protection where it is not, and to deal with credible claimants where it is. These amendments address in a very practical way the needs of those who have to make the act work.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Leases</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In part 6 of schedule 1 there are several amendments to clarify the acts that may be done validly in relation to leases, including pastoral leases. The basis on which the Native Title Bill was considered by this parliament was that native title did not survive the valid grant of a lease. This was the view of the High Court expressed in Mabo. Since then, the Commonwealth, and the states and territories, have argued in the courts, most recently in Wik Peoples v. Queensland two weeks ago, that native title does not survive the grant of a valid pastoral lease, whether or not that lease was subject to a reservation allowing access or use by indigenous peoples. As yet, however, there has been no definitive judicial determination of this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The act currently provides that pastoral leases are able to be renewed. These amendments further ensure that governments will be able to renew or re&hyphen;grant such pastoral leases on different terms and to vary them so as to authorise non&hyphen;pastoral activities. This will allow pastoralists to diversify the use to which the land covered by the lease is put, provided it does not stop being used primarily for pastoral uses. The variation of a term pastoral lease into a perpetual pastoral lease will also be permitted. Compensation will be payable <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> by governments for any effect on native title rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some have said that it is unfair that pastoralists and others who have an interest in land have to participate in court processes when a native title claim is made regarding that land. Honourable members should remember that many native title holders are also placed in the position of having to go to court to prove and protect their interests in land, and that they too feel it is unfair that they should have to become involved in such legal proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill contains amendments to ensure that legal assistance to persons other than native title claimants may be provided under section 183 of the act at all stages of proceedings, including before such a person becomes a party and in mediations. The bill also ensures that industry bodies can act as agents for any of their members whose interests may be affected by a claim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Funding of claimants is to be the responsibility of the representative Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander bodies. This is consistent with the recommendation of the review of native title representative bodies conducted for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Schedule 2 of the bill amends the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976. These amendments, which enable the appointment of judicial registrars, may not be necessary if other legislation currently before the parliament containing similar provisions comes into operation before this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These amendments will ensure that the Federal Court will be able to make rules of court delegating to judicial registrars the power of the court to determine parties to native title claims and to deal with unopposed or agreed claims. Because this bill extensively amends the claims process, significant transitional provisions are necessary to deal with matters currently before the tribunal or the court.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is committed to achieving real outcomes from the native title processes. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3058"> Those outcomes should be native title determinations for indigenous peoples where native title continues to exist, certainty for governments and others with interests in land and responsible resource development for the benefit of all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments to the Native Title Act will ensure that the rights of native title holders are respected. Within the context of this new reality, we believe that certainty will be best achieved by ascertaining who holds interests in land or waters, and what acts may be done in those areas. The amendments in this bill are focused on achieving this. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3059"> The proposed amendments to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Act 1992 will ensure that the National Regis tration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals, NRA, is required to comply with the policy directions of the Agricultural and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand. This is in accordance with the principle of the Commonwealth, state and territory governments being equal partners in setting the policy direction of the national registration scheme for agricultural and veterinary chemicals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of the other proposed amendments are collectively concerned with the Department of Primary Industries and Energy's management of chemicals subject to import and export restrictions under international obligations such as the prior informed consent procedures. The obtaining of information about chemical products from the NRA is a factor in that management. The proposed amendments will not place any additional reporting burden on the chemical industry as the necessary information is already required to be provided to the NRA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Provision is also proposed for the NRA to be able to impose a fee for the issuing of certificates of export. Those certificates relate to requests from the chemical industry or importing countries to establish the bona fides of a particular chemical product following evaluation of the product by the NRA. Appeal provisions to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal will be available to aggrieved applicants in the event of the NRA's refusal to issue a certificate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed amendments to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Act 1994 clarify the application of the compensation provisions under part 3 of the code. Those provisions apply when certain information is provided on request to the NRA as part of the review of existing agricultural and veterinary chemicals. The related transitional provisions have also been clarified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also proposed to introduce provisions to streamline the issuing of national notices under the agvet codes. This will enable the NRA to issue one national notice rather than separate notices for each jurisdiction, and represents improved efficiency for the NRA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment to the Fisheries Management Act 1991 will provide that where there <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is an acquisition of property within the meaning of paragraph 31 of section 51 of the constitution, reasonable compensation or compensation as determined by the Federal Court is payable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Farm Household Support Act 1992 is being amended to ensure that the drought relief payment is payable to eligible farmers only within the period specified on the drought exceptional circumstances certificate. This will ensure that drought relief payments are used by eligible farmers to meet their basic living expenses only during those periods of extreme drought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments to reinsert drought relief payment to section 43(1) are to correct previous consequential amendments which erroneously omitted drought relief payment from this section.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of the amendment to the Imported Food Control Act 1992 is to allow persons other than officers of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, AQIS, to be appointed as authorised officers. The amendment will allow quarantine officers of the various state and territory departments of agriculture to be involved in the inspection of food imported into Australia. AQIS anticipates a more effective and efficient service to clients as a consequence of the amendment as it minimises, where possible, the duplication of inspection activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of the amendment of the Quarantine Act 1908 is to provide for a system which allows for the issue of penalty notices, which are better known as on-the-spot fines, to persons alleged to have breached Australia's Quarantine Act or regulations by failing to declare, or intentionally incorrectly declaring, goods of quarantine concern when entering Australia. Initially the system will be operated at all Australia's international airports.</PARA>

<PARA>The bill gives effect to the government's decision, announced in the context of the recent Premiers Conference, to remove the wholesale sales tax exemption currently enjoyed by all levels of government in relation to motor vehicles, and parts for those vehicles, provided wholly or partly for private use as part of remuneration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Affected governments and government bodies will no longer be able to acquire sales tax free cars that are to be used, or made available for use, for private purposes by employees with little or no restriction. For example, cars that are typically made available by governments to senior executive service officers, which those officers are free to use more or less as they please outside working hours, will no longer be able to be acquired free of sales tax by the government employer. This will be the case whether or not those cars are formally provided as part of a salary package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the other hand, cars that are to be used for private purposes infrequently and irregularly, or where the private use is to be restricted to travel between home and the workplace or other travel incidental to the employee's duties, will still be able to be acquired sales tax free.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The bill amends the taxation and superannuation laws in a number of significant respects. These include giving effect to an election promise by the government in respect of fringe benefits tax. It will also relieve uncertainty in the business and taxpaying community regarding several measures outstanding from the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Forgiveness of commercial debt</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will introduce new taxation rules relating to the forgiveness of commercial debt. The new measures are based on provisions introduced by the previous government <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3061"> into the parliament which lapsed when the parliament was prorogued prior to the election. The measures I am introducing today depart in several important respects, however, from those lapsed provisions to take account of public concerns that have been expressed about certain aspects of the lapsed provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed amendments will apply to commercial debts forgiven after today, 27 June 1996, and not from 9 May 1995 which was the proposed commencement date announced by the former government. Under revised transitional arrangements, if forgiveness occurs after 27 June 1996 pursuant to an agreement or arrangement entered into on or before 27 June the forgiveness will not be affected by the amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The commercial debt forgiveness provisions will not affect the creditor's taxation entitlements. However, the total amount of debt forgiven in a year of income will be applied to reduce the debtor's entitlement to accumulated deductible losses and other amounts that would otherwise be taken into account in the future in calculating the debtor's taxable income. In certain circumstances, the net forgiven amount of a debtor which is a company will be apportioned among a group of companies related to the debtor company. The measures incorporate rules relating to the forgiveness of debts by a company forming part of a company group. Such provisions, which are anti&hyphen;avoidance in nature, were foreshadowed but not introduced by the former government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The forgiveness of commercial debt measures will correct a structural weakness in the present law which does not properly tax the economic benefit to a taxpayer from being forgiven a debt. The present law creates scope for duplication of deductions in circumstances where the creditor would be entitled to tax relief for a loss on a debt that is forgiven or otherwise settled for less than full value.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Notwithstanding that the act of forgiveness relieves the debtor of the economic loss represented by the debt, tax losses that accumulated before the debt was terminated generally remain available to shield future income from taxation. On occasions, accumulated losses of a corporate debtor have been used <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to absorb future income after being acquired by new shareholders under arrangements that include the forgiveness of pre&hyphen;existing debts. The estimated gain to revenue from the proposed amendments is $20 million in 1997&hyphen;98, $40 million in 1998&hyphen;99 rising to $130 million by 2003&hyphen;04.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since 1 July 1988, when the income of superannuation funds and ADFs became taxable, a complying superannuation entity is unable to claim a deduction for expenses that relate to an investment in a pooled superannuation trust, life insurance company or registered organisation. The entity's ability to claim a deduction for expenses incurred as a result of investing in a PST or life policy is limited by the fact that any amount received upon redemption of units in a PST or surrender of a life policy is treated as tax exempt income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By contrast, if a superannuation entity had made a direct investment in a product which was taxable in its hands, it would be allowed a full deduction for its general management expenses.

<PARA>The bill will provide legislative authority for the entry into effect of an agreement negotiated between the Australian Commerce and Industry Office, ACIO, and the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office, TECO, which was signed on 29 May 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will insert the text of the agreement into the International Tax Agreements Act 1953. The bill will also make consequential amendments to that act, the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and the Taxation (Interest on Overpayments and Early Payments) Act 1983. The consequential amendments to the International Tax Agreements Act 1953 will provide for certain source rules necessary in Australia for the operation of the agreement and for the amendment of previous assessments as a consequence of provisions of the agreement having, or being capable of having, retrospective effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The consequential amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and the Taxation (Interest on Overpayments and Early Payments) Act 1983 reflect the fact that the agreement is between trade offices and that, as such, the agreement would not fall within some of the current definitions of `agreement' and `double tax agreement' in those acts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian government has decided to give effect to the undertakings made by the ACIO in the agreement and does so on the understanding that the TECO has received assurances from appropriate authorities of reciprocal tax treatment in Taiwan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The agreement paves the way for greater business dealings between Australia and Taiwan. It will significantly enhance the development of our commercial relationship <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with Taiwan by providing more favourable tax conditions for Australian businesses operating in Taiwan and by freeing up prospects for investment in both directions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has a flourishing economic relationship with Taiwan. The government is committed to encouraging this relationship to grow still stronger in the future. Taiwan is now our ninth largest trading partner and sixth largest export market. Over the five years to 1994&hyphen;95, merchandise exports grew by 10.5 per cent per annum. Two&hyphen;way trade totalled A$5.9 billion in 1995.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Income of certain organisations promoting trade, investment and cultural exchanges between Australia and Taiwan will also be taxed solely in the territory whose interests the organisation promotes and this may be from a date earlier than the date of entry into effect of the agreement.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the requested amendments be made.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Deputy Speaker, we accept the amendments requested by the Senate. Essentially, what the amendments mean is that this legislation will now pass through the parliament. As we stated right at the beginning, we wanted to change the uplift factor from eight per cent to six per cent. That is the case. We will achieve that. There will be a default uplift factor that remains, but it is now expressed as a formula. This amendment provides for a formula as a basis for setting the default provisional tax uplift factor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The formula is based on ABS published figures for growth in nominal GDP terms. This formula is entirely consistent with the government's election commitment to ensure that the provisional tax uplift factor is set more in line with nominal growth in income. This is the position the government has been putting to the parliament all along, and we are committed to this position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The formula operates by calculating a default uplift factor based on the year average growth in nominal GDP for the year to December preceding the relevant income year. Year average growth in nominal GDP to the December quarter is used as these figures usually become available in March of each year. The default factor will therefore be available to the parliament and taxpayers well before the beginning of the relevant year of income. The formula provides that the default factor will be rounded to the nearest whole number.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The parliament, of course, will still have the opportunity to set the provisional tax uplift factor each year, as currently applies. For example, in March next year the default factor for the 1997&hyphen;98 year of income will be calculated as the percentage change year average growth in nominal GDP in the year to December 1996. For the 1996 income year <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3066"> the formula provides for a default uplift factor of 5.7 per cent, consistent with the factor set by the government of six per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, this government is very supportive of businesses, private enterprise and people who are involved in profit making in this country, and I am sure that businesses will be keen to see this come into effect. I know that the opposition, in previous debates in the parliament today, have indicated that they are not supportive of private enterprise or people who are involved in profit making. We are supportive, as a government, and I am sure that this bill's coming into effect will be most welcome.</PARA></INTERJECT></PROCTEXT>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, it is absolutely absurd for the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) to tell this parliament that this is what the government has been trying to achieve all along. If that is true, Parliamentary Secretary, why did you not legislate it initially? Why has it taken a series of amendments moved by the Australian Labor Party in this place and a series of messages from the Senate for the government to see sense? The truth is, Mr Deputy Speaker, that what the government is doing tonight is correcting another Costello cock&hyphen;up. What it is doing is correcting another failure by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) to implement the election promises which he took to the Australian people on 2 March.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the other place, I think it is fair to say, what the government is trying to do is correct another instance where it has been caught short. Caught short! Senator Short, their bumbling Assistant Treasurer, has mismanaged this legislation from go to whoa. They are, of course, the Laurel and Hardy combination of financial management in this country&mdash;the Assistant Treasurer in the Senate and the Treasurer in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every small business and every self&hyphen;funded retiree in Australia knows the terms of the coalition's election promise, which were to institute an uplift factor on provisional tax of six per cent&mdash;not  six per cent for one year only, but six per cent full stop. The parliamentary secretary is not being completely open with the House when he suggests that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the provision now before us was their intention all along. Their intention initially, Mr Deputy Speaker, was a permanent rate on uplift factor of 10 per cent. That was provided for in the legislation that the parliamentary secretary originally brought before this House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has taken the Australian Labor Party, with the support of the minor parties in the Senate, to keep them honest. It has taken the Australian Labor Party to give them commonsense and some honesty on this measure. What we have tried to say is that a 10 per cent permanent rate&mdash;what the parliamentary secretary calls a default rate&mdash;is not consistent with their election promise, and the parliamentary secretary knows it full well, as does Senator Short. That is why they have had to bring this new provision before the Senate and now before the House. In the other place on 19 June Senator Short said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What we said . . . is having a provisional tax uplift factor regime which sets the uplift factor each year at a level which is more in line with the nominal growth in the economy.</PARA>
<PARA>The nominal growth in the economy for the outyears could not possibly have been 10 per cent, so the coalition has been caught out in an act of deceit, an act of dishonesty, in trying to bring a 10 per cent permanent rate on uplift factor before this House. What they were attempting, of course, was a tax grab whereby they offered a fistful of dollars in year one to the value of $180 million. But then they ripped back $360 million in the following year and another $360 million in the year after that&mdash;a net loss for 800,000 provisional taxpayers in Australia of more than half a billion dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party, happily, through this series of debates, has been able to circumvent the tax grab. We have been able to cut off the hands that were going to grab back, throughout the life of this parliament, more than half a billion dollars from all provisional taxpayers in the nation. It is a happy day for those taxpayers that the government has been kept honest and that it has seen some commonsense on this provision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3067"> But I warn the government that the Labor Party will remain vigilant on these matters, because we recognise that the new calcula tion, the formula that the parliamentary secretary brings before the House, is not perfect. It cannot be perfect because what we are talking about is an uplift projection for the outyears and what he is introducing is a calculation based on data which by its very nature is historical.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we recognise, and put the government on notice, that, as the economic cycle turns down&mdash;as it is bound to under this government with its low growth policies, its upward pressure on interest rates, its fiscal constraint contractionary impact on the macro&hyphen;economy&mdash;the formula that the government is placing before the House will be overstated. The prospective rate and uplift factor that it is bringing forward according to this formula will be overstated. So as it pursues low growth policies we will be vigilant in making sure that provisional taxpayers around Australia are not punished for those policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We recognise that this formula, which provides for an outyear calculation based on nominal growth in GDPI&mdash;GDP measured by the income calculation&mdash;is a lot closer to your election promise than when you started out. It is a lot better than 10 per cent, it is a lot closer to six per cent, and it is to the lasting benefit of those 800,000 provisional taxpayers who this evening I am sure will be thanking the Australian Labor Party for its vigilance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am glad to see the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) in the House and I imagine they will be thanking him, not just for his efforts on this bill but for his efforts over many, many years. He should be congratulated. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a bit rich for the coalition to attempt to justify&mdash;as it has attempted to do in the other place&mdash;suddenly having had a great revelation, and that what they intended, by leaving the matter in a position where from the financial year after this the provisional tax uplift factor would be at 10 per cent, is somehow suddenly not worth the candle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From a former life as a building contractor before I entered this place, I do understand the difference between escalation clauses and rise and fall clauses, and so does the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser) at the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> table. What we have here is an escalation clause. There is no opportunity under this amendment for the provisional tax uplift factor to fall below six per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have the situation where it is all the government's way. I am not sure if the opposition has been snowed on this or understands what we are talking about but, if I understand item 9 on this piece of paper I have before me signed by the Clerk of the Senate, the formula works in such a way that when there is a decline in the GDPI it will have no effect whatsoever. In other words, whilst these provisions remain in force, it cannot go below six per cent. So if the GDPI, as is to be now applied over eight quarters, is to be the catalyst for subsequent adjustments, it only applies in the case of increases. It only applies if that formula gives us a result of more than six per cent, and I understand the rounding&hyphen;off provision. If the formula gives us seven per cent or more, that will be the figure. But if it falls, as it very well could during the life of this parliament, to 4.5 per cent, bad luck. The self&hyphen;funded retirees of this country are not going to get it both ways; they are only going to get it one way&mdash;in the neck.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I have a very serious reservation about what is now proposed, except that it has been agreed to in the Senate and it is better than the proposed 10 per cent after the 1996&hyphen;97 financial year. But, in terms of equity, it has very few feathers to fly with. It is good enough to apply the formula in the case of an increase but not in the case of a decrease. I am sure there are not many reasonable people around Australia or in this room who could understand that. It is inequitable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What they have done is what they have claimed to do, quite rightly and properly, and that is to set a minimum condition. It is a bit like their industrial relations legislation. They have underwritten the figure and it shall be six per cent and no less. It can be more, of course, but no less. I think that is playing with the situation. I do not think it has been canvassed in the Senate. I am not absolutely sure, since I am not an assiduous follower of what goes on there. But it is certainly better than what was proposed, and I accept and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3068"> acknowledge that if this amendment is not passed, the eight per cent figure imposed by the Labor Party, the previous government, will apply. Rather than be accused of depriving unincorporated small businesses and self&hyphen;funded retirees in Australia of the lesser figure, I will go along with it, but I am not fooled by it. I sincerely suggest that the rest of Australia should not be either. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will, Mr Deputy Speaker. The member for Curtin has raised a good point: if the percentage worked out under subsection 3 is negative it is, instead, zero per cent. What he is pointing out is that, if the economy contracts, even if inflation is low and nominal GDP growth is negative, there will be no benefit in this provision for provisional taxpayers. They are going to have an increase in their uplift factor if nominal growth is strong, but if nominal growth is negative it will not cut the other way. They will be penalised for having an uplift factor which does not represent the decline in their small business conditions or the sorts of investment circumstances that self&hyphen;funded retirees would find themselves in.

In fact, the parliamentary secretary was still having the material distributed as he raised the debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is of critical interest to 800,000 provisional taxpayers around the country. Maybe there should be greater parliamentary scrutiny than just having this circulated in one moment and voted on in the next. I ask the parliamentary secretary to consider the virtues of a clause&hyphen;by&hyphen;clause examination, particularly with regard to subsection 9. I think common sense and fairness dictate that, if nominal GDP growth is high, the uplift factor should move up. If it is negative, it moves down. It may need to be negative, particularly in light of my earlier comments about the concern I have about this government's macro&hyphen;economic management. If growth is going to collapse in the future, subsection 9 will be of grave concern to self&hyphen;funded retirees and small businesses throughout the nation. I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We agree to these amendments because they substantially give effect to the second reading amendment that we moved in this chamber that was defeated by the government. We are very pleased that the government has seen the merit of our arguments, not the least of which was that what it was proposing was effectively to introduce a consumption tax by the back door. We argued that this was contrary to any election promise and that whatever was considered dreadful policy for business should not end up as good policy for consumers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government generally has tried to argue that what it was doing was not introducing a tax. It is very interesting that this comes back to us as a message from the Senate, and the reason it comes as a message from the Senate is because the Senate cannot amend a tax bill. They have obviously considered it a tax bill. I think the only person of integrity on the government's side has been the minister now at the table, the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore), who has at least had the decency to acknowledge, in closing the second reading debate last week, that this in fact was a tax. We cannot get that out of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) because he still <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3071"> insists it is a tariff, but the reality is that it is a tax. The High Court says it is a tax, the Senate says it is a tax, the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism says it is a tax. Everyone knows it is a tax, but the Treasurer tries to pretend that it is not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effect of this provision, had it not come back in this form, would have been to see a minimum 2,600 items attract this new consumer tax. We know that because, though it was like extracting teeth, we got at least a response in the Senate to the detailed list of items that would attract this consumer tax. I think the fact that there was a recognition that this would have far&hyphen;reaching consequences is part of the reason why we have been successful in ensuring that consumers are protected from this tax measure. So we do claim credit for the fact that we have been able to protect those consumers and we appreciate the fact that the government has now seen fit to drop off or desist from its original intent, which was to extend this tax to consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said at the outset that these amendments go a significant way towards what we moved in the House in the second reading. They do not completely go there; the other thing that we wanted them to do in terms of coming back with the redrafted bill was not just to protect consumers but to ensure that through the policy by&hyphen;law mechanism there was still a capacity for industry to get, in effect, a zero rating. We always argued, when we were the government and when we announced our measures, that the safety net should still be in existence through the policy by&hyphen;law. The government's original intent was to have the policy by&hyphen;law also attract the three per cent rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These amendments restore the zero rating for a number of areas, essentially capital equipment for use in agriculture, food processing and the food packaging industries. They do not, however, restore the zero rating for a number of manufactured items, in particular, categories 55, 57 and 60 under the particular legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are still persisting with the view that they should be protected. Manufacturing industry in this country still needs the option of getting assistance&mdash;getting options for the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> zero rating&mdash;if they can prove their case. While we welcome these amendments, we still say that they do not go far enough and we will see what happens in the other place when the matter is returned. So far as these amendments are concerned, we welcome them, they represent what we put in the House and we thank the government for it. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The members responsible are now discussing the matter behind the chair, so it is probably difficult for me to say very much more except that this is a very important bill. Obviously, we would not want to expedite its proceeding beyond the reasonable level that any of us can expect is necessary for preparation of speakers to discuss it. That is basically what we are trying to argue here this evening. There has been some agreement and our members are ready. I presume that the minister, in introducing it, believes his are, and, of course, we will have no objection. But until the matter is resolved perhaps it is important for us to reserve our right to object to this particular course of action.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was ready to discuss the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill 1996 which is listed in the order of proceedings for the day and which has already been deferred and delayed by some time. We have a large number of speakers, some seven hours worth of them, waiting to discuss it, so it would be untoward if we were to see that as less important than the bill that is now before us. After the announcement today of the state of the environment report, unless there is some very good reason indeed why this bill should take precedence, we would certainly be arguing that it should be delayed until such time as the ordinary business of the House has been concluded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I stand here, effectively taking time, I am not certain of what status attaches to this bill. But I do know that this bill is one of great importance to us. We spent a great deal of time in government ensuring that we had a bill and a series of amendments over time that ensured the self&hyphen;determination of the Aboriginal people. And it is not without moment that this legislation is objected to by a great many people, not only in the Aboriginal community but in the wider community who, as I understand it, see the contents of the bill as controversial and not likely to have <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> any necessary agreement&mdash;not just by ourselves, but by other parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those reasons, it is important that we really do look at it closely. We are having discussions here and it is important that they be concluded. But as somebody who  formerly, as minister for aboriginal affairs, spent a lot of time and energy looking at these issues, I know how critical it is that this be given due consideration. If our shadow minister has not been given due notice, if the House has not been given due notice, we regard this as a usurpation of the forms of the House. Normally, all those ministers who have carriage of bills would be required to notify shadow ministers that they intend to deal with the matter as a matter of urgent business and that they intend to set aside the orders of the day that have been circulated amongst members&mdash;and they would give very good reasons indeed for seeking to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That clearly has not happened. I have been in here for the last hour or so and I have not heard any argument to the effect that this is something that should take precedence over the existing orders of the day. It is a matter that will deserve a lot of attention and debate, and it will require a lot of the time of the House. But why it should be now, as opposed to later this evening, tomorrow or, indeed, when the parliament resumes after the break is very difficult for members on this side to determine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The very important point needs to be made that there are procedures and that we do predicate our behaviour on the basis of those procedures. And if they are to be overturned, very good reasons indeed must be given. It is not reasonable in conducting the business of this House, or any other, to say to members on this side of the House&mdash;or your side, for that matter&mdash;that there will be an arbitrary determination made on the run about which bill should be dealt with and in what order. All of us have other matters to attend to and it is just fortunate the shadow minister, obviously watching the proceedings here intently, was able to come into this chamber very quickly.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Deputy Manager of Opposition Business I have to say that we have a significant problem with this issue. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill is an important bill that needs a fair amount of discussion in this parliament. I think the government have some amendments that they want to make. We were not aware that this bill was going to be brought on now and that it was going to be debated forthwith. There does not seem to have been the sort of consultation that there should have been between the government and the shadow minister on the matter. The shadow minister has a number of people who wish to speak on this bill, but they were expecting that it was going to come on at a later time tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also the issue of the sitting hours of the House tonight. There seems to be some confusion about where that is going to go as well. The idea that we should have a guillotine on this where we set 10.30 p.m. as the time to finish, whether we have got the business that the opposition wishes to speak to through or not, seems to us to be rather draconian. I do not wish to be terribly critical of the government about this, because that probably would not be appropriate as we get to the end of the session&mdash;though if the failed former finance spokesman wants to encourage me to be critical of the government I am more than willing to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the sense of reasonableness and wanting to see this very important issue debated in this place to the satisfaction of both sides, I think that the government should have been willing to give both more time and more notice to the shadow minister for Aboriginal Affairs. He has pursued this bill through the parliament and has a number of matters that he and other speakers on this side wish to address in relation to this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have got to the end of the sittings and the government still does not know where they want to go with this. They are talking <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> about the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996, which they seem to have lost in the void of the Senate at present.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is 7 o'clock on a Thursday evening, by which time the House would normally have gone home. Instead we are here talking about sitting on Friday, sitting until 9 o'clock, 10 o'clock or goodness knows what time tonight. We have already seen the government lose control of its program to the extent that not only have they brought in these new sitting hours where we were going to sit until 11 o'clock two nights a week, but we have sat until 11 o'clock every night of the week for the past few weeks. That has obviously taken its toll on the government because that is why they have not been able to get their act together now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From our point of view, this is not satisfactory. From the shadow minister's point of view, it is most unsatisfactory. From the point of view of the parliament as a whole, if this is the way we are going to be doing business on the run at the end of the sittings, it does not make for good  legislation or good consideration. It makes for bad law, particularly when we are dealing with a contentious matter such as this issue in relation to the Aboriginal affairs portfolio.

He has left the coun try. Fortunately for him and unfortunately for Australia he has probably left to confuse people in other parts of the world. The last thing he wants is to be here tomorrow just in case the government should cave into respectability and have question time. He would certainly die on the hook tomorrow. The minister and all the rest of them have left the country. They are not willing to do the job that they are paid for.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition is opposed to this motion. This is an absolute disgrace. The government and the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) are treating the House of Representatives and the Senate with contempt. We have seen the introduction of a bill into this House that has been considered by the Senate and amended in the Senate. We were awaiting this bill and a message from the Senate in relation to this bill. What do we get instead? A disregard of what went on in the Senate for the last two days. The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) has just been censured in the Senate&mdash;34 votes to 31&mdash;for  incompetence, amongst other things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We in the opposition were expecting this bill from the Senate with successful amendments that the Senate had passed. What happens? Without notice we get dropped on us in the House of Representatives a fresh bill, starting from scratch. We got no notice. No opportunity has been given for the opposition to move amendments in the consideration in detail stage or in the second and third reading stages of the bill. We have had none of that. We on this side were expecting to debate what the Senate has been considering for the last two days. They have shown us no courtesy. This is from a leader of the House and a government that say they want to raise the standards. It is an absolute disgrace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the House is out of control&mdash;not showing even the simplest of courtesies.

The Leader of the House is being too smart by half. In the six short years that I have been in this place I have never seen the House of Representatives treated with such contempt.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We in the opposition find the treatment of the House of Representatives in the matter of the introduction of this bill a disgrace. The Leader of the House should withdraw this. We should be considering, as a matter of courtesy, what went on in the Senate. We as an opposition should be allowed the  opportunity. We gave an exemption from the cut-off for this bill. The government came to us and said, `We want this discussed as a matter of urgency. Will you give us an exemption in the Senate?' We said, `Yes, we will.' Why? Because there are ATSIC elections in October. You are treating indigenous people with contempt in this place. You are treating the House of Representatives with contempt. You are treating the Senate with contempt.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That this bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>A bill was introduced in the Senate on 23 June 1996 and considered by the Senate on 25 and 26 June 1996. The bill was amended by the Senate. The key amendments by the Senate were to remove provisions which would enable the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs to appoint an administrator to administer ATSIC's affairs in certain circumstances; reduce the size of ATSIC's regional councils; and, provide for the appointment of the commission chairman by the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government cannot accept these amendments. As a consequence, the government has decided to introduce a new bill in the House of Representatives in identical terms to that introduced in the Senate on 23 June 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill proposes certain amendments affecting the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, commonly referred to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> as ATSIC, and to the structure and operating arrangements for regional councils established under the ATSIC Act. The most significant amendments provide for a reduction in the size of regional councils; selection and appointment of the chairman of the commission by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs; improved accountability arrangements for regional councils; and, an appointment of an administrator to manage the operations of ATSIC if the administration of public money by ATSIC has been fraudulent or has involved gross mismanagement, or if ATSIC has intentionally failed to comply with a general direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When ATSIC came into being, a little over six years ago, it was recognised as representing a unique experiment in public administration. Nothing like it had been tried before in Australia or overseas. A review by ATSIC of the operation of the ATSIC Act was completed in early 1993, and a number of significant recommendations for change were made as a result of that review. Amongst those recommendations were recommendations for a reduction in the number of regional councils and for the commission chairman to be elected by the zone commissioners, rather than being chosen by the minister. The recommendation to reduce the number of regional councils was aimed at increasing management efficiency and enabling better servicing and resourcing of regional councils.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recommendation to provide for an elected commission chairman was based on the notion that this would be consistent with the principles of empowerment, self&hyphen;determination and self-management, which were the basis for ATSIC's establishment. Nevertheless, the commission's report containing this recommendation did acknowledge that the question of appointment of the commission chairman was a complex issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report expressed that, in many ways, the chairman is the primary link and source of day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day advice between the commission and the government. It went on to say that the chairman must be a person in whom the government may have total confidence, at the same time as having the confidence and trust <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3077"> of, and the ability to represent, all of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former government accepted both the recommendations for amendment to the ATSIC Act at that time. Consequently, a 1993 amendment to the ATSIC Act provided for a reduction in the number of regional councils from 60 to 36. The reduction in the number of regional councils took effect for the round of regional council elections conducted on 4 December 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1993 amendment to the ATSIC Act also included amendments which provided for a fully elected board of 17 ATSIC commissioners, with the members of that board to elect one of their number to be commission chairman. However, these amendments were expressed to be effective from 1 July 1996 and were therefore intended to affect arrangements for the next board of commissioners following the next round of regional council elections due to be held later this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following completion of the 1993 round of ATSIC regional council elections and the subsequent zone elections, an independent panel was convened under section 141 of the ATSIC Act to review ATSIC's boundaries and electoral systems. The review panel conducted consultation meetings in 20 locations throughout the country. Its report to the former minister on its review of electoral systems was completed in March 1995 and was tabled in the House of Representatives on 11 May 1995 and in the Senate on 30 May 1995. One of the recommendations of the review panel was that the size of regional councils be reduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently, the number of members on a regional council is dependent on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population of the region, and ranges from a low of 10 for regions with an estimated population of fewer than 1,000 people, to a high of 20 for regions with an estimated population of 10,000 or more. The review panel proposed that the act be amended to provide for regional councils to comprise eight members for regions of fewer than 1,000 people, increasing to a maximum of 12 members for regions with a population exceeding 10,000 people.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The initiative was seen as one which would facilitate more effective and efficient operations by regional councils. In essence, it was the view of the review panel that the larger a regional council is, beyond an optimum size, the more unwieldy it is and the less effective it is in the performance of its function.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The review panel's report included advice of concerns that: under current arrangements, decision making processes are unnecessarily protracted due to the size of the regional councils; in some cases, councillors, who are often elected with minimal community support, have little interest or make little contribution to regional council operations; and administrative expenditure associated with the operation of regional councils, including travelling allowances and fees for members, should be kept to the minimum level necessary so that the money available to address community needs can be maximised. The government accepts the recommendation of the review panel to reduce the size of regional councils and the basis for this recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed amendment will contribute to greater efficiency in regional council operations and reduced administrative costs associated with the operation of regional councils. It will also help to ensure that the membership on regional councils is gained on the basis of a more appropriate level of community support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regarding selection of a commission chairman, the government acknowledges the importance of democratic principles in assisting the achievement of greater self&hyphen;management and independent decision making. However, the government maintains that it must retain an appropriate degree of control and accountability where large amounts of government funds are being administered. This is basically because we operate in a system of Westminster government and there is nothing like ATSIC anywhere else in the Westminster system. In the end, it is the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs who is accountable before the parliament. Selection of a commission chairman by government is central to the achievement of this objective.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3078">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently, the board of commissioners comprises 17 elected commissioners and two commissioners chosen by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. The minister is required to appoint one of the 19 commissioners to be commission chairman. The amendment proposed in this bill would have the effect of retaining the current arrangements so that, following the next round of zone elections, the 17 elected commissioners would not elect one of their number to be commission chairman. Rather, a further two commissioners would be appointed by the minister, who would then appoint one of the 19 commissioners to be commission chairman.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another significant area addressed by the bill is the improvement of accountability arrangements for regional councils. In the interest of greater public accountability, the bill includes amendments to make regional council meetings open to the public and to give the public an entitlement to inspect a range of regional council documents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the proposed amendments, regional council meetings will generally be open to the public but will be able to be closed in certain circumstances, similar to those in which local government meetings can be closed. Such circumstances include where commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence and personal privacy issues are being discussed, and where it is necessary to deal with disruptive conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Additionally, the public will have an entitlement to inspect regional council codes of conduct, written procedures for meetings, management plans, written policy documents relating to the payment of expenses and provision of facilities to regional councillors, minutes of meetings&mdash;except where the meetings or the minutes are closed in relation to the exceptions I have mentioned&mdash;and other documents which would otherwise be accessible under freedom of information legislation.  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill also allows for the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs to appoint an administrator to ATSIC or to the Torres Strait Regional Authority in the event that the minister is satisfied that the administration of public money by ATSIC or <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> by the Torres Strait Regional Authority involves fraud or gross mismanagement by the board of ATSIC or the Torres Strait Regional Authority. The minister would also be able to appoint an administrator should ATSIC or the Torres Strait Regional Authority breach a direction given to it by the minister. In this regard, the minister recently issued directions to both ATSIC and the Torres Strait Regional Authority requiring that proposed grants and loans be subject to the scrutiny of a special auditor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This power will enable the government to oversee the administration of public money by ATSIC or the Torres Strait Regional Authority and to act quickly to stop any misuse of taxpayers' money. Of course, I would expect that the appointment of an administrator would be resorted to only in extreme circumstances. I hope an administrator will never be necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once appointed, the administrator would assume control of the organisation's property and affairs and perform the powers and functions normally undertaken by ATSIC or the Torres Strait Regional Authority as the case may be. The organisation would continue to operate with the administrator making decisions which would otherwise be made by the ATSIC Board of Commissioners or the Torres Strait Regional Authority members. In this way, the provision of services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people would proceed with minimal disruption while whatever problems identified are examined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The administrator will be able to conduct reviews and recommend changes to the structure and operations of ATSIC or the Torres Strait Regional Authority. This would ensure that the difficulties which led to appointment of the administrator can be remedied during the administrator's appointment and will not be repeated in the future. In this way, the elected representatives would be in the best possible position to resume control when the appointment of the administrator ends.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3079"> In the end, this is necessary given, as I said before, that the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs is the person under the Westminster system who is respon sible to the parliament for the expenditure of public funds, even by a body such as ATSIC. I present the explanatory memorandum for the information of honourable members. I commend the bill to the House. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is important to put on the record at the outset the contempt in which the government holds this parliament in the way that it has introduced the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 1996 this evening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not blame the Minister for Health and Family Services, the member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), for this event because I do not believe that he was party to what has gone on. In his second reading speech, he stated: </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A bill was introduced in the Senate on 23 June 1996 and considered by the Senate on 25 and 26 June 1996. The bill was amended by the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA>There are a number of key amendments, and that is what we were waiting on&mdash;the amendments to the bill by the Senate. In the second reading speech that the minister delivered&mdash;it is a printed second reading speech&mdash;it says:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3080">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government cannot accept these amendments. As a consequence, the government has decided to introduce a new bill in the House of Representatives in identical terms to that introduced in the Senate on 23 June 1996.</PARA>
<PARA>When did we find out about that? Behind the Speaker's chair after the second reading speech had been commenced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an absolute disgrace! Is it any wonder that indigenous leaders like Noel Pearson are despairing? We had the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in the House yesterday expressing moral indignation at the criticism that he received from Noel Pearson for an interview on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> and also for some comments at the Press Club. This government's action does not match its rhetoric. It has, from its inception, treated indigenous people with contempt and played politics with indigenous people's lives&mdash;low&hyphen;grade politics. From the outset, we have had a government that has gone after indigenous groups; the most vulnerable groups in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we had as the basis for this bill being introduced by this government was a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program with a number of allegations. We had the Prime Minister and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron), in their outraged state, conducting a press conference on 10 April 1996 and announcing measures that the cabinet were introducing, based on allegations from a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program. At the same time, what did they do? They commissioned audit reports into a number of legal services. And what happened? Yesterday, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs tabled in the Senate the five audited reports. And what do they do? A proper reading of those reports clears ATSIC. Thank God there was no death penalty, because they were hung, drawn and quartered by the coalition!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The excuse of endemic corruption and accountability of public funds was used by this government to introduce these draconian measures which were to take away from ATSIC and indigenous people the right, for the first time, to elect the chair of ATSIC. They have never had that right before. In October and November 1993, the parliament debated that issue, and legislation was passed allowing for an elected chair at the next round <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of elections. So they could not use the fact that there was an elected chair as an excuse for these measures as a result of endemic corruption or whatever. They used it as an excuse to appoint an administrator. This is a beat&hyphen;up of monumental proportions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The story needs to be told that the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs went to cabinet with a proposal in relation to the elected chair and the regional councillors. He was comprehensively mauled by the cabinet. The concept of a special auditor and the concept of an administrator was introduced by cabinet. They wanted to sack ATSIC there and then and were told they could not. What has happened since? No consultation. There was a committee hearing by Senate members last Friday, and it was embarrassing. The performance by the minister in relation to the efforts of consultation was embarrassing. The chair of ATSIC gets advised of a cabinet decision in relation to the administrator half an hour before the press conference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet we are told by this government that this is a government for all of us. They campaigned on the slogan `For all of us', and what has happened since they have been elected? `For all of us' has been modified. It does not include indigenous people&mdash;they were the first targets. It does not include migrants&mdash;they were the second targets. It does not include the unemployed&mdash;they were the third targets, followed by public servants and unionists. Why? This is an opinion poll&hyphen;driven government. It has been driven by opinion polls since the current Prime Minister became the Leader of the Opposition. Remember the facts: in about February last year, before the budget, republic advertising went astray and ended up on my fax machine. This is all about opinion polls. Low&hyphen;grade politics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Eden&hyphen;Monaro (Mr Nairn) knows all about push polling. There are a number of reports circulating about his involvement in the Northern Territory. I will tell you what this bill does&mdash;the bill that this government reintroduced into the House of Representatives today in the form in which it was introduced into the Senate. There was a cartoon by Bill Leake in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3081"> yesterday on page 12 captioned: `Do it yourself surgery with Dr Herron. #1: revamping a government body.' Another caption says, `First we rip out the heart,' and the patient is ATSIC. The second caption says, `. . . and then we replace the head.' Then you have the black head replaced by a white head.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is what the proposal will do. You do not want an independent chairperson who is there fighting on behalf of indigenous people. You want to appoint your lackey. Janet Holmes a Court, a reputable businesswoman, was appointed prior to the calling of an election and tapped on the shoulder after the election. It is just not on. What kind of message does that send to the rest of the community?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is it any wonder that former senator Chris Puplick, head of the anti&hyphen;discrimination board, went on radio in New South Wales shortly after these proposals were announced and pointed out in no uncertain terms that there has been an increase in racist behaviour, that indigenous people are being singled out and that racist taunts and attacks are on the increase? Why? Because we have a government that does not understand, that is absolutely insensitive when it comes to indigenous people. The way the government members have conducted themselves in relation to this bill shows it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should have a look at the actions. We exempted this bill from the cut&hyphen;off in the Senate. We were told, `This is an urgent bill because there are elections in October 1996 for ATSIC. Can we consider it in the current session of parliament?' We said, `Fine, we will look at the merit of the bill.' So this bill was not subjected to the normal cut-off. There are many aspects of this bill that passed through the Senate with opposition and minor party support. A number of things in this bill will improve the round of elections with regard to ATSIC and that will help improve accountability. We are not saying that the current bill and the current structure are perfect and do not require modification or amendment or cannot be improved, but let us have some consultation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What do these audit reports do? These audit reports show what the government has been <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> engaging in. What has the minister done? He has not come out and said, `ATSIC is cleared.' He has said, `There have been a number of breaches, most of which are minor, technical breaches.' In a number of instances, it is ATSIC that has been criticised for trying to protect public moneys. ATSIC has been criticised in relation to the New South Wales legal services because they are only releasing moneys on a quarterly basis, not on an annual basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The way the government has treated this matter is a joke. It was policy on the run. I do not blame the poor Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, who was censured in the Senate today; I blame the cabinet. This is a classic example of why you should not have policy on the run. The poor old minister who was given this portfolio unexpectedly&mdash;he did not expect to be a minister&mdash;has a reputation for decency. What has the cabinet done to him? They have put lead in his saddlebags. They have now given him a poisoned chalice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would not mind standing here before the parliament today and saying, `All these measures were justified,' if that is what these audit reports were saying. They are not saying that. When were they tabled? They were tabled on the day the bill went down in the Senate. There are matters in relation to these audit reports that will require the ATSIC Act to be amended. I say to the government, despite their ineptitude in the way they have handled this to date: the opposition will support measures in relation to accountability but it will not support measures that are aimed at taking away self-determination when there is no basis, no foundation for what the government is doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We heard this bleeding heart cry from the government that we should not worry about land because they are going to look after health. They are going to make sure that communities are serviced. What has happened? The special auditor is costing $750,000, straight out of ATSIC funds. That is $750,000 less that will be spent on Aboriginal communities. It is the most audited department in the Commonwealth. There was a situation where National Rail overspent its <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3082"> budget by $80 million. The deficit was $100 million, two&hyphen;column inches. The double standards that are being imposed on indigenous people in this country are a joke.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are low-grade politicians around this countryside who are playing politics with indigenous people. It is popular. The measure of a country, the measure of a government and the measure of a political party is how we treat the most disadvantaged and vulnerable in our community. It is how you treat them. We are a decent society. I am not saying we do everything right. I am not saying that people are not entitled to different views but it is pretty low-grade politics when your politics are based on the colour of someone's skin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will circulate some amendments that we believe will improve aspects of the bill. In relation to those people qualified to stand for regional councils and for the commission, I suggest the government consider the way in which the act is structured because at the moment it relates to penalty only. It talks about imprisonment of 12 months or more or, regarding embezzlement matters, imprisonment of three months or more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment we successfully moved in the Senate is similar to what is contained in the constitution. That is, it is based on the penalty for which the person has been convicted. So, if it is an offence that carries 12 months imprisonment or more, you are disqualified from holding office or from standing for office for the period of the sentence or for the period of the recognisance. I think the community would be concerned if someone were convicted of embezzlement and still occupied their position if they did not receive a sentence. Sadly, that is the situation at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our measure is to improve the qualifications of people's eligibility to stand. If you are convicted of an offence that carries 12 months or more, I happen to believe that, similar to members of parliament, you should be disqualified from holding office or standing for parliament. There is some misconception. I notice that the minister implied in the debate in the Senate that he thought we were breaking down that qualification&mdash;we <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are not. If you were to be sentenced to three months imprisonment for embezzlement, I think there is every chance of that type of offence carrying a term of imprisonment of 12 months or more. It was for that reason we deleted those amendments in the Senate in relation to the three months imprisonment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am happy to talk to government advisers in this regard because we are about doing this properly&mdash;we are not about doing it on the run. That is the last thing that decent people in the indigenous community, and indeed in the general community, want. That is my main criticism of this. As an opposition we have said all along that, if there is a case to be made out, let us sit down and take the politics out of this portfolio. You are not in opposition now. You won. You have a three-year term. You will be judged on your record. But, quite frankly, your record at the moment is one of insensitivity, and there is also despair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had a situation where the minister, again, as I understand it, has had to say to the Senate that he has to amend the special auditor provisions because there are these unintended consequences resulting from the general direction of CDEP funding. That is why the minister ended up being censured in the Senate today. It is not because he has intentionally done these things. This is a complicated area; it is not as simple as it looks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not here just to take an oppositionist point of view. There are people who have longstanding experience here and I say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that it is in the interests of all of us&mdash;unless you are playing politics&mdash;to take this off the front page, to get it right. It is about service delivery. But the community would be concerned to find out that $750,000 for six months only is being spent on a special auditor, when these audit reports show that the Office of Evaluation and Audit has the necessary statutory authority under the ATSIC Act at the moment&mdash;and as for resources, that office could do with the resources. If amendments are required to chase the money trail, let us make them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The irony is that in the hearings the chairperson of ATSIC disclosed that the Office of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3083"> Evaluation and Audit uses the top six companies: KPMG Peat Marwick, et cetera. They are also the special auditors. So what we have here is an overload. I do not blame the minister for this because, under our rules, he had this imposed on him by cabinet. I blame cabinet; I blame those rednecks and their attitudes. I believe that you have to do away with your prejudices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the reduction of regional councils, I had a chart prepared for our caucus. I understand where that recommendation comes from&mdash;there was a review. There is a review after each round of ATSIC elections to see whether the system is working and to put forward recommendations on how it can be improved. You also need to understand that just because the ATSIC commissioners do a review does not necessarily mean that indigenous people on the ground or in regional councils support that view or have been consulted about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1990, when the first round of ATSIC elections occurred, there were 60 regional councils and 809 regional councillors. Then there was a review which said, `Too big, unworkable.' They cut the number of regional councils from 60 to 36, with the number of representatives going from 809 to 593. That is a big cut&mdash;a cut of 216, to be exact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has happened with this recommendation is that they have used a mathematical formula again, and I do not think people appreciate the unintended consequences of that. It has meant slashing and burning across all regional councils&mdash;urban regional councils and country regional councils. If the government's proposals are accepted, a further 196 regional councillors will go. That is a huge cut to make as the number will then go down to 397. So in 1990 they had 809. If these proposals are carried, they will end up with 397&mdash;a reduction of more than half.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are concerned about is that in remote areas, large areas, some distinct communities will miss out. I have been having consultations in relation to this proposal. Some regional councils concede that they could do with smaller representation, but they want to be talked through it. We went through a debate with ATSIC when we were in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government about the provision of health services. There was initial resistance, but those proposals were accepted over time after there having been consultation. It is pleasing that on my trips around the country councillors are revealing that those services are working much better under the auspices of the department of health.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this area our position was, `Look, let's have a look at the proposal on its merits.' And the reason we are opposing the reduction with the amendments we will move later this evening is that we think that because it is not a reduction in the number of regional councils and it is just mathematically based that the government needs to have a look, have a review. This was one of the amendments that were successfully moved in the Senate: to look at these remote communities. So we will back you on a reduction, but let us do it more sensitively. It is too soon now to just go to this formula.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was impressed by the large number of women on regional councils. This proposal will affect regional councils. There are some regional councils whose operations will improve on some of the numbers that this new formula will give them; but there are others that will not. We would say to the government, `Look, you have the numbers in the Reps, there's no doubt about that. This will be voted on on party lines, and there is every chance that you will get a majority of the Independents.' That is fine, that is the way it is. The tragedy is that this will achieve nothing because this bill now will just lie fallow in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What will happen is that you will have a round of elections that will be conducted on the present system. That is the great tragedy. Because of the way the government has now gone about this&mdash;that is, not attempting to split this bill&mdash;a lot of good amendments are just not going to come into operation for a while.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to that, I say to the government: go forward with the current regional council structure. Let's have a review. Let's have a look at some of these distinct communities and we might be able, in relation to a number of the regional councils, to have provisions <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3084"> inserted into the act that protect those people in remote and distinct communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third proposal, for an administrator, is just not on. The opposition will not support that proposal. It is like using a sledgehammer to crack a walnut. The reality is that cabinet wanted to sack the elected commissioners at the cabinet meeting and were told that they could not do it. We are told that this proposal is there and will only be used in extreme circumstances. It is not necessary. It is not required. If there is endemic corruption, then people should be prosecuted. If there is incompetence, then people should be sacked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that in the last week the minister himself exercised his power under the existing act to move against one of the commissioners. He has lost the argument in relation to the elected board because there are provisions in the act as it presently stands to allow him to move against the board or individual commissioners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot see how you need this provision in relation to an administrator if you are serious about self-determination. But what is more disturbing is that in your policy&mdash;this is your policy and you have put it in the marketplace&mdash;you said that in relation to ATSIC you would consult. There was no consultation in relation to this matter. This was a knee&hyphen;jerk reaction. Of all the proposals in this bill, this is the one we find most objectionable. It implies that we are going to have the sword of Damocles hanging over your head.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The audit reports show that there are problems in relation to the delivery of services with some of these legal services and we will look at that on its merits. We give the undertaking to the government that if there is proper consultation with the opposition and the minor parties in the Senate there will be no problems. There will be no problems in relation to making it more efficient in terms of the delivery of services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not saying that we on this side are the only ones who have a genuine concern or the right answers in relation to this, but the way this has been introduced is ham&hyphen;fisted and inept. Sadly, it has put lead in the saddle bags of the new minister. It has made it terribly <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> difficult for him because he has had to go out and back the cabinet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would not mind if cabinet had its submission before it&mdash;a proper submission based on these audit reports. There has been a bit of misrepresentation in relation to these audit reports. A proper reading of them will reveal that the Office of Evaluation and Audit in a lot of instances, like the New South Wales and the Victorian legal services, put in the financial controllers and the administrators. They have been monitoring the situation since it was brought to their attention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth while quoting the New South Wales situation. You would have us believe, from the way the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program did it, that they were the ones who discovered the problems. Well, they did not. It is worth while reading this for the background. The audit report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a direct result of the preliminary findings of the investigation, ATSIC re&hyphen;engaged Coopers &amp; Lybrand in May 1994, this time to act as Grant Controller to the Legal Service. In addition, ATSIC's Chief Executive Officer referred the matter to the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) on 14 July 1994 as it was considered that the findings in the Coopers &amp; Lybrand report were of a magnitude that warranted further investigation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ASC have investigated this matter and have responded to ATSIC. In correspondence dated 21 March 1996&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>after we were defeated, that is&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the ASC advised ATSIC's Chief Executive Officer that</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">". . . after comprehensive enquiries the ASC has now completed its investigation into the affairs of the ALS. There is no present intention to take criminal action against the ALS or any person associated with the ALS. . . ."</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ASC still holds some documentation of the Legal Service as they are currently preparing a report in accordance with Section 17 of the Corporations Law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the period of the ASC investigation, ATSIC have continued to engage Coopers &amp; Lybrand as the Grant Controller and, at the date of this report, Coopers &amp; Lybrand still continue to act in this position.</PARA>
<PARA>ATSIC, in relation to that service, as the other reports reveal, were the ones who initiated action. They had grant controllers in there. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3085"> We are talking about past events. That is not to say that there does not need to be some amendment to the act to allow the Office of Evaluation and Audit to follow the money trail and probably to direct the legal services. That is constructive, but what I am saying is: that does not justify an administrator. That does not justify taking away the independence of ATSIC in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we were in government and Gerry Hand was the minister for Aboriginal affairs, we accepted every recommendation of the Department of Finance at that time and those recommendations were included in the act. Over $8 million has been spent by ATSIC since its inception&mdash;and the figure could be more&mdash;in relation to auditing of money that is going to the communities. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to support the ATSIC Amendment Bill, I must first of all mention the passion level of the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham). It is a pity that he did not have a lot more passion when the former Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Mr Tickner, was at the helm on behalf of Aboriginal people. Thirteen years of Labor have done nothing for the Aboriginal communities throughout the Northern Territory. It has been 13 years of neglect and some communities have gone backwards over that time. He has the passion here tonight to knock the bill that we said we wanted some urgency on. But because we did not play according to Hoyle he does not want to support the bill and wants it to go back to the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> ATSIC has been operating for six years, and what has it been able to do in that time? Aboriginals out in northern Australia are saying, `Let's go back to the old days of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. At least we got things done in those days.' Today in 1996 when you go through the communities, health services are lacking, and they blame the state and territory governments for not providing the services. But look at the budget of over $1 billion a year that ATSIC gets. Back in 1991&hyphen;92 and the earlier days of the Depart ment of Aboriginal Affairs it was about $400 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the first 10 minutes, all the honourable member spoke about was the republic, push polling and cartoons. He said  that opposition members understand this matter while government members do not. We do understand. He admitted that there were some provisions in the bill that he accepted and I am very pleased to hear it. But then he spoke about&mdash;and I do not know who he was referring to&mdash;low&hyphen;grade politicians whose policies are based on the colour of your skin. I do not know who he was referring to, but I have a fair idea, as the member for the Northern Territory, of what it was like to compete against somebody in a particular community about the colour of your skin. He knows what I am talking about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We talk about the skillshare funding today, how we have no money and the honourable senator has to borrow money out of the budget for next year to provide funds for skillshare. That is because it was all knocked off in February and March. It was all spent; there was nothing left in the bank.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5M6">Mr DONDAS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I've got my facts right. With regard to self&hyphen;determination, I do not believe that the Australian Labor Party policies gave true self&hyphen;determination to Aboriginals in this country. It did not let them make their own decisions. In the Northern Territory, land councils have been able to operate within the parameters together with ATSIC, but why do we see such a sad state of affairs in Australia in 1996 in remote communities where there is a lack of decent housing, a lack of decent education, a lack of decent health and Aboriginals are unable to promote and develop their own ideas?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This ATSIC Amendment Bill has four main aims. One is to reduce the size of regional councils, which were established under the act in 1989. The honourable member for Banks admitted earlier that they were too big. But when you think that you only have to be voted in by three people in your region to become a councillor and earn over $50,000 a year, there is something wrong with the act. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3086"> There has to be. We all know Charlie Perkins. He was elected to council by 129 votes. How do you work that out?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs appoint the chairperson of ATSIC is something that I support. Obviously the honourable member for Banks takes great umbrage at that. He says, `This is not going to go through this parliament, it is not going to go through the Senate, because we do not support this. We understand what you are trying to do, but we do not support it.' Why not try something different? You had 13 years.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5M6">Mr DONDAS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The review panel that created ATSIC's electoral boundaries in 1993 recommended the number of regional councils be reduced. The government agrees with the strategy as a way of improving the councils' efficiency in providing a more effective service to indigenous Australians. The bill provides for accountability and its measures include opening meetings to the public, except in certain circumstances where meetings must be closed for reasons of confidentiality, and providing access to papers of regional council meetings like agendas, policies, papers and minutes. </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current process whereby the commission is made up of 17 electorate commissioners and two ministerial appointees will remain. The minister will then appoint the chairperson of the commission from this group of 19. It could be one of the ministerial appointees or it could be any one of the other 17 who are elected. I completely support that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will also allow the minister to appoint an administrator to ATSIC or the Torres Strait Regional Authority in the event that the minister believes there is a serious question about the administration of public funds involving fraud and gross mismanagement. This means the government will have a better idea of how public funds are being used.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Banks raised a point about what happens if somebody is charged with embezzlement under the act. The current act provides a 12&hyphen;month penalty. They want to amend that to three months. In some communities embezzlement is not always seen as embezzlement. I need to explain that. Sometimes a skin group may have authority to handle money and a person within that group might be under some pressure from their own family to hand on some of those funds. Whilst that person is not embezzling the money on their own behalf, they are certainly misusing public funds. If the act is amended to three months and that person went before a magistrate, they might get the three&hyphen;month penalty because they were under pressure to embezzle. The penalty has to be for a longer term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the important thing is that the coalition has the mandate to provide reasonable services to the Australian community but, more importantly, to disadvantaged groups. We all know that there are disadvantaged groups in remote parts of Australia of Aboriginal descent. In some communities there are no employment opportunities; in some communities there are no educational opportunities; and in some communities there are no health opportunities. People from those communities have to be transported to other communities for those services. When they are transported from their own community to another area they do become disoriented. They want to go <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3087"> back home. But some of these communities are too small to have infrastructure in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The out-station movement has really burgeoned in the last 10 years. Ten years ago people would ask: what is an out&hyphen;station? Today out-stations are predominantly made up of people who have moved from bigger communities to smaller communities. People move away for many reasons. They move away because of the skin group. They move away because of woman trouble. They move away because of petrol sniffing. They move away because of grog. They move to smaller communities so they are not really involved with the major part of the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The important thing is that this government recognises there is a problem and is trying to do something about it. It is trying to get value&mdash;value&mdash;for money, which I do not believe the Australian Labor Party did. You had 13 years&mdash;the honourable member for Banks&mdash;to do something about it. Before the Labor Party came into power 13 years ago, some of these communities were model communities. Today when you drive through those communities&mdash;and I am ashamed to say it&mdash;if you had a pet dog you would not let the pet dog out of your car.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is an indictment of the Australian Labor Party's 13 years of neglect, and it has the audacity tonight to say, `We're not going to support this legislation because you haven't given us the right time, you haven't followed the deal' and all the rest of it. We are debating this legislation tonight. The debate is going to finish at 10.30 p.m. and eventually, hopefully, it will become a reality so that things can happen. Obviously we get passionate about it because there are rights and wrongs. When I move around some of these communities I see the wrongs.</PARA>

I have seen it but I have worked against it. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst the Australian Labor Party might not have tried to do its best for our indigenous community, the Northern Territory has a very good example of trying to work closely in collaboration with ATSIC, especially in the Indigenous Housing Authority of the Northern Territory, established by the bilateral agreement between the Northern Territory government, the Commonwealth and ATSIC and signed in July 1995. This is the first and, to date, only example of such an agreement pursuant to the `National commitment to improved outcomes in the delivery of programs and services for Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders' endorsed by the Council of Australian Governments in 1992. The national Aboriginal health strategy and health infrastructure priority projects programs have built a bond between the indigenous housing community and the territory community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole question of credibility keeps turning up. Sure, sometimes you can allow mistakes. You can allow lots of different things. But you cannot allow bad decisions which cost the rest of the community. The honourable member for Banks said that they spent $8 million on audit fees. That is $8 million less in housing, $8 million less in health and $8 million less in education. Why would an organisation, if it were squeaky clean, have to spend $8 million on audit fees?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister, in presenting this legislation to both houses for consideration, is doing it for a good reason. He is doing it because, as he said in his second reading speech, he wanted to see the Australian community get better value for money. That is all it is&mdash;better value for money. If these amendments to this legislation do that, he will have succeeded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that there was a censure motion in the Senate this afternoon against the minister for Aboriginal affairs. What a disgrace! This man is trying to do something for a poorer section of the Australian community. What a disgrace! It is a numbers game. The honourable member for Banks said <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3088"> that the minister for Aboriginal affairs was a decent man. Of course he is a decent man. He is an honourable man. But you guys have put the iron in his saddlebags. The members of the Labor Party are the ones who have put the iron in the saddlebags. They are to blame.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said earlier, the honourable member for Banks was very passionate in his defence of this legislation, and I am very passionate in support of this legislation. I unreservedly support the legislation before us. I hope that you go home tonight and you have a good think about it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is the sort of inane comment which does the honourable gentleman no credit at all. Let me talk about one of the things that happened when I became a minister. Within the first 24 hours, I was rung by two former ministers for Aboriginal affairs who were from the other side of politics, who not merely congratulated me upon my appointment but offered me the benefit of their knowledge and their experience. On at least several occasions I had occasion to call on that, and on several occasions they came to see me to draw my attention to matters which were within their knowledge and not mine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I am entering into this debate I want to do so, first of all, on behalf of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron). I assure members of this House that, having had a number of portfolios, I know that there is no more difficult or complex portfolio.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The problem for the honourable gentleman is not his prejudices; it is his tiny mind, and I cannot ask him to put that aside.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that, while the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Dondas) may speak on this legislation and give us the benefit of his knowledge, the problems in the Northern Territory are not the problems of Aboriginal communities in Fitzroy and Melbourne. The problems of Aboriginal people in Fitzroy and Melbourne are not even the problems of the Aboriginal people living on the Murray or in Shepparton.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is what makes this portfolio so difficult to administrate. This is why, in my view, the government, with the best intentions in the world, should not be rushing this sort of legislation through the parliament. They should be giving the minister the time and opportunity to get across this portfolio and to meet more Aboriginal people and Aboriginal leaders in order to win their confidence; because there is no minister who has come into this portfolio who does not have a very difficult task.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I spent the first two years in my portfolio, because money was being taken, making a very simple proposition in  every community I went to. It was to say very simply this: when money comes into the portfolio of Aboriginal affairs, it is not the government's money; it is your money. If for any reason you steal it, you are going to go to gaol. It is as simple as that. On several occasions that occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I used to receive letters which were almost indecipherable from secretaries of Aboriginal people who had been elected by their own community. Why? Because they employed their daughters or a relative's daughter. Why? Because it would almost be a loss of face in that community if you did not employ one of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3089"> your own. This is the pattern of indigenous people not just in Australia but in other parts of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of land rights and as a result of government programs, it is perfectly true that in some communities you have rich Aboriginals and you have poor ones. You have Aboriginal people who have hung onto the strength of their culture and their beliefs. You only have to go to certain parts of Australia and put your backside down in the dirt and it will take 20 minutes before a conversation starts. The first two people who will speak will not be the principal person, and then you will hear from the old man who is the acknowledged leader of that community. That is how it operates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be of great value to the minister to go and sit down under a tree with perhaps Bill Neidjie&mdash;a man learned in the law, one of the older men who has written and committed his law to paper because he was so concerned to preserve Aboriginal culture. He was the first Aboriginal person to actually sit down and write his story to try to reproduce his culture so that his grandchildren would have something to hang onto.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many great people in Aboriginal society, but they are like the rest of us. There is good and bad in every community. In my profession, I am sad to see it when colleagues rort their trust funds and go to gaol. But there has been no government in any state parliament saying, `Look, solicitors are stealing trust funds. Perhaps what we had better do is have the Attorney-General appoint the president of the law council or the law institute.' This view in many ways, unfortunately, has permeated the culture of this parliament when it comes to dealing with Aboriginal affairs. Unfortunately, I think it was perpetrated in a book recently published and launched by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, and I hope he did that on the basis that he had not read it but thought he was doing the right thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things I have learned&mdash;and it was a hard learning course&mdash;is the whole concept of assimilation. Governments decided that the best thing you could do for Aboriginal people was that, if they were going to die <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> out, you could take their children, move them from their natural parents and put them in hospitals far away from home. They were not evil. They were not bad. They had a perception that everything would be all right if Aboriginal people would only be like us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is one of the reasons that so often in this parliament the conversation turns on money, housing and health. That is not to say that those things are not important. They are important. But I suspect that what is behind that is the view that if we fix up the health and housing side of things and there is a school they can go to, they will be like us&mdash;and that is a fallacy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish that this minister could be given time to breathe, to move into the broader aspects of Aboriginal society. Perhaps he could visit the Northern Territory, where we have the finest rock art collection in the world. In France 200,000 tourists a year look at a rock art collection that does not compete. I wish the minister had time to walk through the bush with eight&hyphen; and 10&hyphen;year&hyphen;old kids; they see things that we do not see. We can meet Aboriginal people who have made for themselves a significant lifestyle, but who have not abandoned their culture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that we in this parliament realise that we are dealing with people who have the oldest existing culture in the world. Many Aboriginal people have moved into high positions in our society and have become very successful in the things that they have done. They have also gone through traditional ceremonies. Some of them have done that at a fairly late stage in life. At the end of that experience, they say that it was the most significant thing that has happened to them in their lifetime. Despite all the things that have happened to Aboriginal people, that is a legacy which, in a spirit of generosity, they are happy to share with us. The day that this community is strong enough, brave enough and morally courageous enough to lift up our hands and pick that up is the day that we will be well on the way towards not only solving their problems but also a lot of ours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This problem has bedevilled all governments. Some people might believe that passing this legislation in this way tonight will <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3090"> give this minister a quick fix. What it will do is place him in a position where he will have great difficulty in winning the confidence of Aboriginal people. Think about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Look at the various structures in our society that have made mistakes. There is no argument that ATSIC is less than perfect. But I do not know that it is any less perfect in its processes than this parliament or the state parliaments. But to move to a stage of saying, `This government is going to make the minister choose the chairman, whether he wants to or not' is to put Aboriginal groups around Australia in a position of saying, `They don't trust us. We're back to the old model. We're back to a situation where it is white fellas telling us which black fella is going to be our boss.' What will happen? There is bound to be some Aboriginal&mdash;a reasonable salary is attached to the position&mdash;who will face the problems. But that is wrapping around the neck of the minister concepts that he is going to have to live with in relation to every Aboriginal community in Australia. I do not believe that is fair to him. I do not even think it is fair to this government, to be candid. There are no quick fixes in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, I believe that the government should pause&mdash;there is no great urgency to pass this legislation in the dying hours of this session of parliament&mdash;to give this minister time. It does not matter whether or not you dismiss what occurred in the Senate today as a political exercise. The real issue is what Aboriginal communities the length and breadth of Australia are going to think about that. Aboriginal communities are as politically divided as the rest of society. They are going to say, `We are dealing with a minister who wants to tell us what his solutions are instead of sitting down and listening to us and talking to us, addressing these problems together.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Would it have made any real difference if Lois O'Donoghue had been left in her position for another 12 months? Would it have made any real difference to anybody except Aboriginal people, the present ATSIC commissioners and, most importantly, the minister? With the best intentions in the world, what the government has done here is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to virtually place the minister on a crucifix. You are not giving him the time that he needs. Regardless of his skills and capacities in his own profession, he does not come to this portfolio with any great background or knowledge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a major learning curve that he has a right to be across. What you are doing is placing a burden on him which will haunt him for the rest of his period as a minister. If there is any sensitivity and if there is any commonsense, I would say to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and I would say to his cabinet colleagues: don't be in any hurry to pass this legislation. Give the minister time to establish the relationships he needs to have. Give the minister time to reach out and establish relationships not just with Aboriginal people but also with island people. They are also his responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I choose to finish where I started. There is a real difference within states. Urban and semi&hyphen;urban Aboriginal people in Western Australia are a hell of a lot different from those living around Broome in the north&hyphen;west of Western Australia and different again from those living in the desert areas straddling their tribal areas that cross the boundaries of South Australia and Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a time, when I first came into this parliament, when members from various parts of Australia had a knowledge of and a relationship with Aboriginal people, but unfortunately such has been the nature and the development of our parliament that that is no longer the case. There are no quick fix solutions. There is no one single piece of legislation that is going to change the way Aboriginal people relate to the government, relate to each other and relate to a dominant white society. Some are emerging through that society who still want to retain their Aboriginal culture and tradition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are complex human issues. There is no point in entering this debate on the basis that the Labor government got it all wrong. We got a hell of a lot of it right and we also got some of it wrong. That has been the history of every federal government that has tried to tackle this problem. But you are doing your own government and your own minister <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3091"> grievous harm by whacking this legislation through the parliament in the dying hours of this sitting when there are all sorts of functions going on in this institution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Aboriginal people, whatever their shortcomings, whatever their problems, are worthy of a more sophisticated approach to their problems and to this issue than the one that is currently being displayed in this parliament. This approach of the government, in my view, will not do anything but put it in a situation that it does not have to be in. It will put the minister in a situation, if he has any background at all, if anyone can talk to him about it, which no minister should be in in the early days of his ministry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To that extent, I hope I have pointed out, in a bipartisan way, that this is not the way to go, this is not the way to proceed. It is about building new relationships. The government is entitled to produce new concepts and try to make them work. This minister will make his mistakes, as every minister has made his mistakes, but at the end of the day I believe that on all sides of the House there are members who have a genuine concern to deal with the problems of our Aboriginal people, our indigenous people. They have much to benefit from a positive response and we as a community have a great deal to gain from reaching out and understanding that culture, its relationship to this great land of ours and, more importantly, its relationship to our children and the future of this country.</PARA>

There is a need to understand the culture that is out there, which is very different to ours, particularly for those of us who come from urban Australia. There is no doubt that he was right when he talked about the need to get out there and talk to people in slow time, to be accepted, to consult and so on. I have a great deal of respect for many of the comments he made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have to say to the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham), who spoke before the member for Melbourne Ports, that I have some difficulty with some of his comments.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Banks has let his emotions carry away his logic. I would like to address a few comments to the honourable gentleman from Banks. First, the shadow minister talked about the double standards of tactics in this place. I would have to say to the honourable gentleman that his side of the House is in no position to make comments about tactics in this place. I sat over the other side of the House for six years when he used to be over this side. The tactics that you used in this place quite frequently were totally unprincipled&mdash;and you know it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member also talked about the misreading of audit reports. It does not matter, frankly, whether the audit reports are current <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3092"> or how they are read or not read. The truth is that the government that you were part of in the previous parliament and the parliament before that knew all about the audit reports that came into this place. You knew all about the problems. The basic fact is that you failed to deal with them adequately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can remember when I was the shadow minister that I would frequently be talking to the then minister about what we could do about some of the problems reported in those audit reports. The reality was that there was a distinct disinclination to do anything about those audit reports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would suggest to the member for Banks that if many of those failures had been identified&mdash;and I am not singling out ATSIC; I am talking about any government bureaucracy&mdash;and were actually dealt with at that stage, we probably would not have found it necessary to be introducing this legislation today. It is the failure over a number of years to deal with known problems that has precipitated this sort of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable gentleman for Banks says that he accepts part of the bill. I am glad that he does. Of course, much of it is legislation that the other side wanted to introduce. But having said that, when it was convenient, when the honourable gentleman from the Northern Territory (Mr Dondas) was speaking, he said very blithely, `I was not in the last ministry,' as if the things that went wrong were not his fault. The reality is that he was a member of the government. He was on the government's side. He had input into that government. Now he is the shadow minister. And he cannot run away from his responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> I would have to say that one of the things that I have found galling throughout my six years in this place is the frequently expressed sanctimonious view of the other side that all care resides on that side and not on this side. Yet the honourable gentleman sat at the table in this serious debate and called quorums ad infinitum when speakers got up to talk on these matters. If you want to talk about these matters seriously, then that is not the way to behave. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS> By calling a quorum, the shadow minister has merely demon strated very graphically the point that I was making.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us talk about the substance of the bill and the regional councils. It seems to me, as I have travelled around this country in the last five years on matters to do with indigenous affairs, that the regional councils have had a number of significant problems. It is time that we looked at some of those problems. It seems to me that we have had a situation where there have been large numbers of regional councils which have very small constituencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yes, of course there is a need to make sure that different groups and remote communities are properly represented. You cannot always expect that you are going to have the sort of hierarchical representation in the Aboriginal culture that is often so much the case in the broader community. But the reality is that those regional councils often have been poorly staffed. The representatives have not been used to dealing with that format.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We found quite frequently that people had used their positions to their advantage in all sorts of ways. Unfortunately, the regional councils clearly have not been the sort of driving force at the grassroots level that they should have been. Therefore, it is appropriate that we look at restructuring them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Initially, there were 800 members of regional councils for populations of 260,000 to 270,000 people. That is totally disproportionate. It is too many. In this House we have 148 members to represent some 18 million people. The proportion that were present in regional councils, therefore, was totally inappropriate. It is appropriate that we reduce the numbers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Let us also have a look at some of the other issues that are so important and which this government wants to try to address. The previous speaker, the gentleman from Melbourne Ports, with whom I have a degree of common ground, as I said before, said, `Don't blame the previous government. It wasn't their fault.' To a certain extent he was right from the point of view that you will not fix the problems in five minutes: it will take time. I think it is fair to say that we should have seen some improvement in conditions, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3093"> given that the Labor government was there for 13 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Let us look at the subject of housing. Only a couple of years ago a major housing report indicated that to bring Aboriginal housing standards in this country up to par with the rest of the community it would cost some $2 billion. I can remember going to remote communities right across the top end of this country, where you had anywhere from 20 to 25, or even 30-odd, people in a little three-bedroom house. The facts of life are that the previous government failed almost totally to deal with the problems of overcrowding and substandard and inappropriate housing in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. It is a record that in 13 years they should have been able to make some impact on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Let us look at the subject of health. The health of the indigenous population has been a perennial brickbat under the previous government. It was only last year that the previous government decided to transfer responsibility for health back to the former Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence)&mdash;the lady from Fremantle. She set up a great bureaucratic structure which, after three months, had not even been staffed, let alone done anything about health. The reality of life is that Aboriginal health standards have not improved in the last 13 years. If anything, they are getting worse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You know, Mr Deputy Speaker, because you and I have been away with a standing committee of this place on a number of occasions, that if you are born today, in 1996, as an Aboriginal male you have an 18-year less life expectancy than if you are born a non-Aboriginal person. Those sorts of statistics are unacceptable and the shadow minister at the table should understand that his government had 13 years not to fix the problem but to start to improve the problem. The reality is: you did not start to improve those figures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are saying that we are going to do things slightly differently. Until we have had a chance to do some of those things and see the results, I would suggest that you are in no position, after three months, to be sanctimonious and pious. When I stand up here, in a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> democratic society, and put a different point of view, your response is to call a quorum.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I apologise, Mr Deputy Speaker. I will speak through the chair. I merely make the comment that the shadow minister at the table has got the problems of his previous leader, the previous Prime Minister, Mr Keating, in wanting to ramrod things through and not listen to any other point of view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the subject of education in indigenous communities. I challenge any Labor member in this chamber to produce a skerrick of evidence that the standards of Aboriginal education improved in the 13 years they were in government. Let's not talk about retention rates; let's talk about the basics. You can go into any remote Aboriginal community and the local primary school and you will find, because of health, that often 50 per cent of the class have got middle ear infections and they cannot hear. They have a health problem and that means they have an education problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I see the honourable gentleman for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) is sitting in the chamber. I assume he is going to speak next. He knows what I am referring to because he has been with us and has seen some of these things. I do not think any of us are proud about that. We all should be ashamed of it. My point is that although you will not have fixed it in 13 years&mdash;the gentleman from Melbourne Ports is right&mdash;you should have made some improvements. I give you credit for having the concern for wanting to do something about it, but the reality is you were not successful. It was not for want of trying on the part of the honourable member for Charlton and his government; they were well motivated. They used plenty of money, and all the rest of it. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3094"> But the previous government did not achieve the results that they would have desired or that the rest of us would have desired.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, we are trying to do things in a slightly different way. We may even have some differences of view on this side about some of the things we might want to do, but the former government does not have the right to actually criticise what we are doing at this stage&mdash;three months down the track&mdash;because we were elected and we are going to try and do things differently to improve some of those standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Let us look at jobs. As you go round the country, the figure of 80 per cent unemployment is the norm in indigenous Aboriginal communities. How can we possibly say that what went before has been successful? It is an absolute national disgrace. Therefore, we have to look at new ways of doing things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have not talked about some of the more scandalous things concerning custody levels. The reality is that after all the royal commissions, after spending millions of dollars and having every federal government department and state government making annual reports about how they are going to implement the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody&mdash;I agreed with the findings of the royal commission, there is no question about that: both sides of the House did&mdash;those deaths in custody are not only continuing but also getting worse. We have not fixed the problem doing things the way the former government did. We have to look for new ways.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you have bad health, poor housing, a poor education and no job, and every time you look sidewards at a policeman you are going to be locked up because you are between 15 and 19 years of age and are Aboriginal, then you are going to get into bad company. You are going to have time on your hands and you are going to do what anybody in those socioeconomic circumstances is going to do: you are going to get into crime and substance abuse. If you do not do that then you are going to get into welfare dependency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have mass welfare dependency out there. That is what the present system has <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> bred&mdash;whatever the good intentions of the previous government. However much money was spent, whatever fine schemes were dreamt up, we have a poor record and we have not improved it in the last 13 years, and in many areas it is getting worse. Therefore we have to try new ways. That is what this government is going to be all about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will have some internal debates&mdash;that is the best way. I agree with many of the comments that the gentleman from Melbourne Ports made about having to acknowledge the cultural differences. We cannot come into this place and just say, `We're going to do it the way we would do it in my suburban seat in Melbourne.' The reality is that will not work. You can fly into my seat in Melbourne and you can call a particular group&mdash;the youth workers, the unemployed counsellors or whoever it is&mdash;and sit them down. You can have an agenda and you can go zonk, zonk, zonk down the agenda. You can talk about things and people will be up&hyphen;front and argue their case. You can say, `Well, maybe I've got an understanding of the problem. I've got something to deal with.' You know, Mr Deputy Speaker, because you have been out in remote Australia with me and others in this place, that you cannot do that in indigenous communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The gentleman from Melbourne Ports was right. You go in there and the first people who talk to you will not necessarily be the ones who really know what it is all about or have the authority. You can have a big formal meeting&mdash;and you will get everybody from the community there&mdash;and talk about the issues. One or two will talk but, quite clearly, there are people who know better, because you can see the look of horror on their face sometimes when some of the more ridiculous comments are made. But the ones who know will not speak and you know damn well that you are not getting the right input. But, when you adjourn the formal meeting and go outside to sit under the tree or on the verandah and have a cup of tea or stay there for a meal or go back for your third or fourth visit over three or four months and people get to know you, then you start to find out what people really think.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3095">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The indigenous way is not to have an up&hyphen;front conversation. The indigenous way is to have consensus. The indigenous way is to say, `I don't send a representative down south to go and negotiate on my behalf. I send people down to find out what the other lot&mdash;the government, or whoever it is&mdash;want to say, and they come and talk to us. We have got to have time to talk about it.' It is a different way of doing things. I am not saying it is a better way, I am not saying it is a worse way; I am saying it is a different way. We, as a broader Australian community, have to understand that there are those cultural differences. If we are to fix the problems of health, housing, education, jobs, custody levels, welfare dependency and all those things, we have to acknowledge there are different ways of dealing with that community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say to those on the other side of the House that, whilst on many occasions in this place I have taken a bipartisan view and whilst on many occasions I have publicly acknowledged the good intentions of many members on the other side when they were in government and publicly supported many of the programs, at the end of the day there is no evidence that the situation is improving. Therefore, we have to search for new ways of doing things. Whether I like every bit of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 1996 or anybody else does, the reality is we are starting to turn over a new leaf. I urge the House to support the bill. </PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have been providing government, basically, for European Australians for 200 years. One would think from some of the things that I have heard here this evening, and prior, that we had overcome all our problems. What an absurdity. People have been critical of the fact that ATSIC has an annual budget of something like $1 billion. Federally, we have an annual budget of something approaching $150 billion. If we were to extract from that the amount of money which is applied by us to administer the processes of government and to administer government departments and the bureaucracy before we started to deliver actual dollars in services to those people to whom so much of those funds were to be applied, I think people might well come to the conclusion that we have not performed very well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The criticism has also been raised in connection with this legislation that, through ATSIC and through the regional councils, Aboriginals have been in a sense overgoverned, because the proposal is that the number of regional councillors now be reduced. We always hear the claim being made that Australia, as a whole, has been overgoverned. Could I suggest as well that, in that connection, we essentially caucasian Australians have not done too well. Why, then, does it become the flavour of the day for people to be so critical of this exercise on the part of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3096"> this government and previous governments, at the national level, to provide to the extent that they can some process of self&hyphen;determination for Aboriginal people?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For far too long, Mr Deputy Speaker, I think you might agree&mdash;in some of the observations that have been made here this evening and earlier during the debate about this general issue&mdash;there has clearly been an undercurrent of continuing paternalism. Of course, that is reflected in these changes as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is suggested, for example, that the chairperson of ATSIC not be elected by those people whom the chairperson is intended to represent&mdash;as the Prime Minister of Australia is elected in a sense by the broader community&mdash;but be appointed by the minister. The minister will have the individual capacity, without even reference to the commission itself, to appoint an administrator to take over the responsibilities of ATSIC. If that is not tainted with paternalism, I do not know what types of measures that have been introduced in this parliament in the past are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To a very large extent, it reflects two things. Firstly, it reflects the general attitude of conservative people and conservative interests in Australia towards what we might identify as those problems being faced by the Aboriginal community and Aboriginal people. Secondly, it reflects the inadequacy of those people on the other side&mdash;and I will exclude from this the member for Aston (Mr Nugent), because he is one of those genuine people on the government benches and you, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, are another, if I might be permitted to say so. There are a number of very genuine people on the government side who identify with these problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Generally, as I say, there has been an inadequacy on the part of those people who have been appointed by the Liberal Party in particular to represent Aboriginal interests at the government level. For example, one of the major things that brought the present Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) undone when he was a former leader of the Liberal Party was a trip to the Northern Territory where he confused the emotional stress and trauma he said he experienced after seeing the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Aboriginal women's corroboree and as a result of that made some blunders. The only thing is that the blunders were made before the corroboree. To a large extent, that was one of the significant things which brought about the undoing of the present foreign minister, Mr Downer, as leader of the Liberal Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous spokesperson for the coalition parties, the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), admitted that she learnt about Aboriginal questions from watching television of an evening. When we suggested that it might be advisable for her to get out into Aboriginal communities and talk to Aboriginal people, it came as a bit of a surprise to her. She did make some attempt after that to do so. But she had not initially. I sat in this chamber one evening with national leaders of the Aboriginal community sitting up in that gallery while this parliament considered some of these questions, and that spokesperson to whom I referred, the member for Hindmarsh, shouted abuse at those national Aboriginal leaders sitting up in the gallery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If members of the coalition want any reasons why Aboriginal people and Aboriginal communities often look at them with some concern about their attitude, then things of that kind may help to indicate what the problem is. The same member for Hindmarsh, when she was the spokesperson for the coalition parties on this issue, escorted Mr Downer as his adviser to the Northern Territory. Those blunders into which Mr Downer fell could quite easily have been caused by the advice tendered to him on that visit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not just from me. There is a general recognition that the present Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) is nothing short of a disaster. I have no doubt that he is a very competent surgeon. I have no doubt that he is a nice chap. But, in understanding Aboriginal issues and in administering an Aboriginal department, he is a disaster. Apparently, a motion of censure was passed in the Senate this evening against Senator Herron. He has no understanding of some of the sensitivities and complexities of the portfolio with which he <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3097"> has been charged the responsibility of administering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He indicated that he had no idea&mdash;he may have improved more recently&mdash;of the meaning of concepts like assimilation, integration, paternalism or self-determination. One would think that basic concepts of that kind would be part of the essential knowledge bank of someone charged with the responsibility of administering that portfolio. After he was appointed as Aboriginal affairs minister, Senator Herron said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are more good Aboriginal people out there than bad Aboriginal people and I'm going to see that the good ones are going to win.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, we could say that about the white community as well&mdash;we could also say it about the Asian community&mdash;but the very fact that it is expressed exclusively for the Aboriginal community reflects that paternalistic attitude people have towards Aboriginal people. In referring to the $1 billion in the ATSIC budget, he went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If it's only 10 per cent that's being creamed off, that's $100 million we're talking about.</PARA>
<PARA>That was said by a responsible minister with specific responsibilities. So the presumption is that something like 10 per cent or $100 million could be being creamed off. Creamed off by whom?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that over the last six or eight years only a minimal number of people associated with ATSIC have been charged with what we might call `creaming off' or corruption in connection with the funds available to ATSIC. Alan Ramsey, one of our national journalists, about those types of comments said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">If any minister, State or Federal, made a similar remark about some other government&hyphen;funded authority in which, say, the "bad Jewish people" were ripping off "maybe $100 million" of public money to the disadvantage of the "good Jewish people", there'd be hell to pay.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You are a good Deputy Speaker, Mr Deputy Speaker. One of the other things the good senator did in his capacity as Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs was to ask the police to investigate the behaviour of a certain person. In connection with these alleged criminal charges or claims&mdash;apart from the giving of their name, of course&mdash;this person was identified as being `closely linked to a commissioner of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission'. This person was closely linked to a commissioner from ATSIC.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what? All people who are charged with any types of offences are closely linked to someone. But why in this particular case should the person charged with the administration of the department of Aboriginal affairs choose to draw attention to the fact that criminal allegations had been made against someone&mdash;not someone who is a commissioner of ATSIC&mdash;who is closely related to or associated with a commissioner from ATSIC? That is very disturbing. As I say, it reflects, perhaps more than most other things, the way in which there is this presumption of corruption, dishonesty and inadequacy on the part of so many people in their attitude towards Aboriginal people and Aboriginal problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have found the reference to which I referred just a while ago. Two people in six years have been charged with misappropriation of ATSIC funds. I wish our record were as good among people who are occupying positions of responsibility and public trust&mdash;not so much in the parliament but in all those other organisations right through the national community where funds are being used and applied in different ways. For all of the people who have been involved in ATSIC over six years, only two people have been <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3098"> charged with misappropriation of funds. So why is there this perception?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also emphasise that there have been quite a number of people&mdash;some of them with very close associations, formal associations, with the Liberal Party and the National Party&mdash;who have been aghast at some of the claims that have been made in connection with this whole question of ATSIC, these amendments and some of the arguments which have been used to justify them, to explain them and to excuse them. I refer to people like Ian Viner, a former Liberal minister. I refer to Fred Chaney, a former federal minister. I refer to Chris Puplick, a man of great distinction and integrity. I also refer to people from the Aboriginal community like Pat O'Shane and Lois O'Donoghue, who is the Chairman of ATSIC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of those people are people of substance and, I believe, people of honesty, integrity, judgment and clear perception. They have expressed concerns in one way or another. We have people like Mick Dodson, for example, who said&mdash;in reference to that comment by Senator Herron about someone having criminal accusations made against them when they were associated with someone from ATSIC&mdash;that Senator Herron had acted as judge and executioner in saying that he believed the criminal allegations against a person close to an ATSIC commission board member were true.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We just do not do that kind of thing. We do not say that we believe these criminal claims made against people are true&mdash;except perhaps some people do in connection with Aboriginal people or people who are associated with Aboriginal people. That is just appalling. I do not believe that anyone, any reasonable person in this chamber or in the wider community, could possibly endorse that type of approach.

<PARA>We have been here for 200 years, for God's sake! A lot of those inadequacies in relation to Aboriginal people&mdash;whether they happen to be in health, employment, housing or education&mdash;and all of the appalling statistics which place them amongst the worst off people in the Third World reflect on successive governments in Australia over that period of 200 years, and I do not know why we should necessarily believe that ATSIC can fix them up in six years&mdash;as Senator Herron says&mdash;for God's sake!</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say that I am disappointed with the contributions to date of those opposite to this debate on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill. I am disappointed because I get the impression that they are opposing for the sake of opposing. This issue is far too important for them to not have addressed the basic issue before the House tonight. That basic issue is whether ATSIC is serving the Aboriginal community or not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only basic test that can be applied is whether the socioeconomic standing of Aboriginal communities since ATSIC was formed six years ago vis-a-vis the rest of Australia has improved, whether it has remained static or whether it has gone backwards. I suspect that not only has it remained static but the indications are that they have gone back somewhat. That is a disgrace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was part of the New South Wales Greiner government, which came into government in 1988. I was asked by the then Premier to administer the Office of Aboriginal Affairs and to look at the whole issue of land rights <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3099"> in New South Wales and at the whole issue of the wellbeing and welfare of the Aboriginal communities in New South Wales in particular. My first reaction was: why me? I had no interest in Aboriginal affairs, but the Premier thought that we should look at it from the point of view of management. As I owned a company prior to entering parliament and as I knew how to run a business, he thought I should look at it from a different point of view&mdash;from a business management point of view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recall going out into the communities throughout New South Wales and visiting them, trying to understand how they live and trying to understand why there was that bitterness and hatred towards anyone who came from the government or anyone who was white or anyone who tried to tell them how to run their affairs. What I found most interesting of all is that after I had had the meetings, when all of the angst would come out from them towards me, they would pull me aside and say, `I didn't mean the things I said. We know you want to help us, but why is it that we are not getting the money through? Where is the money going?' That was an interesting thing that I found was being directed at me repeatedly. They were saying, `We understand there is money in the kitty. People tell us there is X amount of money coming to us.' In the case of New South Wales, it was 7&half; per cent of the moneys collected through land tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here we have a situation where in the past six years the people of Australia have handed to ATSIC between $5 billion and $6 billion, between $5,000 million and $6,000 million. What happens to that amount of money? Where is it going? Do those who are most in need actually get it? I suspect that the answer is the same as the answer it was in New South Wales; that is, it goes in bloated administration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No-one on the other side said anything about these amendments but attacked the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) for their view of him, rightly or wrongly. Why did they not address the central issue which is before this parliament? That issue is the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> amendments to ATSIC that will make ATSIC a workable organisation from the point of view of ensuring that the Aborigines who are most in need get the maximum from those moneys.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are something like 18 or 20 amendments that I looked at in the last few weeks. One thing above all else surprised me from the contributions made by those opposite. They claim to have very strong contacts and links and love for the Aboriginal community, as I have as I came to understand them and as I came to understand the heartache, alienation and anger that they feel. They are saying something to us that obviously is not getting through to those opposite or that they choose to ignore for what I would not like to feel are political purposes. The major point you raised, the major point you kept repeating, was the question of the appointment of the chairman of ATSIC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not a secret that the Aboriginal communities are saying that they would like the chairman of ATSIC appointed. There is a good reason for that. It is not the sort of reason I want to raise or talk about in this parliament, but we on this side know the background and the reasons that have been put forward for the amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No mention was made of the tremendous advances made in specific instances by the Aboriginal community. I think it is a pity that those opposite chose to attack the government rather than give praise to the Aboriginal communities who have been able to succeed because an organisation has been put in place that has been working.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3100"> I make a comparison again to the Land Rights Act of New South Wales, where some regional councils are working well. I have seen a lot of examples of success stories. I recall visiting a panel beater. I recall visiting a company that was sold to the regional council up on the northern coast of New South Wales. I spoke to the Irish owner of the company who had agreed to stay with the company for 12 months to train the apprentices. I recall him saying to me, `We have four young Aborigines and they are the best young apprentices I have had in my 40 years in this trade.' They were given an opportuni ty; they grasped the opportunity, and they made a success of it. Additionally, with a committee that I was chairing at the time I visited Kakadu and Uluru. I spoke to the Aborigines who were managing those two national parks very well and very successfully. So there are success stories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point of&mdash;and the main reason for&mdash;these amendments is to ensure that everything possible is done to give the Aboriginal communities the right of self&hyphen;determination within the confines of an act that works well. I see the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) shaking his head in disbelief or disagreement&mdash;I am not quite sure which.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to put my experience in Aboriginal affairs up against that of anyone on the other side. I can say to you that I have seen a lot of suffering. I have seen a lot of Aborigines reaching out and asking, `What is going on? Why aren't things working for us?' The most important reason I have found is that we gave them a faulty structure with which to operate; a structure that they are not comfortable with, but a structure that was foisted upon them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to pay tribute tonight to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs: a man who I do not know very well, but a man that I am convinced is a decent, sensitive person who feels, like the rest of Australians, that we want to see the Aborigines achieve a better lifestyle. We want to see the Aborigines have hope in the future&mdash;hope for their children especially.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mention was made tonight of assimilation. I must say that, if anyone speaks about assimilation in our society, I will fight them to the very bitter end because there is nothing worse for any individual than to insist that they assimilate. Integration is different. You cannot make me into an Anglo&hyphen;Celt because that is not what I am. But I have integrated as a migrant. I think that one of the great stories about Australia is our bipartisan multicultural policy that has ensured that we can retain our identity whilst at the same time being part of a new Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very concerned that some of those opposite have made some comments, however sincere, regarding the reasons for these <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> amendments. The hour is late. I wanted to speak tonight to something like 20 or so amendments to the bill but I will not do it. I would just like to say to those opposite that, as far as I am concerned, everything that I see in the amendments is going to help the Aboriginal community. It is going to give those who administer Aboriginal affairs a framework from which to operate to ensure that the anomalies in the act are rectified. I must also say that I have been to many ministerial conferences on Aboriginal affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I spoke out against ATSIC, as I saw it six years ago, because I did not think it was going to help the Aboriginal community. It has not done very well. It can do better. The reason for these amendments is to provide the framework for the act to operate better than it has in the past. If there are amendments or changes that those opposite feel need to be considered, then they have to demonstrate that to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs and to those of us on this side of the House. I am certain that the minister will take that into consideration when a future occasion arises for amendments that will no doubt occur in ATSIC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In closing, I would hope that any other speakers on this issue will not adopt a line that will denigrate the most disadvantaged of Australians. I would hope that they will take into consideration the fact that for 200 years the Aborigines have not been treated very well. I hope that future speakers on the other side will make no effort at anything in regards to this bill other than to talk about the specific mechanics of the bill rather than resort to attacking individuals.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I listened to the insufferable hyperbole of previous speakers in this debate in this House, I found the last speaker&mdash;the honourable member for Lowe (Mr Zammit)&mdash;to be quite distasteful, being a classic in this category. In speaking to the ATSIC Amendment Bill, one has to consider the history of ATSIC. ATSIC was the creation of Gerry Hand, the then Aboriginal affairs minister. The architect of the bill was probably one Michael Dillon who works for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3101">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill was presented to the Labor Party Aboriginal affairs caucus committee. I strongly opposed it at the time, as did Senator Bob Collins and many of the other people who had an interest in Aboriginal affairs. Hand took the bill away, played with it, and amended it, and it eventually arrived in a form that was accepted generally by the committee. I still believed that it would not work, and I did not vote for the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I asked Robert Tickner, when he was Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, about some particular function, all he said was: `I don't have any power as minister. The power resides with ATSIC and with Keating.' As minister, he completely absolved himself of any responsibility. I do think the present ATSIC bill does not give the minister enough power. Certainly Tickner was not one to stand up to either Keating or to ATSIC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the reasons given for the need for ATSIC was the fact that the Department of Aboriginal Affairs was terribly top heavy in Canberra. There were too many bureaucrats in Canberra, and I think there were. The idea was that ATSIC was going to get the bureaucrats out into the regions. There are now twice as many bureaucrats in Canberra. ATSIC clearly has not been successful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People talk about an Aboriginal problem. There is no Aboriginal problem; there are thousands of different problems. They are broken up into three main areas&mdash;community, fringe dwellers and urban Aboriginals. The category of urban Aboriginals is by far the biggest. Despite the fact that I probably represent more Aboriginals in this place than any other member, there are more Aboriginals in the western suburbs of Sydney than in my electorate. These people are very hard to reach. They are locked into internecine warfare. There is inadequate housing, there are a lot of alcohol problems, there are low levels of education and there are low levels of employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fringe dweller problem is being tackled variously and with varying degrees of success. We have thrown enormous funds at the communities. One might think things were <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> getting better, although in the years I have been in parliament I find this hard to believe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is talk about Aboriginal aspirations. I find that a lot of members talk glibly about Aboriginal aspirations. I have dealt with a lot of Aboriginals and I find that their aspirations are very much like the aspirations of everyone else. They want a future for their kids. They want a fair go. They want good representation. They feel that they are not getting it. I think they are absolutely right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We hear a lot of emotional nonsense in this place about land. In my electorate, in an off&hyphen;pay week many of them would sell their land for a corned beef sandwich. Land is not the genesis or the answer. If you look at Aboriginal history in Australia, those Aboriginals who have been alienated from the land the longest have the highest standard of living, the highest per capita income and live the longest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problems are, in my view, housing, hygiene, health, education, training and employment. If you leave out one of those things, the whole thing collapses. The whole edifice collapses if you miss just one. Yet we continue to address this in a piecemeal fashion. I can tell honourable members that, if you are serious about Aboriginal health, you don't want more doctors but more hygiene. You cannot get more hygiene unless you get adequate housing, and that is not happening. It could happen. It could happen very quickly. But it is not happening and will not happen under the present structure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We then hear about Aboriginal culture. What we have done in Australia, particularly with respect to urban Aboriginals, is that we have taken the extended family as an example of Aboriginal culture. The extended family is an economic defence mechanism adopted by anyone under economic pressure. It was the same for the Irish in Britain 200 years ago. It is the same for any group in Australia&mdash;Lebanese or anyone else. The extended family makes economic sense. We have institutionalised poverty culture and called it Aboriginal culture and for many Aboriginals there is simply no way out of this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know how many times I have seen self-determination used as a strategy for doing <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3102"> nothing. I have been to ATSIC and to the old department and pointed out clear abuse of the system. At first it is so often denied and then they say to me, `Oh, yes, but they have self-determination. We cannot do anything until they make up their mind.' That is an impossible situation. Self-determination is a myth and most Aboriginal people understand that it is a myth. It is something that is used by the system to perpetuate itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me turn to the out-station movement. When Gerry Hand was the Aboriginal affairs minister, $5 million was allocated to out-stations around Balga. People at Balga saw me and said, `We don't want these out-stations. There is probably only room for one. What we want are facilities in the town. We want better conditions and amenities here.' But no. The thinking of the bureaucracy was for out-stations, so they got out-stations. Only one out&hyphen;station is being utilised; the rest are abandoned, despite a lot of infrastructure being put in place. A lot of cost was imposed on the state governments but consultation with the local community was never considered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many reasons for out-stations. Sometimes they are supported on the basis that they improve health, and in the short term this often happens. There is a short&hyphen;term improvement in health but then health takes a significant nosedive. That is the situation for just about every out-station I am aware of. There are many reasons for having out&hyphen;stations. One reason is that it is simply an escape from those who have the power. This was certainly a big reason in the Northern Territory. However, there is very strong recognition by Aboriginal people that they need better conditions and amenities in the larger areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real problem with accountability is this: we have forced upon ATSIC a very strenuous regime of accountability. If there are any minor lapses, they cop the full weight of accountability. The problem is that there is no accountability in the middle levels of ATSIC. So what you find is that, when ATSIC makes money available to communities without any real advice or ongoing advice and the communities stuff up, as just about any society <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> would, ATSIC then wax lyrical about accountability when what they should have had was some ongoing education the whole time. But that has not happened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We just had a situation where, in the name of accountability, the minister sacked a commissioner, Guy Parker. I know Guy Parker well; I have had a lot of fights with him. Guy Parker's problem was that he cashed a cheque when there were no funds to meet it. At the time Guy Parker was having trouble with his wife, problems some of us know about. His arrangement was to transfer money from one account to another. The money was clearly in the other account. His wife did not do it. He got caught. I think it was very foolish of the minister to take this high&hyphen;handed action when it had nothing to do with ATSIC funds. While I have had a lot of arguments with Guy Parker, I believe that Guy Parker was a man who encouraged his people to get out and do things for themselves and take responsibility for their own actions. He will be a loss, and I think it will set back Aboriginal development in that area of the Pilbara quite considerably.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Reconciliation is another cherished notion. Aboriginals say to me, `What is this reconciliation business; that's about the past, isn't it? The past has gone.' That is very profound. They say, `We have to think about the future. We have to get on together.' They see that as the only future, getting on together. They see reconciliation as dredging up the past and dredging up the whole guilt industry. The two great things holding back Aboriginal development in this country are the concept of white guilt and the concept of black shame. Until Aboriginal people can come to grips with those concepts and until the wider community can come to grips with the concept of guilt, I think that Aboriginal progress will be very slow indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the members mentioned some notable people&mdash;Viner, Chaney, Puplick and Mick Dodson. Certainly the first three were very prominent members of the Liberal Party. I believe that they are part of the problem. They are in the same category as the Nugents and the Zammits of this parliament. They have no real understanding. They have large <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3103"> doses of guilt&mdash;not their guilt, of course, our guilt. I think this is something that we will have to come to grips with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support this bill, although not because it is a good bill. It is not; it is a very pedestrian bill. It has no real vision, but it seems to me that it will be very hard to do anything with this monstrosity in ATSIC that we have created. There is, in my view, however, a function for a body such as ATSIC. It should be a very small, specialised department, making sure that Aboriginals receive services in the mainstream. I believe that most of these services will come from the mainstream. It is not happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the central reserve&mdash;that area that lies between Kalgoorlie and Alice Springs&mdash;where there is a large concentration of Aboriginal people, many of the most tribal people have left. We have been providing education out there for 40 years. It would be cheaper to send every Aboriginal child to the most expensive boarding schools in Perth. We are out there pouring in the infrastructure and putting in the teachers. These are first&hyphen;rate facilities. We have not got one Aboriginal kid to year 12 in 40 years. That is not a great effort.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An Aboriginal woman recently approached me and said, `Our kids aren't getting education because they don't go to school and you don't care. If they were white kids, you'd make them go to school.' I explained to her that we made the white kids go to school because we did not care. We said, `That is the law and you are going to school.' We were so frightened of their culture that we dared not do it to them. She said, `Well, that's a lot of nonsense. It's our kids that need the education.' But if you were to mention putting in a hostel in these areas, shock horror, back to the mission days! How paternalistic! The fact that that is what they are seeking does not seem to interest anyone. In those areas we have allowed football matches to become cultural events. Football matches in some of these areas take a week&mdash;two days to get there, two days to get back and two days to play the game and get over it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a situation where Aboriginals are not getting their schooling. In the town areas <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> you find that there is quite a good school attendance amongst female Aboriginals. They do not get subjected to quite the same peer group pressure. Even they realise that there is not much real job prospect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If any Aboriginal wants a job with a mining company in Kalgoorlie, I will get him or her a job with a mining company. But the mining company legally cannot employ them unless they speak and read English. That is a breach of the mining act. It cannot employ them if they are not prepared to do shift work. It cannot employ them if they don't turn up to work and it cannot employ them if they do not turn up to work neat and tidy. They cannot meet those conditions because in most cases there is no accommodation for them. But the potential is there if we can put in the necessary infrastructure to bridge that. I believe that we can make some progress. I am actually having talks with some Aboriginal people. I am hoping that next week  we will announce a plan and see what Aboriginal self-help can do that government, in all these years, has failed to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill does not really change much at all. I happen to have the view that the minister should be able to appoint the chairman. I think that is quite reasonable. I found a lot of agreement from Aboriginals in that regard. Even so, one gets the feeling that we are only moving the deckchairs and nothing much will change. I do not believe it will change until there is a complete review of our regard&mdash;what we actually want.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I often ask myself what the Aboriginal affairs policy is for. Is it to advance the cause of Aboriginal people? If it is, it has been very expensive and certainly not very successful. Is it, on the other hand, to placate affluent urban white middle-class guilt? In that case, it has been enormously successful. We are now at the backlash stage. People are saying, `After all we've done, nothing is happening.' I put it to members that that is not the fault of the Aboriginal people; it is the fault of the Aboriginal industry. I can tell you now there are black bureaucrats every bit as bureaucratic as white bureaucrats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I see in Aboriginal affairs I find very depressing. The Derby branch of ATSIC has <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3104"> for a long time really been a subset of the Kimberley Land Council, a body that has very little local support. It has only 118 members. Many people do not even know they are members! At a meeting today, I was told by ATSIC that they had been aware of this problem for over a year. They acted on it yesterday. In the meantime, there are many good communities that would not buckle to the KLC, that had been intimidated, had their funds withdrawn and were generally harassed. They are good communities, communities who have been out there trying to do something for themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Noonkanbah is a classic case. Noonkanbah is a community I know well. They had an Aboriginal bookkeeper who did a very good job. Unfortunately, his wife got sick and he went down to Perth to be with his wife. A substitute was put in who did not really know the ropes, but there was no ATSIC attempt to help. No-one said, `Look, let's give you some assistance here.' He did make a mess of the books. There was no stealing of funds at all; there was just inadequate capacity for book work. Harry came back to Noonkanbah and rectified the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the problem is at least a year old now, but ATSIC have felt compelled to put in a grant controller and they will not release any money from Noonkanbah unless they accept the grant controller&mdash;something which the community feels is demeaning and unnecessary as they have sorted out their problem. But ATSIC explained to me they are bound by the rules and, although they recognise that the problem is actually very minor, the full draconian weight of accountability falls upon this community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You also see this situation in Aboriginal stations. ATSIC money is given very late in the year&mdash;often too late to be acquitted. Aboriginal communities often then get in white contractors because they know they cannot do the work in time. Our reaction is, `Those lazy so-and-sos, look, they get the gudia to do the work for them.' That is because it is a necessity. If they do not, the money has to go back or it is simply rolled over, and the money churns around and around.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A place like Noonkanbah should have had 2,000 breeders years ago, but if it had it would be self-sufficient and it would not want ATSIC. One often wonders whether that is the reason it has never had the support. That is just one example. I can cite example after example.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might just close by saying the Goldfields Land Council is where most multiple land claims are arising. That land council is desperately trying to coordinate and do a good job. It is desperately trying to fend off the enormous backlog that is going to descend upon us, because there is no doubt that native title is going to be a disaster for the goldmining industry. It is already happening. We are not finding the million ounces a month we need to continue productivity, but governments from both sides are simply failing to recognise it.</PARA></SPEECH>

It is intelligent, resourceful and a long way from any of the problems that the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) represents, but I can assure you that within my own electorate there is a considerable degree of concern for the welfare of indigenous Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I knew nothing about Aboriginal affairs and Aboriginal issues until about four years ago, and I still have a great deal to learn. I remember the first meeting I had with the late Fred Hollows in March 1992. He said to me, `You'll probably be the next President of the AMA.' I said, `What? Are you doing my numbers?' He said, `If you get there, there are two things that you have got to do.' I said, `What's that?' He said, `The first is that you have to liberalise the AMA's attitudes to Medicare.' I said, `You had better give me the second. I hope it's easier than the first.' He said, `Well, you must do everything that you possibly can to work for the betterment of the health and welfare of Aboriginal people.' <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3105"> After listening to maiden speeches in this place, I think that is what I and a number of other people are committed to doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember my first trip to the Northern Territory. I had been there about a week and I took a team of doctors, leaders of various medical groups, out there. I must have met and spoken to over 500 Aboriginal people in the space of a week. I recall returning and speaking to the then Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, the Hon. Robert Tickner, a man whose ability never matched his sincerity. I said, `I think there's a problem with ATSIC. I have just spoken to, I think, some 500 Aboriginal people. I haven't met a single person who could say anything positive about ATSIC.' In fact, even ATSIC regional councillors were criticising ATSIC. Whilst there will always be critics of any organisation, particularly a semi-government body, you know you have a problem when that happens. The minister's response to me was, `Look, Brendan, this is what self-determination is all about. I am not responsible. It's ATSIC's responsibility.' Therein lies the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Graham Richardson was the health minister, he went to the Kimberleys with <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS>. He gave us another glimpse of the problem when he was asked by Charles Woolley why, after 11 years in government, the situation was still so bad. He said, `I've spent a lifetime reading polls, and concern for Aboriginal people is not in the top million issues worrying the voters.' The problem is that when the buck does not stop with the minister, no matter how well&hyphen;intentioned our efforts may be, very little happens.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">meant that an unwieldy, undemocratic and unworkable political structure was created. It was not permitted or encouraged to devise integrated plans for communities or families. Both the political and the administrative structures found themselves <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> standing on functional mountains, giving out money for specific purposes to scads of incorporated bodies, themselves both short on administrative expertise and having problems of accounting to their own constituencies. The glory of ATSIC, from Labor's point of view, was that when anything was wrong in an Aboriginal community, the minister could shake his head and explain it was not his fault. The priorities were set by ATSIC and they divvied up the cake. It was usually done with such skill that no&hyphen;one ever looked at the size of the cake. It was different once. As Ian Viner or Fred Chaney or Peter Baume could attest, there was a time when a Minister for Aboriginal Affairs was under personal assault for each and every problem that was uncovered. Wittingly or not, John Herron and John Howard may have restored this situation.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill changes the nature of regional councils; it reduces their size; it makes open to public scrutiny meetings and documents. It empowers the Australian Electoral Commission to have more authority over the way in which elections are held. It also provides for the power to appoint an administrator. But in order for that to be done the minister has to be satisfied that the administration of the commission and of its money have involved fraud or gross mismanagement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Speakers on the other side of the chamber are no less or more well intentioned than those on this side. But what they have failed to recognise&mdash;and what I think the previous minister failed to recognise&mdash;is that there has been a change in mood in the Australian community generally. There is now finally&mdash;perhaps, in some small way, due to the efforts of Graham Richardson and others&mdash;a higher political priority placed on both the problems and the progress. With these rising expectations has come a significant degree of frustration. The worst thing that any government&mdash;whether it be our government or the Keating government, had it won the election&mdash;could have done for indigenous Australians would have been to have allowed it to continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The support that the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) achieved&mdash;despite the member having views to which I take strong exception&mdash;is a signal and a message that we ignore at our own peril; that is, that people had just about had enough. The member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) is quite right in saying that this approach is not the solution <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3106"> to Aboriginal problems, and none of us on this side are foolish enough to think that it is. But it is a move in the right direction. If we don't have political support behind us, this parliament may well have significantly more people who hold the same views as those held by the member for Oxley. In my opinion, such people would not be interested in seeing significant positive changes made in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many other things that I would like to say. I visited one community&mdash;I will not name it&mdash;in the Top End where things were terrible. There were 43 people living in a three&hyphen;bedroom house with one toilet. There were many people without housing. The member for Kalgoorlie looks after many similar communities. I said to the president of the community, `Was it always like this?' He replied, `No, we used to have a market garden. We used to have dwellings that were respectable and health was generally pretty good.' I said, `What happened?' He replied, `It all stopped when Gough Whitlam started sending what we call sit down money.' Therein lies another essential message&mdash;this is not the solution in itself to indigenous problems&mdash;that, whatever we do, we have to do everything we can to help people to help themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In concluding, I would like to read one of the recommendations from the report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The third prerequisite of the empowerment of Aboriginal people in their communities is having a place, an established method, a procedure whereby the broader society can supply the assistance referred to and the Aboriginal society can receive it whilst, at the same time, maintaining its independent status and without a welfare dependent position being established as between the two groups. This requires an adherence to the principles of self&hyphen;determination.</PARA>
<PARA>These are not things that we are interfering with this legislation. Also pertinent to this bill is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That ATSIC councillors and commissioners at an early stage be encouraged to consult with Aboriginal organisations and communities to develop a program for training staff of Aboriginal organisations and communities in appropriate management and accounting procedures to ensure the efficiency and integrity of the organisations which are cultur <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> ally appropriate. In particular, there should be a commitment to devising management procedures which provide rules for the relationship obligations and rights&mdash;both individually and as between each other&mdash;of directors, managers and staff of Aboriginal organisations.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;In the very short time left for the debate on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill, I would like to try to draw a few things together. I apologise to the opposition for the difficulty in the timing of this. We had been in opposition for 8&half; years, and the last day of the sitting timetable is often very difficult. I do not think that we can take all the blame for that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to acknowledge the contributions by the speakers in this debate. I am sorry I was not able to be present in the House, but I was able to catch much of what many people said. I particularly acknowledge the contribution of the member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding), who is still in the chamber. If we had been able to have more of those types of speeches by members on both sides of the House in the last 10 or 15 years, we might have done a bit more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also acknowledge the contribution of the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), whom, in terms of representation and practical, on&hyphen;the&hyphen;ground experience, you cannot ignore; nor can you doubt his commitment. Even if you do not agree with what he says, his commitment is unquestionable. One thing I should pick up on is his talk of guilt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I actually do not think guilt is what drives a lot of people. I think it is a frustration and a desire to see something get better and hope that what we will do will make things better. But there is the frustration that they do not seem to be improving much. The debate tonight shows the difficulty in this area; there were a whole range of opinions expressed by those on all sides of the House and there was a bit of truth in all of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I became shadow minister in 1990 I was told by a former minister, Fred Chaney, that the job would change me. It certainly did, and that is what the former minister and I share from different sides of the House.</PARA>

<TIME.STAMP>(10.01 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to speak on this bill and I welcome all the members of the public who have gathered here this morning to hear my contribution on this bill. I want to say at the outset that, if the former government had introduced a bill with the purposes of this bill, that is, having first attempted to remove a board, introducing a bill to increase the number of board members, we would have been subject to a great deal of criticism, if not outrage, about our tactics. But this is precisely what the bill proposes to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have suggested that there is a degree of double standards in this bill, but the opposition is not going to oppose it, Mr Deputy Speaker. You might ask why not. Basically, the issue of air safety is such a serious one that no party, whether in government or in opposition, would wish to be held accountable for the obstruction of a change process, which at some point or another may lead to a calamity. So, in a sense, as is usual in government, it is on the head of the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, Mr Sharp, to accept responsibility for these changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the amendment moved by my colleague the shadow minister, the member for Melbourne, Lindsay Tanner, we specifically say that no person should be appointed to the board who has engaged recently in political lobbying or public advocacy on aviation safety issues on behalf of any company or interest group involved in the aviation industry. Frankly, that section of the amendment could be described as the `get Dick Smith amendment'. I do not believe this is moved by personal animus but rather that someone who has taken such a high profile and partisan approach to air safety should not be part of the minister's endeavours to increase the board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know of a couple of the members of the existing board. Bill Fisher is the head of the Industrial Relations Commission in New South Wales. I have had the pleasure of meeting Gabi Hollows in my electorate and I think she is a first&hyphen;class person to be a consumer advocate. I think it is important that we have a consumer representative. Of course, we have two other <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3111"> members with specific expertise on the board in relation to air safety. Claire Pollock is a systems safety expert and Geoff Molloy is an ex&hyphen;pilot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my own electorate, issues of civil aviation and air safety are of some concern to my constituents. You may recall that the former government split the old civil aviation body into two. It structurally separated Airservices Australia, which, if you like, is the operating arm, from CASA, the safety arm. I think that that was a very good move, probably long overdue. We tend in government to set up boards and statutory authorities and sometimes corporations which we invest with a great deal of independence. We believe that they should get on and do their job impartially and that there should be some distance between those bodies and the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I have to say that politics these days, or society, does not allow us that luxury. Because no matter how much the particular organisation is independent, inevitably it is the minister who ends up wearing any untoward experiences. I could use a more colourful word. But I have observed, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;and I know other members have observed&mdash;your very strict standards and I will resist any temptation to use such a word in conjunction with fans! So what I am saying about this bill is that Minister Sharp firstly sought to get the resignations of board members and failed, and now is introducing this bill to increase the number of board members. I do not know that we approve of the approach he is adopting, but we are certainly not going to oppose it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned that my constituents are very interested in matters of civil aviation. For example, during the last election there was quite some concern that Airservices Australia had failed to deliver the possible flight paths for Badgerys Creek airport. I think that failure, and other issues associated with Badgerys Creek, cost me and some of my colleagues dearly in the last election. I must say that whilst I am supporting the minister in relation to this bill&mdash;as the opposition is&mdash;I cannot say that I am supporting him in relation to other matters in his portfolio area having to do with civil aviation in my electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, I find it really regrettable that, more than 100 days after the election, with more than 10 per cent of the government's time having expired before the next election is due, my constituents are no better informed about Badgerys Creek than they were before the election. We have yet to see any draft guidelines for the environmental impact statement, even though we extended the date for public submissions for those guidelines from 1 March to 1 April and they were due to be released in May. Here we are at the end of June and the draft guidelines have not been produced. We do not know what the public process of comment on those draft guidelines will be. We do not know the locations of public consultation about those draft guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, in relation to civil aviation matters in my electorate, during the last election the then government had given a commitment to set up an advising committee&mdash;one comprised of experts, but also of locals&mdash;to sit between the EIS process and the ministers. We have had no announcement of a commitment by the new government to such a body, much less the names of the people who might serve on such a committee. As I reminded the minister on my way to the House, in a way the new government has the same problem as the old government. That is, the public have to have confidence in the EIS for Badgerys Creek.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must have a rigorous EIS process so that whatever the outcome, whether it is in favour of the airport or opposed to it, people will accept the EIS verdict. I certainly want to be in that position. I am certainly interested in any suggestions that strengthen that process and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3112"> would give greater credibility to the outcome of that process. But as I said to the minister, `The delay is costing you.' As each day slips by and people are no better informed, it diminishes the chances that that process will be believed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say a couple of other things. It is true to say that almost every portfolio minister has reported in some way on the prospects of cuts in his portfolio area. In relation to transport and the environment, if we are to have a credible EIS process the government is going to have to invest some money in public consultation, informing people and allowing people to be satisfied that the process is fair and reasonable, and&mdash;even more than that&mdash;allowing them direct input into the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Public consultation delays things. Public consultation involves extra expenditure. I sincerely hope that, in relation to the EIS process, there will be no trying to save expenditure here. In saving money, the minister could very well be penny&hyphen;wise and pound&hyphen;foolish, as they say. On behalf of my constituents who, as I have said, are exhibiting a great deal of interest in civil aviation matters, I sincerely hope that the government will stop stonewalling on the EIS process, that it will commit to releasing the draft EIS, release the schedule of public consultation about the draft EIS and the rest of the EIS process, and also nominate the locations and the timings at which ordinary people in my electorate and in others affected by Badgerys Creek will be allowed to inform themselves and, in turn, have input into the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, to a degree there are double standards about this bill. If we had tried to sack a board or get a board to resign when we were in government, we would be have been lampooned by the press and the public. If we had attempted to introduce legislation like this to expand the board and had specifically tried to target one member of the public who was a partisan to be a new member of that board&mdash;or, indeed, to be deputy chairman of that board&mdash;again, we would have been lampooned. As I mentioned earlier, civil aviation is a very serious issue. I do not believe that any party, particularly the Labor Party as the opposition, wishes to accept responsibility in any way for any adverse outcome that may, down the track, devolve as a result of this bill and the transport minister's decision.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the amendment to the second reading motion on the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 1996 which was moved by Mr Tanner, and I will say a few things on that matter. I will also speak about some general matters on the administration of civil aviation in this country, particularly as it relates to Sydney.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I join with the member for Chifley (Mr Price) in what he has just said about the probity of the government in introducing this legislation. The absolutely outrageous pressure that the government has put on Mr Justice Fisher, who is the Chairman of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, to resign has been unconscionable, in my view. The government seems to have taken the view that it should just politicise all these things. Mr Justice Fisher is a person of eminent standing and is the chief judge of the labour court in New South Wales. Before that, he was a very successful Queen's Counsel in Sydney. He is a man whose judgment is respected by all those who know him, and he is a person who is not engaged in partisan political activities, which are particularly precluded by his job as a judge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is about the government wanting to sack Mr Justice Fisher and put one of their political stooges into this job: a fellow who spent a fortune putting out ads for the government in the last election campaign, and who is the discredited former chairman of the old board that ran civil aviation in this country for some years. He is the man who came forward with the discredited proposition of `affordable safety': Dick Smith. Dick Smith, whom <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3113"> this bill is all about, is a fellow who has no credibility in this. He is a fellow who has spent a lot of time talking about how he is the voice of aviation.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He is the voice of people who want to fly helicopters around the suburbs, and he is the voice of small aircraft operators, but he is certainly not the voice of the travelling public. Indeed, the travelling public in Australia does not at all like the idea of affordable safety.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure members of this parliament, along with the business community of Australia, probably spend the greatest proportion of time travelling in aeroplanes, and the thought that there is a concept such as affordable safety is a pretty terrifying one. But that is what Mr Smith's idea was: that we should let all these things rip. While Mr Smith was able to say that there were very few airline crashes when he was the chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority, I think the difficulties we have had with air safety, with commuter operators, is a direct outgrowth of Mr Smith's discredited policy of affordable safety.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Smith's argument was that we ought to let it rip; let small operators get out there and run their businesses. That ethos that filtered down in the civil aviation area and allowed for some of these more tragic occurrences in the commuter area is a direct result of the attitude that Dick Smith had when he was the supremo of the civil aviation area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members on the other side might say that he was an appointment of ours. Yes, he was an appointment of ours. We put him on the board and then we made him chairman. If you speak to Senator Collins, who was the minister at the time, he will tell you that it took him about 15 minutes after that to work out that Dick Smith was probably the worst chairman that we ever had. He made a number of entreaties to Mr Smith that he ought to resign and it is quite well known that the government of the day was not all that happy with Mr Smith as the chairman of that body. We did not bring in a bill to undermine him. We let him run his course and we never reappointed him. We did not bring in a bill to rearrange the board, to put someone in to look over Mr Smith's shoulder. If the government wants to do that to Justice Fisher, that is its prerogative, but it should not come in here with this sleazy tactic of expanding the board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government talks about jobs for the boys, for goodness sake! Dick Smith is a corporate member of the Liberal Party. This is a fellow who spent a lot of his own money in the last elections putting ads in the paper for the Liberal Party. You do not get much more commitment to a party than that, where someone actually shells out their own money for big ads in the paper. But the government says, `Dick Smith? Don't think we've heard of him. We've seen a bit of him in the paper; knows a lot about aviation.' Dick Smith knows far more about the Liberal Party than he knows about aviation. The government wants to go and corrupt this body by expanding it to put its political mates on it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the second reading amendment being put forward by Mr Tanner is the one that ought to be followed if the government is serious in what it says it wants to do about the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. Mr Tanner's amendment states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House is of the opinion that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> it is appropriate that the Board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority should include members in areas such as the law, regulation and general systems safety, as well as members with specific expertise in aviation . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, that is the way the board is constructed now. There are people who represent the travelling public, who probably ought to have a bit of a say in what happens with the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. There is a very eminent judge in Justice Fisher. There is a person <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3114"> who has very significant experience in large jets as well as the small weekenders that Mr Smith has some expertise in. We think the board at present is a fairly well constituted board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The important thing which is raised in the second paragraph of Mr Tanner's amendment is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">no person should be appointed to the Board who has engaged recently in political lobbying or public advocacy on aviation safety issues on behalf of any company or interest group involved in the aviation industry.</PARA>
<PARA>I suppose Mr Tanner is being quite generous there in not suggesting Mr Smith's other interest, which is the Liberal Party of Australia. I think the parliament should think very carefully about whether we want to have the discredited Dick Smith back on the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and whether we want the discredited Dick Smith running his old discredited line again of affordable safety.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no such thing as affordable safety. In Australia we have been very lucky in this area. There have been few significant aviation disasters. Some people would tell you that that is a function of the weather here and the lack of congestion in the airways as much as it is the work of the civil aviation bureaucracy. I think that what we want in that bureaucracy are people who are going to put safety to the forefront.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also wish to say a few things about the way civil aviation has degenerated in the Sydney basin since the government came to office. We saw the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in the election campaign, for blatant political purposes, decide that they were going to let not 1,000 flowers bloom but 1,000 planes fly anywhere and everywhere that they wanted to over the Sydney basin. Then, the week after the election, we had revealed this deal that seems to have been done with some obscure group that wishes to promote an airport at Holsworthy. In all the competitions or considerations that have been held over the previous years as to where a second airport for Sydney should be built, Holsworthy had always come in second or third last. Now we have the government promoting it to being second best.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It raises interesting questions about what this airport might be like because Holsworthy is an area that has great amounts of unexploded ordnance on the site and it is also an area that has very deep ravines and river valleys. One of the reasons that the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) gave as to why he thought Holsworthy should be given consideration and why he thought Badgerys Creek was not terrific was that there were rolling hills at Badgerys Creek.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have gone from a situation where an airport site is given a downgrading in the minister's eyes because it has a rolling hills topography to one where a site that is full of ravines becomes popular all of a sudden. It just boggles the mind. I do not know; maybe the government has some new technology that will enable it to develop a machine that will explode all the unexploded bombs on the firing range there and which will blow all the dirt into the ravines so that with one big bang it will have flattened out the Holsworthy area. Unless the government has something like that in mind, then just the engineering task for turning Holsworthy into an airport is daunting, to say the least.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also the difficulty that it will cause to the residents who live around that Holsworthy area. They all went to the election reading about the big aircraft noise debate in Sydney and thinking, `Well, with all these maps that have been drawn, we are pretty safe. No&hyphen;one is talking about putting an airport in my backyard.' They then got rid of Bob Tickner because they were feeling pretty safe out there in those nice little new suburbs like Wattle Grove. Then the week <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3115"> after the election they found there was a confidence trick&mdash;that the Prime Minister was not thinking about putting an airport out at Badgerys Creek; but there was this proposal for Holsworthy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It turns out that these people had been to see the Prime Minister before the election. This is the Prime Minister who was going to bring honesty and probity back into the political system. But did we get one whisper of this during the election campaign? Not on your nelly, because they did not want the truth to get in the way of beating Bob Tickner in Hughes. We never heard the new member for Hughes, Danna Vale, saying anything about this during the election campaign&mdash;not a word. The people who bought houses out in Wattle Grove have just lost tens of thousands of dollars from the value of their houses. No&hyphen;one in their right mind would buy a house there now. The government has tainted that area for quite some time because of its proposals to allow those real estate sharks who are behind the Lawrence Hargraves project to come out there, hoping to build an airport at Holsworthy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also during the election campaign, we heard a few other mistruths told around the place. I remember reading in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> that the Prime Minister was never going to let planes fly over the Lowe electorate. The people of Lowe had a choice: if they wanted no more aircraft noise, the simple choice was to vote for Mr Zammit; if they wanted aircraft noise, they should keep voting for Mrs Easson. If they wanted their property values to go up, they should vote for Zammit; if they wanted aircraft noise, they should vote for Easson. Unfortunately, the people of Lowe did vote for Mr Zammit. A great number of those people voted for Mr Zammit because they believed the Prime Minister when he said that there would not be planes flying over the electorate of Lowe under a Liberal Party government. They voted for him for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what has happened since then? We have let the thousand aircraft fly. On Saturday last, the Federal Airports Corporation's inquiry unit received nearly 400 complaints about aircraft noise in Sydney. Most of those were complaints about northerly and westerly departures. On Sunday of last week, before 5 p.m. it had received nearly 300 complaints. There are new noise hot spots occurring around Sydney now. Suburbs such as Dulwich Hill, Summer Hill, Ashfield, Concord, Petersham, Lewisham, Earlwood, Arncliffe, Haberfield and Bexley never used to experience aircraft noise, but they are now getting it on a daily basis. Currently around Sydney there are no designated flight paths. Planes taking off to the north have only to fly four nautical miles before they can turn and fly wherever they like.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I do not think many of those pilots or the people in the control tower heard what the Prime Minister said. I really do not think they did, because you have got a lot of planes flying over Haberfield, Croydon, Burwood and Strathfield in the electorate of Lowe. There are a lot of people complaining. I know, because my electorate is next&hyphen;door, and I get the complaints from them when they have rung Mr Zammit and he has given them a mealy&hyphen;mouthed explanation about not knowing that this was going to happen because John Howard said it would not happen. They ring my office and complain about these things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So much for the promise made to the people of Lowe that there would be no more planes flying over Lowe, and so much for the lack of information given to the people of Wattle Grove when they concealed this idea to build an airport next to where they live. The government does not have very clean hands on this aircraft business in the Sydney basin. What we really need to see is the government, rather than just letting these planes fly everywhere, starting to give <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3116"> some cogent view of what we should be doing with Sydney airport and with the air transportation needs of the city of Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The great worry that I have now is that we are going to see the EIS for Badgerys Creek fall over. There is no doubt in any way, shape or form that an EIS for Holsworthy will fall over. And, in six or eight months time, we will find ourselves with no alternative site for an airport in Sydney&mdash;no site. The government will think that is pretty good, because they will tip back into the general revenue fund the money that we allocated in the budget for work at Badgerys Creek and say, `We've taken $600 million off the bottom line&mdash;and it wasn't really our fault because the EIS fell down.' But, after 10 or 15 years of planning, we will not have a site.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will be back to where Malcolm Fraser was when he got the report of the study on the major airport needs of Sydney. We will be back to Sydney airport, no other site, and absolute chaos for the people who live south of Sydney Harbour. The reality is that if you do not have an alternate site constructed shortly, Sydney airport will meet its capacity and you will have to do away with the curfew, you will have to do away with the cap of 80 movements an hour that the Labor government put on this airport, and you will also ensure that commuters who come from country New South Wales will not have any service into Sydney airport at all. They will have none because the government will sell these slots at the airport for landings and the pressure for the use of the airport from the major operators will keep country commuters out. What we will have in a few years time will be an impossible situation at Sydney airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the government really needs to start to think about this seriously and not get themselves caught up in the politics of: `We think the Labor Party hurt us, so we are now going to hurt Labor voters.' They probably ought, in the first instance, to stop hurting the people who voted for them&mdash;the people in Lowe and out in Hughes. And they certainly should not put a discredited person such as Dick Smith on this board. They should leave the people on the board alone so that they can do the job they were appointed to do.</PARA></SPEECH>

<ELECTORATE> (Shortland)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(10.34 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Civil Aviation Amendment Bill is a very small bill, with few words, but it is a bill of great significance. I have to say that, with all of my experience in relation to aviation matters and aviation safety matters, I am deeply concerned at what I see happening in aviation safety since the change in government. I fear for the minister, with whom I have a very good relationship and with whom I have worked very closely over a number of years. I will go through it as quickly as I can in the time I have available to me to set out the grounds for my fears at the course I see being undertaken.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill itself, as introduced by the minister, simply expands the membership of the board. That is not a problem. A board can be any size you want it to be. I do not see any problem with that. The board could have been six, seven, nine, or whatever&mdash;that is not a problem. What concerns me is the manner in which it is being done. And what concerns me more than anything else is what is behind all of this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that when we looked at the legislation last year that set up the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, the now minister was asking questions and&mdash;I did not realise it at the time&mdash;he was pressing for more information on the powers of the minister to sack members of the board. Page 43 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> transcript for 26 April last year shows that he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How can it be made more accountable to him if, at the end of the day, the minister may be able to dismiss people for noncompliance? I think it is a basic failure. If it is to be accountable, the minister must have the power to do what he ultimately feels is important, yet you are telling me he cannot quite do that. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3117">  </PARA>
<PARA>And so it goes on&mdash;for those who want to look through it in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> . It worries me that this legislation is before us now and that those thoughts were in the minister's head at that time. It is very clear that, regardless of who the members of the board who were subsequently appointed were to be, he had in mind that, were there to be a change in government, he wanted to have the power to sack the board. That is not Morris's opinion; it is simply there in the transcript where  it is set out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we also turn to his second reading speech, he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The addition of the Board of two extra members with aviation experience will increase aviation safety in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>What experience? In the industry, the last person you want to put in to manage an airline operation is a pilot. Pilots are highly trained, highly specialised individuals operating a public conveyance&mdash;a piece of transport equipment. You show me an organisation in the world&mdash;a successful one&mdash;that has a pilot as the manager.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What you need on a board is a group of dispassionate people who are skilled in particular fields and who are able to assess the information brought forward from specialists in the field&mdash;and this is a highly technical field. You need people who are able to dispassionately look at the facts and information. Behind all this is not somebody's indulgence: this is about public safety, the most important area of public safety in this country. That is why I am so gravely concerned at what I see happening, and it is why I am concerned for the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What kind of experience will there be? It is not detailed. The minister says that aviation is a complex and detailed industry that requires people to administer it who have `appropriate qualifications'. What qualifications? I refer to the words of the Chief Opposition Whip, the member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay), who has just left us. I will leave them unspoken. Go back and think about his words, `What qualifications?' The qualifications are unspoken, not spoken of in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> last year in what was there. Can we be confident that, if it is to be on a mateship basis&mdash;and I will come to that in a moment, from another publication&mdash;who then accepts responsibility?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have here the most critical area of public safety. We want people, as I said, who are dispassionate and skilled. Bill Fisher has to make judgments on all industrial relations matters in the state of New South Wales. He is not a plumber; he is not an electrician; he is not a clerk. He is a man skilled in his professional field. He chairs the Industrial Relations Commission in New South Wales. Yet it is said that he is unfit for this task and that he ought to go. By what principle? By what standard? By what qualification?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you follow through on the idea that you only have those people making decisions about aviation who can fly aeroplanes, we should not have a Prime Minister, the government should not make any decisions, and no&hyphen;one in the cabinet should be dealing with aviation matters, because they are not pilots. The ludicrousness of that kind of argument! I want to see on the board decent, honest people who have good commonsense and are skilled in making decisions and are accountable: not mates. Can we be confident of cronies?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is fortunate that Mr Boyd Munro is here. I am going to turn to his editorial in the AOPA magazine of April 1996. On page 3 it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I especially thank our `Fax Brigade', the front&hyphen;line troops who have made our views known by fax, `phone and letter. I thank those members who have trudged the halls of Parliament House; the members who have attended all those parliamentary hearings; the people who donated money and time to the coalition's election campaign; those who attended all the political events, quietly saying, `we are AOPA.' <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3118"> I salute our President, Dick Smith, whose personal part in the election campaign was enormous. A wonderful team effort has produced a superlative result, and now it is up to all of us to make the most of it.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on later to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">CASA is well&hyphen;known for retribution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That's one of the things that has to be changed. We will never have a better opportunity to do it than now.</PARA>
<PARA>That sentence is in bold type.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Look at the political situation. A new Minister has just taken over. If he finds things are wrong now, he can correct them and it's a positive event because they are clearly the responsibility of the former Minister, Laurie Brereton. Six months from now&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and six months have not elapsed yet&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that won't be true. A year from now any problem in CASA will be the Minister's responsibility and his alone.</PARA>
<PARA>On page 18, in another article, which is like an editorial but is not by&hyphen;lined, he refers to the minister and says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">His Government have also said they will appoint members to the boards of both CASA and Airservices Australia who have real aviation experience.</PARA>
<PARA>I refer you back to his words `never have a better opportunity than to do it now'. But let me go on. At page 24 of this organisation's policy&mdash;which they are entitled to have, and it is good to see they have put their minds to it&mdash;they refer to industry partnership between the bureaucracy as one of their objectives. They say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Industry Partnership between the bureaucracy and operators rather than mistrust and mis&hyphen;communication.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>In a matter like this, it is not a question of partnership. A safety regulator is there to protect the travelling public, not to be in partnership with those who are to be checked or those who are to be regulated. That is not their role, but that is the policy of this organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What worries me even more is the tone of this. We come to page 88. The article is headed `From the desk of the CEO Bart Beech', and I am just plucking out one small bit of it in the time that is available. `Today's aviation environment' is one of the subheadings. It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It won't happen overnight, but it will happen! Relations with CASA are at a low ebb, with Leroy Keith threatening Boyd Munro with action under the Crimes Act.</PARA>
<PARA>Those comments are very serious comments. I have made them in this place, they are in a public document, but from this moment on the minister is at risk. This organisation has compromised him. He, by his own comments on other occasions, has linked up with that, and I fear for the future of aviation safety in this country. You cannot conduct that responsibility with those kinds of relationships. All of those parties who are involved are accountable to this parliament and to the Australian public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We go on then to Mr Smith. Firstly, you have to know where Mr Smith comes from. This is the Civil Aviation Authority annual report of 1990&hyphen;91 and the chairman's comment. In this chairman's comment he refers to restructuring. He says that it will be completed in 1991&hyphen;92 with progressively improved services and cost savings. In that document is a table for the reduction of staff from 727 in January 1991 down to 434 in January 1992, which is a month prior to the departure of chairman Dick Smith. But, if you look at the composition of the board <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3119"> of which Mr Smith was the chairman and you read their background, it makes a farce of the comments of the minister and of Mr Smith and of everybody else who peddled this line about, `Put me on the board. Let me run the show because I fly an aeroplane or I used to fly an aeroplane. I know all.' I do not have time to pull that together; I will do it at a later stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The great mass of the people who use aeroplanes in this country are the people who use the major airlines, the regional airlines and the charter airlines, not the recreation fliers or the hobby fliers. We do not want the tail wagging the dog or the tip of the tail wagging the dog. The responsibility is to the people of this country, the major users of aviation services. If you go through and read who the members of that board were at that time when Mr Smith was chairman, as I said, it makes a farce of the comments that the minister is now making and that have been made by Mr Smith and other people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But let me turn now to the coroner's report about Mr Smith. This is the coroner's report on the air crash of the Monarch Airlines aircraft at Young on 11 June 1993. It says on page 8:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A former Chairman of the CAA had advocated a policy of `affordable safety' which favoured a very lenient approach to policing the regulations. `Affordable safety' does not necessarily equate to `necessary safety'; in effect, it was up to each airline to decide if it was affordable to fly safely. If a plane crashes the airline is up for the cost of the plane; if the passengers and pilots are killed or injured and the airline has no assets or insurance to cover that contingency then the risk is `affordable' to the airline.</PARA>
<PARA>This is not a Morris document; this is the coroner's report and I have quoted faithfully from it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Smith responded to that on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> on Monday, 10 June when asked a question about whether the skies over Australia were safer before or since his time as chairman. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, the first full year I was there, there was only one commercial passenger fatality. The year that I left there was zero, and that was because of hard work. We grounded aeroplanes. I read that coroner's report and it gets me mad because it's full of lies.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>Again, it is not a politician's statement; it is the coroner's report into a grave tragedy. The responses of the former chairman, and he who would be chairman, and of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, and any other organisation under the purview of this government, have been, `That report is full of lies.' The lawyers will sort that out. If the report is full of lies, that will be disclosed by the lawyers in the litigation that obviously will flow from it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I keep coming back to the point that I am greatly worried by what I see and what I hear. There are influences at work&mdash;some are seen and some are unseen&mdash;and there are obviously nods and winks involved in all of this. Then I turn to our report and Mr Smith's claim that safety was best in his year of office. That is a nonsense. We dealt with this in the report. The current minister was a party to this unanimous report and the working committee that prepared the report. He knows, as I know, what Mr Smith did, and the words that we wrote about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Smith removed crew members who died in the crash and the reason given for this fatal accident was crew foolishness. A government decision was that regulations should protect third party and property, not people. In other words, if a crew member died, he did not count that because a crew member should not have conducted himself or herself in a way that led to his or her death.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then he wanted to include balloon passengers. I do not know of any regular public transport service that transports people by balloon. You can have joy rides in them. But he included <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3120"> balloons in one year and excluded crew deaths in another year. The committee's words which start in paragraph 3.30 were:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is an arbitrary and absurd way of compiling and interpreting statistics. Similarly, it is very doubtful whether ballooning accidents qualify for inclusion in official statistics because ballooning is not a recognised mode of transport . . . There are very broad and general reasons for causal connections. If Smith had been able to show, for example, that outputs had increased (eg increased number of ramp checks)&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, that more work had been done</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this may have given some credibility to his claims.</PARA>
<PARA>It is a nonsense that is made by this man who would be chairman of any other organisation within the reach of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then I go on further to the matter, Mr Deputy Speaker, that I mentioned to you the other day in your capacity as chairman of the communications, transport and micro&hyphen;economic reform committee, and that is the advice to you by the minister in his letter of 20 June. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you are aware, I recently publicly foreshadowed a review of Australia's aviation safety regulations&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and so on. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I envisage that the issues identified in the Plane Safe Report of December 1995 . . . will be among the matters considered as part of this review. Accordingly, I consider that any further consideration of such aviation safety matters by the Committee should await completion of the foreshadowed regulatory review. I will ensure that the Committee is kept fully briefed on the work of the review.</PARA>
<PARA>That adds to my worry. In this letter the minister said: `Aviation safety inquiry examination is out of bounds for this committee. The unanimous report to the parliament adopted in full by the previous minister and in process of being implemented, we are looking at again. There are several revisions yet to come, but that committee is out of bounds for them.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know whether the minister, with the best will in the world, is fully aware of the implications of this, and I am putting my comments to him in this way: I do not know whether he really realises what he has created and the situation in which he has been placed. I suspect in a way that he is being manipulated. It is a bit like the artificially inseminated cow: she knows that something is happening, but she is not quite sure how it is happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If it were something of a trivial nature, I would not be so concerned; we could laugh about it. But, in this case, this is the most important safety matter in this nation, next to some medical matter or a plague, or something of that nature. The millions of Australians that travel by air are entitled to expect that aviation safety regulation matters will be administered properly. When they are on a plane up there, those safety regulations should be inviolate. They should not be influenced by personal grudges, financial interests, briefs, or anything else. What worries me greatly is that comment in AOPA's magazine about Leroy Keith.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I read through the minister's statement a few days ago on the review of regulations that is going to be announced tomorrow. Again, he has put himself in the position where, on the one hand, he is attacking staff members of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. I do not know who is writing this stuff for him. I do not know who is providing this advice. But whoever it is obviously does not understand the ramifications of what they have done to their minister. They have sat him up there nicely; he is sitting on the point of the spear. He is not going to be able to move one millimetre&mdash;forwards, backwards or sideways&mdash;because you cannot, as a minister, be accountable to the parliament, be responsible for aviation safety in this country and, at the same time, be hammering the people that are responsible for carrying out that policy.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3121">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased that the minister has come into the committee room, because I want him to hear what I have to say. I hope he will look at <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> and read what I have already said. I fear for you, Minister. I fear for the position in which you have been placed. But you cannot, as a minister, on the one hand, be hammering people in the organisation, unnamed, and, at the same time, be expressing confidence in that organisation's ability to carry out its task.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So in this legislation, simple as it is, the board membership does not matter. It does not matter whether it is three, whether it is nine, or whether it is 10. It is what is behind it, Minister. It is what advice you are being given, and I do not think you are being given the benefit of the best advice that is available or impartial advice. But the position has now changed. As Boyd Munro says, in six months&mdash;come 2 September&mdash;you will be responsible for everything. Today is 27 June. There is not long to go. That is why I would have been much happier if I had seen in what you were doing, what you were saying in respect of our report and what you were saying in respect of this matter, something that much more closely adhered to the views you had and the utterances you made as a member of the committee, in the valuable work that you carried out in the preparation of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Plane safe </EMPHASIS>report. All of that unfinished business has gone on hold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I put those views. I am deeply concerned about them. I hope that the minister will listen. As I have said, if I can help him in any way in respect of those matters, I am only too happy to do that.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(10.53 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, the purpose of the amendments that I have circulated is to give the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) the power to dismiss the board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and to appoint a new board made up of members with aviation experience. As a member for an area with strong commercial and private aviation activity, I am most concerned for the safety of regional aviation in particular. When he was in opposition, the minister was recognised around Australia as one of CASA's outspoken critics. He has been an outspoken and authoritative spokesman for air safety and has done much to elevate this issue to national debate, particularly after the Seaview and Monarch crashes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, I believe the minister has a mandate to honour his pre&hyphen;election commitment to appoint to the board people with appropriate aviation experience, not simply to dilute a board appointed by a former minister by adding two new members. It is completely at odds with the coalition's pre&hyphen;election promise to reduce the size of government. Only one member of the existing board has any previous aviation experience. Appointing two new members with experience will not ensure that the board that oversees aviation safety in this country will still have a majority of members with aviation experience. I accept that the government may be forced to pay out fees for those directors it would remove, but I believe that would be a small price to pay to reassure public confidence in our aviation industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, Australians once took pride in having the world's safest aviation industry. The Seaview and Monarch crashes have critically undermined that confidence. We are talking about a board specifically charged with aviation safety&mdash;not the ABC or a public service board&mdash;and that places special onus on the government and the minister. The recent findings of the Monarch inquest display the serious shortcomings in overseeing the safety standards in our industry. While the current board certainly cannot be blamed for the Monarch disaster, the fact remains that the people who let those operators continue to fly are still doing <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3122"> the same job for CASA as they did for the Civil Aviation Authority&mdash;a slur over those with impeccable records.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, these people, who are now giving advice to the new board, were in place when a plane carrying two young men crashed in the Blue Mountains en route to Forbes on 3 October 1993. But for a mobile ELT&mdash;emergency locator transmitter&mdash;Scott Grezl and Hamish Wallace could well be alive today. They died slow and lingering deaths, over many hours in one case, and perhaps 15 days in another; their plane, and its fixed ELT, burnt beyond any use. The ELT was in fact inoperative, out of sight, out of mind and not hand&hyphen;held. As a news editor covering this protracted case, I spoke with relatives and investigators and was horrified at the waste of these lives and in fact the entire search process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current board of CASA still refuses, as I understand it, to approve portable ELTs, although they are in use in jumbos. I do not believe the current board has the expertise to make a sound judgment on this or on any other air safety issue nor will it have majority expertise under the government's proposals. It is essential that public confidence in our aviation industry is restored. It is essential that the federal parliament shows leadership on this issue and does not just take the easy way out. The Civil Aviation Amendment Bill, as it stands, is a Clayton's bill: the one you have when you don't have a bill. My amendments give this bill the clout it needs, and it effectively precludes any spill over of the legislation into other areas so it will not impact on other statutory bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have reason to believe many aircraft operators, including major operators, are strongly opposed to what they see as a weak response by the minister to a serious problem. Max Hazelton, the founder of Hazelton Airlines, a regional operator in my electorate with an enviable safety record, also sees an urgent need for real change and that can only come from an experienced board. These amendments are designed to allow the minister to address what the industry and the flying public require&mdash;that is, the need for the government to control the efficiency and, most importantly, the safety of the airline industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his own words to parliament this week, the transport minister expressed concern that the old CAA culture still existed despite a change of name. He also said that he is not satisfied that CASA has responded fully to a report into the DC3 crash into Botany Bay in 1994. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will be a major tragedy if the only thing that has happened is that the shingle on the front door is changed.</PARA>
<PARA>That `major tragedy' metaphor may come back to haunt the minister, and us all, if decisive action is not taken now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have no problems with the board. I do not know the members of the board. Gabi Hollows is a wonderful person. Justice Fisher an honourable man with a proud record, but not in this critical area. Those comments from the minister this week constitute a vote of no confidence, an argument for a new board with the confidence of the government, the minister and therefore the public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Press reports today talk of a showdown looming between the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and the minister. CASA's chairman has described the minister's comments as defamatory, saying that the current board was set up with the capacity to resist pressure groups, including those supported by the minister. The member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) speaks of nods and winks. I have seen enough of that in politics over the years from the outside and I guess, in many ways, that is why I am here. Nodding and winking is a past habit of governments <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3123"> of all persuasions but I do not believe this is about nodding and winking at all. It is about that essential safety in an essential industry. The constitution of that board must reign far and above any other board and the statutory constitutions of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have heard the name Dick Smith mentioned in this debate. I do not know who the minister might want on his board. I certainly do not have any suggestions. I leave that to people with more expertise. But I do know the gulf between the current board and its minister is now so wide that the public should be appalled at the prospect of a continuing relationship between this board, this minister and air safety.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) spoke of the fact that we may never get another airport in Sydney. That, I believe, could be a factor in the next ten years at least, and it will only exacerbate the safety concerns that we have in the airline industry. I also noticed that the minister has referred to the transport and infrastructure committee, I think it is, a reference on air freight. I suggest that that committee look seriously, and I mean seriously, at the Parkes airport proposal as not only a freight option but perhaps a hub and spoke passenger option as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had indications that the government will not support my amendments even though it favours them. It has been suggested to me that my delaying the bill's passage is cementing in place the board that does not have the minister's additions to it. The minister's amendment on the structure of the board is a Clayton's amendment. Any delay is not my problem. My problem is the safety of the air travelling public and the need for a minister to have full confidence in the board, and through them, the organisation charged with air safety. The minister's problem can be easily solved. Support my amendments. I will be seeking a detailed discussion and that this bill go back to the House with an unresolved question.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Keeping an eye on what has been said earlier today, I would like to pass a few comments in relation to previous speakers. Firstly, I refer to some comments made by the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) and thank him for his contribution. I note his comments in regard to the EIS guidelines. They are the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill), who will be drawing those up. It is my hope that that will be done as quickly as possible because this process needs to be set in place as quickly as we can to alleviate concerns in Sydney about the site for a second airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) was up to his usual game of politics, as ever, and made a number of comments, one of which related to the campaign of the honourable member for Lowe (Mr Zammit) in the recent election. The honourable member for Watson somewhat changed some of the promises made by the now member for Lowe by claiming that Mr Zammit had promised there would be no aeroplanes over the seat of Lowe if you voted for him but that there would be aeroplanes over the seat of Lowe if you voted for Mary Easson, the then sitting member for the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not a true and accurate account of the promises made by the now member for Lowe in his election campaign. The commitments at that time were that there would be no new flight <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3124"> paths. The reference there to `new' was in relation to flight paths that existed prior to November 1994. Prior to the opening of the third runway there were a number of well-established flight paths that existed in the electorate of Lowe and the commitment was that there would be no new flight paths. Certainly, to our knowledge to date, that commitment has not been broken. So it is inaccurate and unfair of the member for Watson to try to interpret the words of the member for Lowe during the election campaign and try, therefore, to paint him as not having lived up to the promises he made in that campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He also said that our decision to introduce slots for Sydney airport was a ruse to raise revenue, as I think he put it, and that we would sell these slots off to the highest bidder. That is not our intention. We are negotiating with industry at the present time as to the best mechanism we can use. We are setting up two committees in industry to assist us in coming to a proper and fair mechanism for the allocation of slots.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things I want to assure the House about, and this would be of particular interest to the member for Calare (Mr Andren), being a representative of a regional area, particularly one that is so noted for its aviation services, is that there will be dedicated slots for Sydney airport for regional airline operations. We can guarantee through this process that regional airline operations will still have access to Mascot airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is something that I know regional representatives from the New South Wales area would be particularly interested in. And I, of course, representing a regional part of New South Wales with a number of aviation services currently flying into Mascot Airport, would also view it as important that, in establishing a slot process for Sydney's airport operations, regional airlines are given their fair share of those slots. That is part of the process. We are going to guarantee that. Indeed, if we did not do it this way, the possibilities of regional airline operations being squeezed out of Mascot would be much greater if we did not have a proper slot management process. That is what the slot allocation process is all about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will also talk about the comments made by the honourable member for Watson in regard to affordable safety. He belittled the terminology and the philosophy behind it. Whilst affordable safety is not a term I would necessarily use myself, I think you cannot argue the logic of affordable safety. Everything that we do in life in relation to safety is measured by our ability to afford it. We only have limited resources to allocate to safety and we have to allocate them to the best of our ability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we did not do that, everybody would own a Mercedes motorcar, because we know Mercedes motorcars are safer in car crashes than driving around in a Volkswagen. Yet Mercedes motorcars are more expensive than Volkswagens, therefore people in their normal daily lives have to make a judgment about safety based upon their ability to afford it. So the logic of affordable safety is just a fact of life; it is something we cannot deny. I do not know whether I would have necessarily used the terminology. At any rate, it has been used. But the honourable member for Watson should not be mischievous in trying to denigrate the philosophy behind that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I now go to the comments by the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris). As always in these debates he is a contributor, and a well&hyphen;considered contributor, being someone with considerable knowledge and interest in this area over a lengthy period of time, and also as a pilot who learnt many years ago and as an active person in the aviation community. Can I say to the honourable member, because he would be very interested in and committed to the recommendations of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Plane safe</EMPHASIS> report, which is the result of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3125"> committee he chaired, that we are undertaking work now to ensure that we can pick up those recommendations. It would be my view, having been a member of that committee, that there is a great deal of sense, logic and gain to be had by implementing recommendations in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Plane safe</EMPHASIS> report.</PARA>

Indeed, it frustrates me at times that we are not doing it faster, but we will do it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also thank the honourable member for Calare for his contribution. I appreciate the sentiment of his amendments and I appreciate the words that he has expressed here today. I particularly take note of his comments in regard to ELTs and the example he used of those two young gentlemen who were killed as a consequence of their aeroplane crashing in the Blue Mountains. They survived the crash&mdash;indeed, were not all that injured in the crash&mdash;but their ELT, which was fixed to the aircraft, did not go off and they perished several days later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a very good example as to why we need to look more carefully at the ELT issue. We have done that and we have made a judgment, with the support of the board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, which we believe is a sensible one. That is now to be implemented very shortly. I thank the honourable member for Calare for making those comments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I just remind members of the House that the purpose behind this bill is to ensure that we can deliver on our election commitments. I see the honourable member for Shortland questioning whether we have the support of the board in regard to ELTs. I am pretty sure I can even provide you with the correspondence, and I shall shortly.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. We will not have a discussion across the table, otherwise we will run out of time and the Deputy Speaker will pull me up. Can I just say that the purpose of expanding the size of the board was to deliver on our commitment made during the election campaign, which was to ensure that we had people on the board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority who had aviation expertise. That was a genuine commitment we made. When we came into government we endeavoured to see that fulfilled. Of course, under the legislation, we were unable to dismiss the board and to appoint new people. The honourable member for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3126"> Calare made that point in his speech. We take the view that it is important that the board members have a relationship with the industry that is cohesive and cooperative.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is a terribly important issue that we do have people running our safety regulator who have appropriate qualifications and experience in aviation. For those of you who disagree with that, my reference to you would be the Monarch coroner's report that was released only a couple of weeks ago, in which he outlined some of the very serious deficiencies in the old CAA that existed at the time of the Monarch crash. It is a damning indictment of the old CAA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst the structure of the old CAA has changed and we now have two organisations, the simple fact of the matter is that those organisations are still staffed nearly completely by the same people who were there before. There have been structural changes, but they have not necessarily led to a cultural change. In order to ensure that the culture of the CASA, the regulator, and the performance of that body are at their maximum and delivering the best safety system for Australian air travellers, we must have people who know what they are talking about&mdash;people who do have appropriate experience and qualifications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note&mdash;the honourable member for Calare referred to it in his address today&mdash;the comments of the Chairman of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, criticising me for attacking the Civil Aviation Safety Authority in my speech in the House on Tuesday of this week. I make the point that&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="TANNER" NAMEID="YU5">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YU5">Mr Tanner</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And attacking the board.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AJ4">Mr SHARP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I make the point, though, that, as the person ultimately responsible to the parliament and to the people of Australia for aviation safety in this country, I take it as an important right of mine to make criticism where it is appropriate and to give praise where it is due. If I am not allowed to make those sorts of criticisms or give that sort of praise, then I find that extraordinary. Justice Fisher's criticisms of me were partly based on the fact that I dared to criticise the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, its staff and its board members. That is, indeed, my duty, as I understand it, and I will not shirk that responsibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I also make the point that Justice Fisher's criticisms of me in his press release of yesterday run completely contrary to the letter that he sent me in April of this year. He says in his letter why he believes he should continue to stay on and how he can justify his decision to stay on as the chairman of the board. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You may rely on my own and the Board's loyal support for your administration as Minister limited only by our statutory duty to determine matters independently.</PARA>
<PARA>Justice Fisher in his comments yesterday, and in comments that he has made in press releases since he wrote that letter, contradicts himself and draws into question whether the intent of his statement in the letter I have just quoted from is actually being delivered upon. I know some people say&mdash;indeed, Justice Fisher would say&mdash;that he is appropriately qualified for the task. Justice Fisher is a lawyer. He is a judge. He is somebody who has some occupational safety expertise. But, again, none of that expertise that he has&mdash;no matter how well qualified he may be in those areas&mdash;is relevant to aviation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Looking at other members of the board, there are only four members, only one of whom has aviation experience: Geoff Molloy. Of the other two members, Dr Claire Pollock is a systems analyst from Western Australia and is no doubt highly qualified in her area and a very responsible person, but I make the point in this speech that she has no experience relevant to aviation. It is the same with Gabi Hollows, who is&mdash;as members have pointed out&mdash;a wonderful person, a person whom Australians can look up to. Again, her qualifications, as <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3127"> described by Justice Fisher, are as a consumer advocate. She is not a member of any consumer organisations that I am aware of. She, like many hundreds of thousands of Australians who use commercial aviation, could be judged as a consumer advocate. Therefore, again, she has no experience relevant to aviation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why this legislation is before the House today. It is important for us to have people who have relevant expertise and experience in aviation administering aviation safety regulation on a day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day basis for us. Unfortunately, of the four non&hyphen;executive directors of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority board, only one has any relevant experience; the others do not&mdash;hence the principle behind the Civil Aviation Safety Act amendment that we have put before the parliament at this time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I go to the particular amendments to the bill. I thank the member for Calare for his proposed amendments and for the sentiments behind them. However, the intent of the amendments go well beyond what the government would propose, which is simply to ensure that the board has members with appropriate aviation experience. They touch on broader policy issues which relate to statutory authorities generally, and the coalition government will address those issues separately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), for his amendment to the motion for the second reading. I consider his first point inappropriate, as the bill before the House does not preclude appointment of people with the types of experience suggested. On his second point, I would have to question the intent of the provision, and I do not consider that the House can provide such a broad test to this, or any other, board. It seems, therefore, that the opposition may have a vendetta against an individual or individuals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is extraordinarily hypocritical on the part of the opposition that, when in government, it made appointments such as that of Bill Kelty to the Board of the Reserve Bank, yet would now require the House to limit this government with regard to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. The government does not therefore support the amendment to the motion for the second reading.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by saying that this is a very important issue. I know everybody has their personal views about particular people and particular processes, and that they have some loyalties to those people and processes. But I say to the House that this is a very important issue. I know the people who have spoken on this bill treat it as such. We have seen a number of accidents in recent years which can be attributed in part to the failure of the Civil Aviation Authority of old. Indeed, it could well be that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority at this time is still not sufficiently reformed to ensure that we have an authority that is going to deliver the safest aviation regime for Australia. It is a very serious matter. We should not treat it lightly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank members who have contributed to this debate. The thing that we take as an overriding principle in all of this is that, in an area that is so important to the safety of millions of Australians every year, we have people on the board governing the safety regulator who have appropriate experience and qualifications and understand the technical aspects of aviation and its language, history and culture, and who therefore are in a position to make sensible, proper and appropriate judgments without delay, thus ensuring that people who use our air services around Australia have an organisation regulating aviation safety that is driven by the best possible available expertise.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In my haste to get up here, I actually left some notes of mine behind. But I have had time to carefully go through the government response, and I would like to say a few things, including some that I said when the report was tabled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was a bipartisan committee. The report reflected the good work of all committee members. I am a little disappointed that some of those members, for one reason or another, were not returned to the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I guess that when you table reports you do not expect that all of the recommendations will be embraced. I think that is true of this report. As I said when I tabled this report, I felt that it was not so much that the recommendations would be tested as that, rather, the government's response would be tested against how many of the recommendations were adopted. Whilst I understood that some might provide difficulty, I was really surprised at how many were rejected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps the most controversial proposal was the abolition of the undergraduate program at ADFA, and its replacement with a scholarship scheme. I think it is fair to say that committee opinion varied; there were a range of views, from strongly endorsing it to thinking it should at least be considered. Therefore, I find the minister's response&mdash;and the government's response&mdash;to the recommendation particularly poor. I think it is a little mendacious and somewhat cavalier, if not irresponsible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will just go through the arguments again, because I have been attacked in the paper over this. We spend $200 million on the professional development of some 11,000 officers. There are about 1,000 officer cadets at ADFA. They consume $100 million. The scholarship scheme would save $60 million. If you paid for the 1,000 university places from the defence budget and put in additional places in the 37 other universities, the saving would be $50 million. That is not an inconsiderable saving. Defence applies a number of methodologies to its approach to all aspects of its work. One is `value for money'&mdash;those are not my words. ADFA does not, I believe, survive that first and most basic test: providing value for money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the previous government introduced a commercial support program which really suggested that defence needed to stick to its defence kitty for core activities, and that individuals or private enterprises could provide services: that there ought to be a competitive <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3129"> regime, and the most successful tenderer should win. They have been doing this for some years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is it argued that the training of undergraduates is a core activity of the Defence Department? I do not believe it. Indeed, there are 37 other universities who graduate 132,000 students. ADFA graduates 300 a year. I think it is absolutely preposterous to suggest that developing undergraduates is a core activity of the Defence Department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been some light&hyphen;hearted reference, if you like, to this idea that there is value in the future officer corps of Australia understanding their cohorts' values and beliefs, as they would if they were going to other universities. That is, given that the ADF seeks to serve the community, the community is important to the ADF and you cannot start this too early. I passionately believe that. But it is suggested that, if some of the female cadets play netball and the men put their bums in a scrum, somehow they have these wonderful discussions about belief systems, values and attitudes where this is all picked up on their sporting activities. This is just absolute nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, most importantly of all the arguments, the particular one I wish to advance has received too little attention. That is that when young people have determined upon a career, have narrowed it down and have signed up for that career, they want to get into the action as quickly as possible. What ADFA does is incarcerate them straight out of high school, and it can be up to six years after signing on to be an infantryman, or to drive a ship or to pilot a plane, before they actually do it. I suspect this large gap has an impact on separation rates and I challenge the minister, in his cavalier rejection of the recommendation, to look at the separation rates. Just start watching those separation rates, because I suspect there is every chance that ADFA graduates may have higher separation rates than the rest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some other arguments I want to advance as well. It is said that this provides a unique environment to inculcate the military ethos and the profession of arms. If it is so unique, if it is so beneficial, why don't all officers go through it? Why don't we scrap direct entry and why don't we put all other rank officer candidates through ADFA? Of course, there is a simple reason: we cannot afford it. That is the first thing. Let me propose something you may find faintly ridiculous. If this is so important, if this is so essential and everything that follows after ADFA has so little impact on military ethos and the profession of arms, why don't we start incarceration at age 13? Why don't we have a sister high school, or several high schools, located in and around ADFA and we will start this incarceration process at that age? It is a ridiculous argument. But then I think the opposition has been ridiculous as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to completely reject the argument that it is too early to judge. I do not care what the institution is that we establish, it is always appropriate that there be reviews and finetuning and that people have an opportunity to revisit the issue. There is the suggestion that it is only when we get a CDF who has graduated from ADFA that we will know for certain whether the institution has served us well or not served us well. Certainly, in relation to ADFA, within the committee the range of opinions was from `strongly for' to `at least ought to be considered'. I am the first one to acknowledge it. But I must say I am particularly disappointed in the response.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to cover a few other issues and one of them is jointery. I believe jointery was pioneered in a very good way at ADFA. But I do not believe that the ADF can continue with the farce of saying that one of the best features of ADFA is jointery&mdash;and I accept that&mdash;but we are going to preclude people from jointery until they get up to the Command and Staff <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3130"> College. You cannot be half in and half out. If jointery is worthwhile, we need to maintain it. That is why I still stand by the committee's recommendation about looking at the feasibility of a tri&hyphen;service pre&hyphen;commissioning college.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's rejection of co&hyphen;locating the separate colleges&mdash;that is, the WRAN Staff College, the Army Command and Staff College and the RAAF Command and Staff College, all integrated into a tri&hyphen;service ADF Command and Staff College located in Canberra, with the common military curriculum and tri&hyphen;service elements in it&mdash;I find appalling. It was one of the things that really surprised me. I note in the government response that they are going to do a further review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They propose, at best, the co&hyphen;locating of the three colleges; all in one location but with no common military core training and no integration of the colleges. We will have three colleges smack&hyphen;bang in the one location. What an absolute farce. There may be some savings in that, but they would be minuscule. It will not be jointery. It goes completely against the thrust of that. I would be surprised if this approach attracted the support of the Public Works Committee, whom they will inevitably have to consult. I am absolutely convinced that one day we will see tri&hyphen;service pre&hyphen;commissioning and we will see a single command and staff college with common subjects and single&hyphen;service elements in it as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One issue in the committee's report which I had thought was understood&mdash;in fact, I thought it was quite reasonable&mdash;was, again, rejected. It was that there are two elements to officer training. The first is the officers' professional development and education, which we were privileged to review and which the nine separate colleges all administer, at a cost of $200 million. The second element is the war fighting skills that are inevitably associated with the profession of arms. This was outside the terms of reference of the committee&mdash;and, in fact, having reviewed it, I do not know that any committee of the parliament would feel too comfortable about it&mdash;but, having made what I think were fairly fundamental and significant recommendations for change on the one side, if you were going to change any of that, you really needed to have looked at the other side and made sure that it all fitted into a continuum. That particular recommendation has been really misunderstood, as far as I can tell, in the government's response.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to return to a couple of things about the scholarship scheme. What incredibly bad timing it was to table this report on the day of national protest, when every university campus was up in arms about possible loss of staff, loss of funding or increases in HECS! The most pampered, gold plated institution in Australia will not lose one staff member, and we will not be saving one dollar of expenditure. Under the scholarship proposal recommended in the committee's report, it is nonsense to say that the ADF cannot be guaranteed a supply of university graduates. This is the only way, as the government's response tries to argue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me refer to the number of students previously. In 1993, in science, engineering, humanities and arts, which are the faculties that ADFA draws from, a total of 132,860 students graduated. To say that offering a scholarship for these people would not guarantee a supply is rubbish. The ready reserve scheme puts people with a university degree into the officer corp, it puts people into the reserve and also into the other ranks. I happen to think that is a good thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I think there are a couple of things that will be of absolute and fundamental significance to Defence. The first is the Glenn review, which has been published, and the second is Army 21. I also want to acknowledge, as I did previously, the contributions of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3131"> right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) to the committee's report. The work of this committee is not inconsistent with the direction of those other two works and I think as time goes by we will see them implemented. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to speak on this. In saying that to you, I also extend to the government the fact that I think it is important, when there is a response from the government on a committee's recommendations, that there is an opportunity to debate them either here or, preferably, in the other place. By `the other place', I mean the main chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am always conscious that time is of the essence but I guess I am one of the few people around this place who thinks we are mad having two weeks on and two weeks off. I am one of those who thinks we were far better when we sat for three weeks and had one week off. It gave continuity to debate, allowed for reasonable consideration of issues and we got far more out of parliament. I know this Main Committee is an adjunct, and that we are all given a chance to say our tuppence worth, but I still feel that it does not equate with the capacity to debate issues in parliament. I see it as an excuse rather than anything else. I think it is very important that we do not just set aside forever the nature and character of discussions regarding the function of this Main Committee and the House. I hope that, at some stage, we can revert back to having more debate within the parliament itself, particularly on issues such as this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am delighted to see that some cadets have come in to listen to us. I welcome them to this place because they have come at a time when we are debating an issue that relates, in one sense, to their futures. The former chair of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and, prior to that, the chair of the subcommittee on Defence, the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) is also here, as is the former secretary, Ms Gillian Gould. I am delighted to see Gillian here. Gillian put a lot of effort into her Defence commitment and indeed is one of the few who went to the Joint Services Staff College. For those of you who are cadets, it is down near the sewerage farm, down that end of town! I can assure you that those who come out of the college are far different from that that goes into the adjacent works. It is a very worthwhile facility and one which is part of the area that we examine in this report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now turn to a few issues in the report itself. If governments are going to respond to a committee's report, I do not think that they should present a response which is as inadequate as this. There is nothing more profound than trying to determine the direction and role of those of you who are trying to make a career in the forces. Because we have cadets here, let me say to them that they have all sorts of alternatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all hope and pray that peace is maintained. And, as parliamentarians, we will do our utmost, in our respective ways, in whatever the party, to achieve and maintain peace. But we do not look at the future by saying that what we have will always be. There is nothing more fundamental than this particular issue which we are talking about in this chamber. We are talking here about the government's response to the report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had forgotten we had the bosses behind us; I should have stood and saluted them. I did not know we had all the high brass. Perhaps they would like to take part, as part of the officer education team.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are talking about a report that was prepared by a committee of the parliament, called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Officer education: the military after next</EMPHASIS>. At the moment, we are dealing with the government's response. It is a very thin document. The report is quite a worthwhile tome, and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3132"> those of you interested in joining the services might find it worthwhile to read it. It has about 250 pages, and covers a large range of subjects pertaining to officer education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because I have only a few minutes, I want to talk about some of the detail. There are three areas, in particular, which I want to address. The first is staff colleges. The response by the government on staff colleges was, to say the least, totally inadequate. We all recognise that it is very hard for members of parliament to actually produce a report with sufficient analysis, detail and background for all of its recommendations to be implemented. But one area of officer education which stands out as needing reform is that of staff colleges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the audience, I will say that there are different levels of officer education, and staff colleges are the colleges to which officers go when they are at the captain or major level. They have been platoon commanders; in other words, they have had junior responsibilities and have looked after platoons. At the stage at which they move to becoming more administrative and embracing wider responsibilities, they go to staff colleges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Demonstrably, the navy, the army and the air force each have different requirements. We may not have adequately addressed those in the report, but we certainly attempted to ensure that we looked at the requirements for each service and then looked at the combined requirements for tri&hyphen;service education. We felt that it was obvious that there needed to be some rebuilding of the facilities. The government has acknowledged that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has also said it might look at collocating staff college facilities. But we went beyond that; we said that it would be a very good idea if the three staff colleges were collocated in Canberra and, within that combined staff college, you provided a combination that provided, in some part, for common education across the three services. Although you may be wearing an army uniform, there will quite often be a requirement for you to work with members of the other two armed forces. I think it is particularly important that that tri&hyphen;service education at the staff colleges be promoted. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Frankly, I do not accept the government's response to this. I feel that the integration of the three staff colleges is not only desirable but essential. I believe that, in addition to tri&hyphen;service training, you can provide  supplementary individual training to meet the differing requirements of the three services. For example, the naval course is much shorter than the army course, but I do not accept that you cannot overcome that by giving each service whatever that service wants, in its particular form, after meeting what I see as an essential tri&hyphen;service obligation. So I certainly reject that part of this report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next part of the report that concerns me is the half&hyphen;baked response to our suggestion that distance education is a way by which you can supplement military education. One of the real problems is that many senior appointments in the services are made from among people who have had no opportunity to go to staff college. It is true that many of you may well go on to some form of tertiary education. Some of you might go to the services, some of you might go to university and some of you might go to TAFE. It does not matter where you go; in whatever career you follow, you will ultimately come to the position where that career is helped by the education you had before you got there. Where you have not had the opportunity to go to university or to do a particular course at a TAFE college, there are other opportunities, if you are in the civilian stream. Many of them are achieved through distance education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am a great advocate of distance education. While the government said that it supported the idea of distance education in principle, the response seemed to me to be very shallow. I do not accept the point that it makes that, to quote the response:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3133">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . staff college course content is such that distance learning cannot completely replace all the learning outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>It cannot replace all of them, but you can provide some opportunity to have people in a staff college for a relatively short period of time, if you cannot send them there for 12 months. One of my worries with the staff college course is that 12 months is a long period to take out of a middle level officer's life, but there is no reason that you cannot take him in for occasional two&hyphen;week intensive periods and let him do some of the academic work by distance education. I thought that response was inadequate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is necessary that the services have more flexibility in the way in which they provide advanced training for their officers, and distance education is a very good way by which it can be achieved. Indeed, I have been interested to see, as I have moved around service facilities around Australia&mdash;and I commend them for it&mdash;how many senior officers have taken university degrees. A former senior officer is sitting alongside me at the moment: the member for Groom (Mr Taylor), who is a former Commodore in the Royal Australian Navy. He took several university degrees while he was a serving officer in the services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point is that there are ways by which you can combine intensive in&hyphen;service training by going to particular facilities. I see no reason why you cannot go to the tri&hyphen;service staff college, as we envisage, for whatever the period might be. It might be a fortnight or it might be a few weeks; but you could do it in such a way as to supplement that distance learning. I certainly think the services need to pursue that concept further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because the most fundamental of the recommendations related to ADFA, the Australian Defence Force Academy, and it was one of the prime recommendations of the committee&mdash;although not one that was universally endorsed&mdash;I wanted to say a few things before I close on that subject. There are three aspects to officer training that we need to consider. The first is the state of our economy. At the moment, because there is high unemployment, the nature of people entering at different levels of the Defence Force is different from that at a time of full employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, in the recruiting to the ready reserves, the number of young men and women who have joined the ready reserves, not just because they would like the opportunity, the discipline and the training but also because it is a vehicle by which they can get a tertiary education, has been remarkable. My worry about the employment market is that, as we move into full employment&mdash;and they are already having difficulties in recruiting sufficiently in each of the three services at ADFA&mdash;that position could get worse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second aspect, of course, is the security situation. As I began by saying, everyone hopes that peace will continue and, therefore, there is not a suggestion of having to recruit people for some urgent military confrontation. The third aspect is just as important, and that is to try to look at a phrase which I notice several people have criticised because they did not like it and which came from an academic from New Zealand. It has always appealed to me, and it is the term `the military after next'. Sure, it is a jargon phrase. It is like `multiculturalism'&mdash;a word which I do not particularly like but which covers something that we all understand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we talk about `the military after next', we are talking about the officers who are going to command the Australian Defence Force in the 21st century, and we try to look beyond those who are now serving to the character and nature of the force after the present one. We were trying to see whether we could augment present training opportunities. Again, we did not come down with a final, definitive recommendation; we looked at a number of flexible options.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3134">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My worry with the rejection of the committee's report is not that perhaps, after consideration, it may be too early for the change, but that to say that the report lacks substantive and sufficiently detailed reasoning to justify such a proposal&mdash;when the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) is now, properly, looking at university education right across Australia&mdash;seems to me to be saying, `It does not matter what is happening in every other tertiary institution in Australia, we are not going to look at what is happening at ADFA.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That might be going too far but, frankly, there is justifiable reason for us to make sure that taxpayers get value for their dollar and that those who are students get the best possible education, and not just an education for education's sake. Really, education is what you remember when you have forgotten what you have learnt. When you leave school, those things which you remember are going to be the reason that you went to school. The learning that you do in order to pass exams or to become non&hyphen;commissioned or commissioned officers in the cadet corps or wherever is all the product of particular subjects. But education is something that lasts well beyond what you may forget in the day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day rigours of the subjects you take, either in the Defence Force or at school.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as ADFA is concerned, I think it is an excellent training opportunity, but I think it is too restricted. I do not believe that it necessarily provides the only way by which you can train future officers. I grant you that there are other ways of admission. Of all the evidence given to us, what struck me was the advice from the then commander of Duntroon, who told us that, six months after he had had ADFA cadets in Duntroon, he could not tell the difference between ADFA cadets and those who had come in as direct entry. I know that, certainly in the air force, where I have had some experience, often those who are very good officer material are not necessarily good pilots.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, I am concerned at the response on ADFA. I think that it is too narrowly based. I think there is reason in looking at ways by which the initial entry of officer cadets can be modified and changed. I am disappointed that the government perhaps has not given more time and attention to what I see as fundamental in shaping the nature and character of the `military after next'.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In particular, I know that about 70 per cent of the group are prospective entrants into the Australian Defence Force. It was not tailored the way it happened this morning; it just happened that they were coming, and we thought that, rather than do the program that they were going to do, they should come and listen to something which was relevant to the future careers of a lot of them. So, I welcome them here this morning. I hope that what we have to say is of value to them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, I would like to pay tribute to one of their number, who is sitting right behind me over here&mdash;Major Bryce Rogers, who has just retired. Earlier in the week I did acknowledge in writing to Bryce the very substantial contribution that he has made to the cadet movement in southern Queensland, in the Toowoomba area, over many years&mdash;far more than perhaps he wants to remember. Nevertheless, he has made a very large contribution. These students here this morning, members of 13 RCU, are drawn from both public and private <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3135"> schools in the Toowoomba area. I welcome them once again to listen to this debate&mdash;albeit a very abbreviated debate&mdash;on what is a very major subject.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I say first of all, Mr Deputy Speaker, that of course the cadet movement is important to the future of our nation and to the Australian Defence Force. I hope that, in the context of the 20 August budget, we will see some of the rhetoric of the coalition in opposition converted into substance. We did give an undertaking in the policy document, in the lead&hyphen;up to the election, that we would do something substantive in the area of cadets. I hope that that will, in fact, be carried through in the context of that budgetary setting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, with that said, it is a pleasure for me once again to stand in this Main Committee room and to talk briefly about this very important report and, in so doing, to follow two very eminent people&mdash;on the other side, and now in opposition, the former Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price); and, alongside me, a longstanding member, in fact the father of the House, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), who is also, as I have said to the young people who are here today, a former and very eminent Minister for Defence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure that, if they take on board what Mr Sinclair has had to say briefly here today, it will stand them in good stead this afternoon when they go to the Australian Defence Force Academy. I thought it appropriate that they should come in and listen to some comments about a report which is very important to where a lot of them are heading.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just want to mention three recommendations in this report. There are 23 recommendations in the report, and I agree with the right honourable member for New England in his criticism of the brevity of the government's response. I think it is perhaps a little too brief. But I have to say that I agree in general terms with what it has said. It goes back to the substance of what was in this very substantial document. As the right honourable member will recall, I did have some reservations, within the privacy of the joint standing committee. When the report was actually tabled, the wording was used so that people like me could stand up and, while not wanting to oppose what was being recommended, at least indicate that I had some strong reservations about some aspects of what it was recommending.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not to say that, as a former long&hyphen;serving naval officer, I was predisposed to a certain position in relation to the development of the officer corps, but that I thought that what was being proposed, particularly in relation to the Defence Force Academy, was premature, bearing in mind one or two points that I will come to in a moment. What I would like to do briefly is go through three particular recommendations&mdash;bearing in mind that, of the 23 recommendations, 13 have been accepted by the government either in principle or in part, or are under review. So it has been substantially agreed to by the government in a lot of areas. But, as in some of the points made by the right honourable member for New England, some of the areas where the committee recommended a major change have not been followed through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The three areas that I would like to briefly address are, first, pre&hyphen;commissioning colleges; secondly, staff colleges; and, thirdly, the Defence Force Academy. In relation to the pre&hyphen;commissioning colleges, which are in recommendation 11 of the report, I think in hindsight&mdash;although I did make this point in the context of the committee hearings and in the development of the report&mdash;that too much emphasis was put on the need for jointery. For the benefit of 13 RCU, what we mean by that is the degree to which the army, navy and air force are working together in a very disciplined and formalised sense. I felt&mdash;and it has been the feeling of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3136"> government response&mdash;that perhaps it is too early to do that, although I have to say that the response also indicates that it is an open door and they will continue to review that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The existing single service colleges&mdash;whether they be at Point Cook, Duntroon or Jervis Bay&mdash;are making a major contribution in terms of the non&hyphen;degree stream. Perhaps we should not move as quickly as the report was indicating should be done in the very short term. So I tend to agree with the government response on recommendation 11. But, at the same time, I also agree with the right honourable gentleman that the response is somewhat brief&mdash;some would say too brief. But the door is open and it will continue to be reviewed within the Department of Defence and within the three services. That is the first point on recommendation 11 on pre&hyphen;commissioning colleges and the need to perhaps continue with those single service colleges without injecting into the military equation the need for too much jointery too early in the career of officer trainees. That is basically what that report is all about&mdash;bringing into a joint environment the three single service colleges much earlier than is the present situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point I would like to discuss briefly is in relation to staff colleges. As the right honourable gentleman has said&mdash;and I think I agree&mdash;the response from the department, certainly in the response document, was somewhat inadequate. In fact, a lot could be done in terms of the staff colleges. At the moment, the staff colleges&mdash;again for the benefit of 13 RCU&mdash;are: at HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Penguin</EMPHASIS> at Balmoral, Sydney, for the navy; at Queenscliff, Victoria, for the army; and at RAAF Fairbairn, Canberra, for the air force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we all agreed in the committee that there was room to manoeuvre in terms of a core curriculum for those three colleges, to bring them together much more than they are at the moment, and then to have some sort of single&hyphen;service training in conjunction with this core approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That has not been agreed by the government. It is one of the recommendations that did have a lot of validity and could have been done in the short term. I just hope that the two ministers for defence, in conjunction with the defence department bureaucracy, the commander of the defence force and the three chiefs of staff, are going to look more carefully at the situation of the staff colleges. I agree with Mr Sinclair that that particular one is disappointing. A lot could have been done in the short to medium term, albeit that there would have been budgetary implications. Those budgetary implications could have been programmed into what is a very extensive budget indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to talk briefly about the Australian Defence Force Academy. The report says that the present arrangements should be terminated and that we should go back to an undergraduate scheme utilising all the universities around Australia which, of course, was the previous course of action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I disagree with that; it is not a fundamental disagreement, because the government's response also says that it will be kept under review. The reason that I say it is inappropriate at this point in time is that nobody who has graduated from the Defence Force Academy, to my knowledge, has yet achieved the rank of major. It is probably a little too early to do it. So whilst I do not oppose totally what is in the report in terms of a review of it, I do oppose the specifics of recommendation 14 that the Defence Force Academy arrangements should be terminated. I think that that will be reviewed in the coming years. I agree with Mr Sinclair that we should have an open mind about it, and that really is reflected in the government's response.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One specific point in relation to the cadet movement: I think all of us and the Australian nation need to understand the very parlous conditions and the very ad hoc arrangements under <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3137"> which young men and women like this have to operate. It is very difficult for them to get basic uniforms and equipment, and whilst we do not want to get involved here this morning in the mechanics of the present rather vociferous public debate on firearm reform proposals, it is difficult for a lot of groups like 13 RCU to really feel that they are part of something leading up to a meaningful career if they do not have some of the basics. I want to take the opportunity to place on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record something that Bryce Rogers raised with me this morning. It is something that I have had raised with me by another officer commanding the Toowoomba Grammar School cadet unit only in the last 10 days as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final point I want to make in this debate is to read into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record an extract from a letter that I received only in the last few days from one of the nation's most senior retired officers. It relates not specifically to this debate but to the role of defence. I take the opportunity to place this on the record. He said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It does seem to me that current defence thinking needs to be challenged in a number of areas, not least being how long can we really afford to continue with Jindalee&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that happens to be the over&hyphen;the&hyphen;horizon radar, which is the subject of some Auditor&hyphen;General's reports currently before the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is large expenditure on a new joint headquarters really justified in our present strategic circumstances?</PARA>
<PARA>I would agree with that. I think command and control arrangements really have got out of hand and we need, as a government, particularly, to look at that. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Has the HQADF grown too large at the expense of the three Services' ability to provide their deep expertise on matters of policy?</PARA>
<PARA>I think maybe there is a modicum of truth in that, although we do need to press down the joint approach. Finally, he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From an industry point of view, when is Defence going to give more than lip service to the Government's policy of providing industry with much clearer strategic guidance and bringing industry into the planning process much earlier?</PARA>
<PARA>Those are important points to make in the context of a debate which is not only related to the officer corps. I agree with the right honourable gentleman that the `military after next' is a very catchy phrase; it is appropriate under the circumstances. It is important also to make mention of some of these points in a wider portfolio, a wider strategic viewpoint, because young people like those we have here today need to understand some of these things.</PARA>
