<ELECTORATE> (Scullin)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(9.31 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During this debate there has been much talk of mandates to govern&mdash;mandates to implement policies. The government claims that it has a mandate to privatise one-third of Telstra. On 2 March I received endorsement from the electors of Scullin after having campaigned against such a claim. I, too, claim a mandate from the people of Scullin to oppose the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill and the privatisation of Telstra.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like all opposition members and senators, I was open about and campaigned on my opposition to such a sale. The electors of Scullin have given me a mandate and expect and demand that I oppose this legislation. In addition to campaigning on my opposition to the Telstra sale, I campaigned on a series of environmental initiatives outlined before the election. Therefore, I can claim a mandate from the electors of Scullin for these environmental initiatives without the sale of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I reject the link that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has attempted to create between the proposed sale of one-third of Telstra and the protection of the environment. The sale of Telstra can in no way be considered a prerequisite for the conservation and repair of our natural environment. I especially reject his comments that opposing the sale of Telstra could and should in any way be construed as an anti-environmental act. I find the Prime Minister's assertions in this regard particularly offensive to those who have always been concerned about environmental issues. This claim of a link comes from a person who just four years ago was saying that Australia's economic progress was being held up by excessive concern for the environment and this position was exacerbated by skewed media coverage of ecological issues. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is somewhat ironic that the government is now trying to create this link between Telstra and the environment and portray itself as Australia's environmental guardian when, in opposition, the coalition consistently opposed every major environmental step undertaken by the previous government. Mining at Coronation Hill would have proceeded. Uluru and Kakadu would have been handed back to the Northern Territory government instead of to indigenous Australians. The wet tropics would have been logged and the Franklin flooded. Talk of abolishing the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency reveals the government's true colours. Environmental issues have always been regarded as state issues by the coalition and no amount of false, new found concern for the environment will change that at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The so-called most innovative environmental program ever invented actually contains the initiatives that were already promised and committed to by the previous Labor government without the sale of Telstra. For example, the previous government had committed $173 million to conserve and protect biodiversity in Australia in the conserving natural Australia package. This package included the same $80 million over four years to the national reserve system that the government intends to pay for with the proceeds of the Telstra sale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sustaining rural Australia component of Labor's environment policy provided an additional $176.5 million for landcare. The policy also provided for $98 million of funding for the Murray-Darling Basin initiative that the government now wants to fund from Telstra sale proceeds. Along with the states, over $300 million has already been injected into this project. The national river health program was to support the national water audit now proposed by the government. The other so-called innovative initiatives were all being funded or had been committed to by the previous government without the sale of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a number of reservations about the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia, which is to be established with $1 billion from the proceeds of the Telstra sale. I note in passing, despite the calls of the supremacy of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="532"> parliament over the executive, the government is treating the parliament with disdain in that the enabling legislation of the Natural Heritage Trust is not before us at the same time as this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of the $1 billion that is to be set up in the trust, $300 million will remain in the trust in perpetuity. That leaves $700 million over five years or $140 million per annum to fund this array of so-called innovative initiatives. The government has offered no commitment to replenish the Natural Heritage Trust once the five years is over and this initial expenditure is exhausted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are other unanswered questions about the trust once this money is spent. The amount of $300 million is to remain in the trust and accumulated interest to be used to fund further environmental projects. Is this to be the government's only expenditure on the environment? The truth is that, in essence, the trust is a one&hyphen;off expenditure program for the environment using some of the Telstra sale proceeds with no serious long&hyphen;term commitment to the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Should the House be fooled by some shonky artificial link between the environment and the sale of Telstra? Shouldn't we see that this is a confidence trick to allow for the ideological obsession of privatisation for privatisation's sake? During the eighties and nineties, Telstra was subjected to extremely radical changes by the previous Labor government. It has been fully corporatised and exposed to competition by the introduction of Optus. It will face local call competition and a further deregulated environment at the end of 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From time to time, I have expressed my concern in this place that competition and corporatisation do not necessarily deliver benefits to consumers. However, if in the context of this debate I were to accept that this is true, then surely the perceived benefits must already be accruing to consumers due to the changes already implemented. This being the case, one must ask: what is the real agenda here? Why pursue the privatisation of Telstra when consumers are feeling the benefits of competition and deregulation already? </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is nothing further deregulatory or competitive that cannot be implemented with Telstra remaining in full public ownership. The revolution in telecommunications over the last decade has proved that. So the reason for this sale is the ideology behind it: the government is in favour of the sale of Telstra for the sale's sake. It cannot be that it thinks there are any more benefits for consumers to reap. Experience with privatisation of other telecommunications companies elsewhere in the world would indicate the opposite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Take, for example, the sale of British Telecom. I note that in the Senate yesterday the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) said that government legislation to partially privatise Telstra was based on the British model. In his speech introducing this legislation, the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith) mentioned the special incentives for individuals and Telstra employees to purchase shares.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who bought the shares in British Telecom? As at 31 May 1985, 76 per cent of shareholders were small&mdash;holding less than 800 shares&mdash;but this was hardly the people's capitalism promised by Mrs Thatcher when you consider that these shareholders only held 7.8 per cent of the total shareholding. Nor was it workers capitalism. British Telecom employees hold only two per cent of shares. The bulk of the shares were purchased by institutional investors, and the number of investors dramatically decreased over time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In November 1984, there were 2.1 million shareholders of British Telecom. By May 1986 this figure had declined to 1,582,000. But some things did increase when British Telecom was first privatised in 1984. One was the salary of the chief executive. In 1984 Sir George Jeefereson earned &pound;84,198; in 1985 he earned &pound;111,399&mdash;an increase of 32 per cent; in 1986 his salary was &pound;172,206&mdash;an increase of 55 per cent. The same person also has shares in British Telecom, estimated in the late eighties to be worth &pound;750,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other things to increase following the privatisation of British Telecom were the cost of local calls, the cost of coin box calls, the cost of residential connections and the cost of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="533"> business connections. No wonder there was widespread dissatisfaction among consumers&mdash;private and business&mdash;with the performance of British Telecom.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In November 1985 British Telecom claimed that its price increases would be an average of 3.7 per cent. However, the British government's own communications watchdog, the Office of Telecommunications, Oftel, stated that these increases would mean average bills would rise by around seven per cent. The government's assurances that such a scenario could not happen here because of safeguards in this legislation are not convincing or reassuring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">British Telecom's licence from the British government said that certain charges could only be raised by four per cent, but it did not stop huge increases in trunk calls at the standard rate of 18.3 per cent, pushing the overall average call costs up. Oftel in Britain concluded that the price increases would affect those who telephone least, such as pensioners. The board of the privatised British Telecom sought to maximise profits by staff cuts and decreases in customer service standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the first two years after privatisation, the work force of British Telecom declined by 10,800. The latest figures show that the staffing levels in British Telecom now stand at little over 50 per cent of the original 1984 levels. One can also compare those staffing levels with the New Zealand experience. Telecom New Zealand's reductions have been even greater&mdash;the staff numbers being halved since Telecom New Zealand was privatised in 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the British Telecom case, the cuts were across all areas&mdash;operators, engineers, technical staff and apprentices. The bill before us does not address the issue of what is an acceptable level of staff to guarantee satisfactory levels of customer service. In the case of Telecom New Zealand, where, as I have indicated, the reductions in staff were quite large, between 1993 and 1995 the fault clearance rate&mdash;faults cleared by 5 p.m. the following day&mdash;went from 95 per cent to 58.3 per cent. The problems largely arose from the pace at which the capital/labour replacement <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> was being attempted. So consumers in that case had a diminution&mdash;or, in the words of this bill, a dilution&mdash;of service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The upshot of staff cuts is, of course, the stinging erosion of standards. They mean longer waiting times for the installation and repair of equipment and longer waiting times for an available operator. As a public enterprise, British Telecom had a strong `buy British' policy. Of British Telecom's equipment requirements, 95 per cent were met within the United Kingdom. With the trend towards the maximisation of profits, equipment purchases are viewed on a worldwide scale. This has had a devastating effect on the local British manufacturers of digital exchanges, as has the 11.5 per cent cut in the research and development program undertaken in 1986. Why would we imagine that in Australia we would not have a similar result?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Exports from the electronic industry in Australia rose from $50 million in 1983 to currently $1 billion per annum. This export growth to a large degree is Telstra driven. It results from the investment of Telstra in local industry and its commitment to excellence in Australia. We cannot expect a privatised Telstra to continue along this path.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The story of British Telecom is a story of what occurs when essentially a community service is privatised. It is a story that can be expected here in Australia. The Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government in his second reading speech was slavishly trotting out the dry economic speak when he talked about consumer safeguards, shareholder oversight and worker and small shareholder participation in the privatisation. Time and time again privatisations such as that which is envisaged for Telstra fail to deliver in any of these areas. This is because, at the end of the day, the only obligation of the privatised company is to maximise its profits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government cannot instruct the board to act against its own interests and act uncommercially. Therefore, all talk of safeguards, community service obligations and inclusive capitalism go out the window. The case would be no different if Telstra were privatised. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="534">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the course of this week the Prime Minister has been saying that a vote against the Telstra legislation is a vote against the environment. He places this claim on the $1 billion that will be taken from the sale of this first third of Telstra and given to the trust fund. If we have a look at the dividends that have been paid by Telstra directly into the budget, we can see that some interesting figures have developed. In 1991-92, the dividend was $478 million; in 1992-93, $674 million; in 1993-94, $738 million; and in 1994-95, $944 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Without wishing to oversimplify what perhaps is a complex equation, if we take the dividend of 1994-95&mdash;$944 million&mdash;and look at the sale of one-third of Telstra and extrapolate that a reduction of a third in the dividend is to be payable to government, we would have in that year a reduction to the budget of $300 million. So, even if we were to use vaguely this figure, over a three&hyphen;year period we would have the $1 billion. But what is to be spent on this environment package is only $700 million over a five-year period. So the contention of this government that in some way a vote against this piece of legislation is to deny additional funding that the environment package deserves is a nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is about privatisation for privatisation's sake. It is about a government that has consistently championed placing those things that are in public ownership into private ownership. Despite the assurance that the sale of one-third of Telstra will not be revisited until after the next election, one can be sure that it will be revisited&mdash;and it will be revisited again. It may be that a whole two-thirds goes up for sale in one grab, or that one&hyphen;third is sold and then another third is sold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Surely the Australian public next time will not take the same sort of nonsense, that is, a proposal to sell a third of Telstra with some gimmick attached to it&mdash;a tail on the dog that wags the dog. The dog in this case is the sale of a public company. This is about privatisation for privatisation's sake. This piece of legislation should be opposed.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Having heard the contribution of members opposite to this privatisation debate, I must say that I had <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to go back to the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill to make sure that we are talking about the same thing. This is not about the privatisation of British Telecom. This regards something that was put forward by the then Leader of the Opposition to the Australian people as part of the policy of the Liberal Party in the lead-up to the election. Part of that policy, stated categorically and clearly, was the intention to partially privatise Telstra. I also had to return to the second reading speech of the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith), because some of the assertions made by members opposite were just outrageous. It does not look to me like we are talking about the same bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I get to the substance of my speech, I should make clear my view about the hypocrisy shown by members opposite. Those on the opposition benches who have spoken on this bill have repeatedly stated that what the coalition government is trying to achieve is virtually going to bring the end of mankind forward by millenniums. I just don't understand what they are saying. At the time of the proposed sale of the Commonwealth Bank, why was it that not one member opposite expressed their concern?  I can understand that those who were not members of the government at the time did not have much say about it, but why did they not express their opposition to it?  Those who were members of the government at the time said nothing in the party room, in the parliament or publicly in opposition to the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. The sale of Qantas gave members opposite another opportunity to express their opposition. Again, they said nothing at any stage.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You interjected and I responded to your interjection, though I will continue to make my remarks through the chair. You said nothing about it&mdash;absolutely nothing. You said nothing in your speech today about these issues. Of the $8 billion <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="535"> that the partial privatisation of Telstra will bring to the people of Australia, $1 billion will go towards saving the environment. We should all be ashamed of the environment that 13 years of federal Labor government has left us with. The remaining $7 billion will be used to retire overseas debt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another great shame is the overseas debt left to us to sort out by those opposite. On the latest figures available&mdash;for the year 1994-95&mdash;Australia's exports totalled approximately $45.8 billion and our imports approximately $45.7 billion. So Australia paid its way by about $100 million last year, which is a good achievement. However, the problem is that once we add to that the cost of the foreign interest bill and the service debt, we keep going into the red more and more. It has got to stop.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we keep going in this way, at what stage will the IMF step in and say to Australia, `Enough is enough. We cannot let you continue down this path, building a huge foreign debt'? When the Labor government took office in 1983 the foreign debt was about $23 billion. At present it is about $185 billion. At what stage will the IMF say, `We are going to step in'? It is one thing for Australia to lose its AAA credit rating&mdash;which it has&mdash;but we have to keep in mind that, as a result, the cost of borrowing overseas goes up exponentially. Instead of opposing the partial sale of Telstra, the opposition should be expressing their contriteness to the Australian people and expressing how sorry they are that the foreign debt has ballooned and blown out to such an extent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to talk down the Australian economy; that does not do any of us any good. But we have to make some advances in reducing our foreign debt. That is the best way of saying to the world economies, to the foreign banks, that we are taking the necessary steps as quickly as we can to start to remove the albatross from around Australia's neck.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Average voters are not tuned in to the fancy economic jargon that was bandied about by the former Prime Minister, but they are highly perceptive. They are willing to give their elected representatives a fair go, but they  are <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> just as ready to make a change if it is their view that the government is just not performing. Not only was the Keating government not performing; it was also sending our nation into the depths of despair. Those opposite suffered a landslide loss. I recently read a newspaper commentary which referred to it as an avalanche. We can see opposite what is left of the once proud Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How much more credibility&mdash;much needed credibility&mdash;would the opposition have exhibited had they come out and said to the coalition government, `Let's work together to make Telstra more cost efficient and therefore reduce costs to the mums and dads of Australia and to businesses&mdash;large, medium and small'? Why have members opposite said nothing about the financial performance of Telstra?  They have not once referred to it. It is not a secret. Extensive documentation was tabled in the Senate in November or December last year. Why have those opposite not referred to the economic performance of Telstra?  Telstra's official corporate plan for the three years to June 1998 publicly showed a very glowing picture. The reality is quite different. We all know that the inefficiencies of monopolies take a long time to show up, but show up they have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to refer to some of the matters that were raised by the Chief Executive of Telstra, Mr Blount, in a leaked memo to his executive committee. It indicated that Telstra was heading for a shortfall in cashflow for 1995-96 of $1.1 billion and a shortfall in earnings before interest and tax of $534 million. Why did the opposition say nothing about the problem that Telstra will have to live with&mdash;that is, a blow-out in the cost of the roll&hyphen;out of cables? The memo made some mention about staff. It said that other global telecommunications giants are seriously reducing numbers and Telstra actually employed an additional 8,000 people last year. Why doesn't the opposition say anything about that? In talking about British Telecom, they seem to have forgotten that we are talking about an Australian monopoly that is just not performing. Why don't they talk about that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Something else I want to raise which I think is very important relates to the slashing <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="536"> of profits in Telstra. Once that happens there is only one way of adjusting the problem&mdash;that is, to raise costs. Why hasn't the opposition said anything about the impending cost rises? In response to my question about Telstra which I asked last week, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said that consumers all over the world are deriving large benefits by way of lower prices and better access to new telecommunication services through a combination of competition and the injection of private sector capital in the telecommunications companies. That is a worldwide trend. It is not something that the opposition just made up for the sake of making something up. This is a fact. It is not an assertion from the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer the House to a report dated March 1995 published by the Bureau of Industry Economics, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the introduction of competition in telecommunications Australia has moved ahead with the leading pack, but it is at the back of the leading group rather than the front. Relaxing the pace of reform would see Australia fall back into the trailing group of also-rans. Renewed effort is required to lift Australia towards international best practice.</PARA>
<PARA>I want to turn to the major assurances given in the bill, especially in the minister's second reading speech, which surely no-one could be opposed to. Even the opposition should applaud the guarantees given. The share float is limited. There will not be a total privatisation. There will be partial privatisation in which one-third of the Commonwealth's equity will be made available through a share float and 65 per cent of that will be reserved for Australian investors as A&hyphen;class shares.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Incentives will be provided to all Australian citizens and Telstra employees. I want to stress that. It will give the employees of Telstra the opportunity of buying into the company that they are part of. Telstra will not be broken up. British Telecom was broken up, but Australian Telstra will not be broken up. Guarantees have been given that the majority of the board of directors will be Australian citizens. In fact, an Australian citizen will be the chairman of the board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In regard to excessive management remuneration, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, in your <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> speech you referred to some very large pay rises given to some members of British Telecom, but obviously you did not read the bill. The bill has made it very clear. It says that the government will reserve the right to veto any excessive management remuneration. That includes the chairman of the board and the board of directors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer to community service obligations. Those opposite have a concern for the underprivileged and for those who are not capable of looking after themselves in life. Why has no-one on the other side said anything at all about the community service obligations that will apply in the bill? Absolutely nothing was said by anyone on the other side about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a lot of talk about timed local calls. Again, I must refer to the hypocrisy of members opposite. In the election campaign for my own seat flyers were put out saying, `Vote for the coalition, vote for Zammit and vote for the Liberal Party and you will get timed local calls.' In fact, we made it very clear that that would not apply. It was just a matter of repeatedly putting out lies by the Labor Party. The slogan that is very widespread&mdash;`Labor lies'&mdash;has caught on very well. Mr Deputy Speaker, you should have known in your seat that that was part of the coalition's policy. The person who was running against me, the former member for Lowe, repeatedly put out flyers, handing them out at shopping centres, saying, `We are going to have timed local calls if you vote for the coalition, Zammit or the Liberal Party.' We made it perfectly clear that that would not occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, this morning you raised the issue of price gaps. You said that if this bill goes through the cost of calls will become astronomical. I do not remember what percentage you put on it. Again, you did not bother to read the bill. There are guarantees in the bill that make it very clear that that will just not occur. There will be existing caps and they will be maintained. Price controls have been outlined. The coalition stated exactly what was said by those opposite as part of your policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="537"> The last point I want to refer to is competition. It is going to be regulated and adminis tered by a specialist branch of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. This partial sale of Telstra will result both in a reduction in debt and in repair to the environment. I want to challenge members opposite when they say that nothing will happen with the $1 billion and that even if it does go ahead what are we going to do with it? I want to reverse that view of those opposite and say to them that the environment needs to be repaired. It has been badly neglected and we should be ashamed of ourselves as Australians for what we have done to our environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If that $1 billion from the partial sale of Telstra is not available then it is incumbent on the opposition to say how they, in government&mdash;if that should ever occur in the foreseeable future&mdash;would allocate the funds to repair the environment. Where would the billion dollars come from? Would you take a billion dollars out of hospitals? Would you take a billion dollars out of social security? Where would the billion dollars come from? There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that this Telstra policy was clearly and carefully thought through and detailed sufficiently prior to the election to allow debate on it prior to the election. Now that the voters have decided that they want a coalition government, I believe it is vitally important that those opposite allow the coalition government to proceed with the very important mandate that was given to us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The last point I want to make concerns cost efficiency. No-one opposite has said anything at all about cost efficiency in Telecom, and they should. The rejection of this bill by the then Keating government was decided prior to the election. They made a lot of mistakes in government and I think this is another major mistake, another major blunder. I urge members opposite, especially the newer members, to reconsider this issue. They do not have to be bound by mistakes that occurred under the Keating Labor government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find curious at the outset how the coalition is seeking to reinvent itself with respect to the environment. I have the misfortune of having once occupied the government benches but now having to see life from a different side. In the course of those years in government, I was confronted by opposition from the now government on a whole range of issues which we put forward as being appropriate for a response to ensure that we did have a credible environmental record. Persistently and consistently over all those years our initiatives were rejected. They were not just rejected lightly or frivolously; they were rejected antagonistically.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I go back to the days when there were debates regarding issues as simple as Fraser Island, the south&hyphen;west of Tasmania, Kakadu, the wet tropics and Wesley Vale&mdash;all of the major national achievements which were protected by dint of the effort of the former Hawke and Keating governments. Those achievements were made the subject of derision and ridicule by the now government parties. I find it indeed strange that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) rises at question time to seek to make some political advantage out of his commitment to link the funding of his environmental package to the sale of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister says that there are only two parties in Australia, the Liberal and National parties, who have any credibility on the environment. I think that is a complete distortion of reality. The word `hypocrisy' flies around quite lightly in these debates&mdash;I have heard it frequently uttered as I have watched the screen as speakers have risen&mdash;but I cannot imagine it being more aptly applied than to those members of the coalition who came forward on each of those occasions to castigate the then government on the basis that we had ignored the interests of Australia's export industries, that we had failed to recognise the interests of those who were involved in residential development, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="538"> mining, or some other development in some of these fragile areas, and that we had put the interests of a small minority, as they often put it, to the fore of the national interest. They now confront us with a proposition that they hold the torch of true belief on environmental issues. The truth is that that is platitudinous nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was only in the run-up to the last federal campaign, when the coalition realised that it had to have some mechanism of addressing the many millions of Australians who do give priority to the environment, that a stratagem had to be devised to give some comfort to those people and to seriously address the imbalance that we had achieved electorally. People who did have a concern for the environment consistently voted for the Labor Party either as a first preference party or after voting for other parties as a second preference because of the issue of the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what was devised? A crude political stratagem that would be placed before the Australian public so that those who believed that the environment was truly a national priority would be comforted&mdash;but that comfort would be given at a price; that is, a commitment to sell one of Australia's national assets. That was correctly described by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) as blackmail. In other words, you could have something approaching an environmental policy from the coalition but only at the price of being willing to accept the sale of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that there is nothing in the $1 billion environmental package that is anything other than a continuation of programs previously delivered by successive Labor administrations entirely funded through general revenue. Let us make that point crystal clear: there is nothing in the $1 billion package that does anything different, raises any new issues or confronts and addresses any new policy agendas other than those which were being addressed consistently and over time by major initiatives funded entirely out of general revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are now confronted with this rhetorical flourish that says the only way in which the environment will receive any attention from the coalition is if it is made conditional upon <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the sale of Telstra. Why such a proposition? Because the coalition knows that there is little popular support for the sale of Telstra and massive public support for programs designed to redress the environmental imbalance that has occurred not because of failures in the 13 years of Labor administrations but because of the way in which this country developed historically, because of our population growth along the coasts and the fact that we do need to build programs now, firstly, to preserve those sorts of areas which have wilderness and international importance and, secondly, to make sure that we do have adequate programs to address what you might call the agricultural and rural issues of salination and river silting and the brown issues of inner city sewerage and the like.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These issues should be addressed not as an add-on to social policy but as a first&hyphen;line initiative to be funded by government, whatever the economic circumstances are. If it is not integrated into the mainstream of government policy making, the environment becomes that optional extra you get if you can do certain other unpalatable things. That is all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Frankly, that kind of approach distresses me. It distresses me because for years and years as the then only Labor member for the state of Tasmania I was subjected to vilification by those on the other side because of the strong stands I took on the environment, because I spoke up and insisted upon adequate protection for the south&hyphen;west wilderness of Tasmania, because I stood up and recognised the inadequacy of the environmental guidelines for the Wesley Vale pulp mill and because I was willing to give voice to those constituents of mine who believed that there had to be a reconciliation of the interests of both employment and the environment and that the Labor movement was the appropriate vehicle to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I received continual attacks from colleagues now in government who derided this, claimed that attention to the environment was a marginal and peripheral issue pandering to minority groups, claimed that the Wesley Vale pulp mill should have proceeded irrespective of the inadequacy of the EIS and the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="539"> failure of the company to address the issues of its effluence and derided us because we were seeking to find some accommodation which meant that there would be a significant and important forestry industry in Tasmania but not at the cost of the wilderness areas of that state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those battles persisted into the last term of the Keating government. During that term, when this parliament was surrounded by log trucks, we saw the almost embarrassing performance of the coalition parties seeking to make issue of the discomfort of a government which was seeking to make sure that the environment was taken into account as a central issue of government policy. These are hard decisions. These are not easy decisions. These decisions require balances. These decisions are often resisted by sections of the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are not decisions to be bought by a bribe of $1 billion, which really represents only about 2&half; years of the program costs that we were committing in any case to major environmental improvements. They are not to be bought for that price conditional upon doing something which is odious to the whole of the Australian community. Why is it odious to the Australian community? Telstra is not only one of Australia's key national infrastructure assets but also a company which delivers services across Australia on an egalitarian basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had the benefit of listening to a number of speeches in this House and in the Senate. I do not want to go through all of the matters that have been canvassed regarding the way in which Telstra is significant in terms of economic training opportunities for those entering the technological industries for the future. I do not want to go through the arguments about how Telstra in this new environment will be forced into significant labour shedding. I do not want to go through the arguments that the selling of Telstra will in fact provide a windfall capital gain at the cost of taxpayers to those who are rich enough in the Australian community to secure share&hyphen;owning assets and, more particularly, to overseas investors who will get the opportunity to own a share of Australia's national <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> interest&mdash;not, as the then opposition promised, on a share basis that would be differentiated from Australian share owners, class B shares, but rather on the same shareholder basis as Australian residents will be entitled to. All those points have been adequately canvassed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to focus on the effect on regional economies. At the moment Telstra operates in much the same way as Australia Post; that is, it absorbs some of the cost differentials between country and regional Australia and urban Australia and then charges out many of its services on a flat basis. The most important of those are connection fees. Now why is this important? It is important in the same way that it is important that people are able to put a 45c stamp on a letter from anywhere in Australia and not pay a premium. If you live in Mount Isa, Bendigo or King Island, then it is true that on any cost measurement it must be more expensive to post from those destinations to other parts of Australia than it is for mail that can be directed quickly between Sydney and Melbourne. But there would be an outcry if we were to charge differentially for Australia Post services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why, at the bottom line, there is an inevitable resistance from regional Australia to the privatisation of Telstra. It is easy to have glib rhetoric. I am assisted in this point by my colleague the honourable member for Bass (Mr Warwick Smith), sitting at the table. I like my colleague the honourable member for Bass. I regard him as a very personable man with whom I have had effective and good&hyphen;spirited dealings over a long period of time. But Mr Smith as the member for Bass campaigned during the last election on the basis that electorates such as his would be benefited by the general economic policies that were being put forward by coalition parties. Unfortunately, the test of these kinds of assertions ought to be judged by outcomes rather than rhetoric. I think the Americans have the language: they say, `It is easy to talk the talk; harder to walk the walk'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Launceston already, as a result of the cost reduction impacts that are occurring, there has been the closure of the Launceston tax office. There has been a decision within the Family Court, prompted by the cost&hyphen; <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="540">cutting measures contained in the coalition's promises prior to the election, which at the very least will savagely reduce the services to residents of the north and north&hyphen;west of Tasmania and most probably result in the closure of the northern registry of the Family Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Taking this further, once a company such as Telstra is privatised then inevitably the pressures to recover costs in terms of actual expenditure on services will increase, and the impact on regional economies such as Launceston will be enormous. Take the honourable member's own seat of Bass. He has a number of isolated areas&mdash;for instance, Flinders Island. The actual connect cost for a phone line is $4,930. For Scottsdale it is $1,270, and for Launceston itself, because it is a regional centre and not a major urban centre, the connect cost is $730.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is nothing in the legislation that is proposed by the coalition that obliges the maintenance of a system of averaging&mdash;nothing. A number of community service obligations are spelled out, but nothing prevents the flow on of a decision to actually cost recover at real rates the cost of the introduction of those services to regional Australia. You can go through electorate after electorate and see that people in Sydney and Melbourne will not be particularly disadvantaged by this aspect of the legislation, but regional Australia will be savagely disadvantaged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We only hear the talking of the talk. What happens once this policy is in place will turn on what the directors of the new privatised company will do and, whilst they will have an obligation to report to the minister, they will have no obligation to accept any directions. So Mr Smith will do as he did with the Family Court; he will say, `That is an independent, self&hyphen;managed organisation. We have set up a policy framework; we have insisted they absorb cuts. The fact it is happening in my own home city I can do nothing about.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it is a direct consequence of the policy settings that the government has made. There is a direct link between a policy and an election commitment to take $2 million off the Family Court and trim its running costs by <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> two per cent further and the necessity to make savings. And those savings to be made by an independent board will fall most directly on regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will hear the same bleating from regional members who are now speaking of the benefits of the Telstra privatisation when an independent board of a private telephone company starts racking up the connect costs in electorate after electorate, region after region, across rural and semi&hyphen;rural Australia. We will hear the same excuse: `There may be a national interest, but I can't do anything about it because it is an independent board and the minister does not even have power of direction.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In concluding my contribution to this debate&mdash;and many other contributions have set these points out&mdash;I say that there are many great reasons we need to maintain a strong and independent Australian owned and community owned telephone service. To link its sale to the environment is, in my view, a complete distortion of the historical processes that have occurred over the last 10 years and a sleight on the intelligence of the electorate. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I make my prepared comments I will take up a few of the points that were raised by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr). It is interesting that the gentleman referred to his view of the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith), who is at the table, a fellow Tasmanian of his, and how at a personal level he got on so well with him but obviously had some policy differences. The gentleman from Denison and I have served on a number of committees and we have shared some interests in a number of policy areas over the last five or six years. We have a good personal relationship, but I would have to say that I was very disappointed with a number of the points he had to make today. I will comment on a couple of those.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fundamental thing is that there still appears to be a view on that side of the chamber that we on this side always act in bad faith&mdash;that we do not have the care and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="541"> the concern, that we are all about the bottom line and not broader issues. I tell him that he is wrong. He knows from our own personal dealings, in Aboriginal affairs and other areas, that that is not the case. I would gently chastise him, perhaps, for taking that view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not into the environment because it is fashionable. We are not into the environment because it is politically expedient. The reality is that many of our members&mdash;many of the new members on this side of the House&mdash;with our vast majority, which the honourable member for Denison does not like of course, are regional members who well understand the significance of the environment, what we have done to this country in the last 200 years and the need to repair much of that damage. We are not into blackmail. We are into looking at how we can fund the major expenditure that is necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that he talks about the closure of the Launceston tax office. That was a decision by the previous government, of which he was a minister. We need to understand that that is the case. As I understand it, the closure of the court in Launceston is not a final decision at this time. It has not happened. To stand up here and say those things to this government, which has had less than a fortnight in parliament, is absolutely misleading.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He talks about the problems of us selling national assets as if it is some convention that has just been dreamt up from nowhere. I remind the chamber that when those on the other side were in government until very recently, when the previous member was a member of the Labor government, they sold Qantas. In spite of having said publicly that they would not, they sold the Commonwealth Bank. Selling off national assets for good reason is in fact not a heresy. It is something they have done. For them to come into this place, having the record they have, and make comments to us about the immoral or improper aspect of selling off national assets is, frankly, total hypocrisy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Denison asked, `Why can't you fund your environment policy through general revenue?' I ask the member opposite where the money is coming from. I remind <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> him that his government handed over to this government an $8 billion black hole. At the moment we are trying to see where we can find the government revenue that is necessary in a whole range of areas. To have extra spending on the environment you have to look for new ways of finding that money. We made the commitment that we would not increase taxes&mdash;it is a commitment we will stick to&mdash;and, therefore, we have to find alternatives. Quite clearly, we said to the electorate that this was how we would fund it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not a question of saying, `Why don't you spend money on the environment out of general revenue like we did?' We have said that this extra $1 billion, which will come from the sale of Telstra, is to set up a trust fund, in addition to existing environmental expenditure. It is not a replacement for; it is an addition to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that the member for Denison totally misrepresents the truth of the situation. When he talks about `talking the talk' and about the lack of control over Telstra under the new arrangement, he fails to mention that it will have a majority of Australian directors. He also fails to understand or admit that under his government, whether you talked about Australia Post, Telstra or anything else, or whether it was government controlled or `independent', the reality was that those organisations were not responsible to the minister. When I raised queries with the minister, quite frequently he came back and said, `It is an independent or semi&hyphen;independent or part&hyphen;privatised or corporatised body and I have no control.' So that is a total furphy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems that there is a lot of misunderstanding in the community about this bill. There is an emotive reaction to electioneering talk and people naturally shy away from selling off one of our major assets. It is therefore important that we look at the detail of this bill. If the community understands it, they will find that it is not the terrible crime portrayed by the Australian Democrats or the Labor Party, who, without looking at the detail, said no to this bill well in advance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is about the need to inject fresh capital into Telstra so it can be more <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="542"> effective, not only to be more competitive in this country and give a better service to us, the Australian taxpayers, but also so it can expand and be more profitable in the growing Asian market. It is about the need to make Telstra more competitive at all levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also about the need to find new money, firstly, to pay for a world&hyphen;class environment policy and, secondly, to help this nation's saving situation by putting $7 billion or thereabouts into reducing debt&mdash;debt which has grown astronomically over the 13 years of the previous government. That not only reduces the burden that we are passing on to our children but it also has an immediate beneficial impact on the budget bottom line because we will not be paying so much interest on that debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is about keeping our election promises. The previous government learnt, to its cost, that if you do not do that, the people will not vote for you again in sufficient numbers. It is about keeping faith with the people who elected us. We went to the people with a clear position on this issue and we will implement the policy that we were elected to do so. It is legislation for which we quite clearly have a mandate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra's performance has been much better since it had a bit of competition in the last few years but there is no doubt that, compared with many other telecommunication organisations around the world and compared with where it was before it was exposed to competition, service time, installation time and the quality of service are not up to scratch. Its installation costs and pricing structure will be improved only by competition, by being exposed to a greater competitive market and by being run as a private business much more so than it is at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous protection and overstaffing have been at a cost to the consumer&mdash;which is you and I as ordinary Australians&mdash;and by world standards it is not doing well compared with other telecommunications organisations. It is interesting to see that of the 20 largest such organisations in the world, Telstra is the only one that has not been at least partially privatised. I repeat: this is about competition, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> better service, debt clearance, developing Telstra, developing the environment and keeping our word on election promises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously, it is not possible with a large piece of legislation to go through every piece of the bill, but I would like to talk a little bit this morning about the share ownership aspects. It is important that people understand that we are not going to flog off Telstra to overseas interests, that we are not giving up our sovereignty in economic terms or any other way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given Telstra's vital continuing strategic role in our economy, the long&hyphen;term national interest demands that it is not simply sold off to the highest bidder. It must remain Australian owned and controlled. That is the area I want to talk about this morning. This bill ensures that Telstra will remain an Australian owned and controlled company. That will be achieved, firstly, by restricting foreign ownership of shares and, secondly, by requiring that Telstra continues to operate from Australia with a majority of board members being Australian.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The foreign ownership restrictions mean that of the one&hyphen;third of the Telstra shares that can be offered for sale, only 35 per cent can be taken up by foreign investors, and that individual foreign investors will be unable to hold more than five per cent of non&hyphen;Commonwealth shares. The net effect of the foreign ownership rules will be that Telstra will remain at least 88 per cent Australian owned with aggregate foreign investment not exceeding 11.7 per cent of all share equity in Telstra and with no individual foreign investor having more than a 1.7 per cent stake in the company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Particularly important is the sale process which will provide special incentives for individual Australians and Telstra employees to invest in their company. As part of the sale process, the government will examine appropriate mechanisms to enable the allocation of Telstra shares to a wide spread of Australian investors, including institutional investors and members of the Australian community. There are also special provisions in the bill to cover the possible situation where Telstra shares are sold in more than one tranche.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="543">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this event, regulations can prescribe a lower threshold for aggregate and individual foreign ownership, ensuring that Australian investors can take up 65 per cent of the shares on offer in each tranche. As part of the scoping study for the sale, the government will consider whether to divide Telstra shares into special classes, with foreign investors being unable to hold shares in a particular class. For the purposes of the foreign ownership rules, which is always a complicated area as we have seen from the media in recent years, a person's ownership stake in Telstra shares will include all legal and equitable interests in Telstra shares, all indirect interests&mdash;in other words, interests that can be traced through a corporate investment chain&mdash;and all interest held by a person's associates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, it is no good having the most stringent ownership rules around if you do not have enforcement. So the foreign ownership limits are supported by a range of enforcement and remedial provisions. These include: strict offence and anti&hyphen;avoidance provisions; obligations on Telstra to ensure compliance; powers for the minister and Telstra to obtain injunctions to prevent or remedy ownership breaches; and powers for the Federal Court to issue divestment orders. The bill also enables regulations to be made so that the minister or Telstra can obtain information for the purpose of ensuring compliance within foreign ownership limits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The statutory information powers will enable Telstra to look beyond its share register and to identify relevant interests held indirectly by foreign persons through intervening companies. They will also enable Telstra to meet its statutory obligation to prevent and remedy breaches of the foreign ownership provisions. The government is confident that these enforcement and remedial provisions will provide an effective and rigorous regime for regulating foreign ownership of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think all Australians are concerned about keeping Telstra based in Australia, so the foreign ownership restrictions are complemented by provisions which ensure that Telstra's central management and control base of operations and incorporation remain in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australia and its chairman and the majority of other directors are Australian citizens. These measures will mean that, even while competing on the world markets, Telstra will continue to operate out of Australia and will retain its Australian identity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Requiring that most of the Telstra shares are taken up by Australian investors and obliging Telstra to be managed and controlled from Australia will enable the company to be truly an Australian company. There is no reason why Telstra, in an open, competitive environment and with the stimulus provided by private equity, should not grow into a leading regional and international provider of communications and information services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that it really is quite straightforward. As the minister, who is at the table, laid out so carefully and precisely in his second reading speech on the bill, we have consumer safeguards. We are going to keep Telstra Australian. We have shareholder oversight. We have detailed sales provisions. We have customer service guarantees. We have funding of the Natural Heritage Trust. We are getting our debt down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other and final point that I would make is that we have a very clear mandate for this. Not only do we have a mandate for this dated 2 March&mdash;I know that when I say what I am about to say the other side will object and say that nobody believes in polls&mdash;but also a poll on the front page of today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> clearly shows that since 2 March, when the electorate gave us an overwhelming mandate for this piece of legislation and a whole range of other pieces of legislation, we have gained support quite significantly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Victoria, from where I come&mdash;and there is no question that the Labor Party does better there than in any other state&mdash;the opposition is still getting only a miserable 39 per cent of the vote. The reality is that we picked up seats in Victoria in the last election and we have improved our position since 2 March. Quite clearly that is a vote of confidence in what the government is doing with this legislation and with other legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would suggest to the Australian Democrats that they would be better advised to stick to their campaigning slogan of `keeping <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="544"> the bastards honest' and make sure that we do implement our policy rather than going on the negative and destructive course on which they are engaged. I urge both the ALP and the Democrats to reconsider their position. I suggest to the Greens that if they really want to be irrelevant but vote against the best environmental package we have seen in this country for many a long day, they will merely demonstrate to the electorate that they are into power games and do not have a concern for the electorate and they will in future be obliterated. We need to support the legislation. The Australian people will remember those who tried to oppose it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a very bad piece of public policy. It is a bad piece of public policy on privatisation; it is a bad piece of public policy on the environment; it is a bad piece of public policy on industry; and it is a bad piece of public policy on communications. It is put forward by a government in the most cynical possible fashion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me go to why it is a bad piece of public policy on industry, because this needs to be clearly understood by the Australian electorate and it will become clearly understood over the next few months. Telstra, our second biggest corporation, stands absolutely at the heart of the Australian electronics industry which, over the last decade or so, has massively improved on its export performance and massively improved on its import replacement performance. Without Telstra in full public ownership it will go the way of the New Zealand electronics industry and the UK electronics industry when their main carriers were privatised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me go through a few statistics on that. Let me take the sales of locally manufactured telecommunications equipment and services. They have gone from $2.1 billion in 1991 to $4 billion a year and a bit ago. A more interesting picture can be seen on the exports. Australia's exports of telecommunications equipment and services stood at $50 million in 1983. They went to $280 million in 1990&hyphen;91, $970 million last year and will go $1.5 billion by the end of this century. What does <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> it all come off? It all comes off Telstra because Telstra requires domestically $2.3 billion every year off the Australian electronics industry. Every single electronics company that you go to around this country, and you can go to the lot of them, be they producing fibre optic cable, switches, multiplexes&mdash;all the plethora of equipment that goes into telecommunications&mdash;will sit you down for your briefing and it will start like this: 10 years ago we were 90 per cent dependent on Telstra, 10 per cent on the rest of the domestic market and/or exports. This year we are 50 per cent dependent on sales to Telstra and 50 per cent on exports or some other element of our domestic market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The critical thing is the 50 per cent on Telstra. What does that rely on? Does it rely on a piece of legislation? No, it does not. Does it rely on what is the optimal performance as far as Telstra is concerned in the price of the equipment that comes into it? No, it does not. What it relies on is essentially a gentleman's agreement, an understanding by the directors and management of Telstra that what the Australian government expects of it is that it will acquire domestically the bulk of its equipment and services. It can be no other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you go down the road of attempting to legislate this beyond best endeavours types of intentions, you will run foul of the entire movement of world liberalisation of trade over the last decade or so. You cannot do it without earning yourself massive retaliation. Can you do it if there is an obligation upon the directors of that company to have, as their first consideration, optimising the value of the operations for their shareholders? No, you cannot do it. Provided those directors can see that they have an Australian government concerned to do it and provided they do not have those other obligations, this performance continues. Remove that and the first thing that goes out the window is the obligation to acquire equipment and services domestically.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Britain&mdash;with a far stronger telecommunications industry than we have&mdash;started to privatise British Telecom, they started to acquire their equipment from the United States. That is the first thing that happened when they went to privatisation. The great <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="545"> British electronics industry, dependent upon those twin pillars of the British defence budget and the telecommunications industry purchasing policy of British Telecom, went out the door&mdash;for the obvious reason. The huge suppliers of that equipment in the United States, in Europe and elsewhere to their telecommunications companies can marginally cost their sales into other markets. That is exactly what would happen here. The moment any element of Telstra is privatised, that industry goes out the window.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That industry is now critical for jobs, job security and employment opportunities in at least three states, but it is important in all of them. It is critical in Victoria, South Australia and New South Wales, but important everywhere else. Telstra feeds the Australian electronics industry not only at the level of acquisition, but at the level of research and development. It does not matter what you say about getting up there and expressing the view that Telstra will still feel a sense of local domestic responsibility. It does not matter what you say about that. As time goes by, as has happened in every other country where this has occurred, Telstra directors will feel a responsibility not to that national interest but to their shareholders&mdash;and so they should. They have legal obligations. That is something that they are going to have to sit down and think their way through should this legislation get through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After the initial gestures in that direction, there is absolutely no doubt which direction they are going to take Telstra over time. That massive investment producing so much good growth&mdash;it is a great contributor to our enjoyment of a 10 per cent per annum increase in exports of elaborately transformed manufactures and services&mdash;is going to go out the window. If you actually look at the inwardness of those exports, the two great drivers of them are car parts exports and the Australian electronics industry. They are going to go straight out the window as a result of these decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> It is also bad communications policy, because the critical issue for business and our consumers is the price at which they receive services, and the sophistication that they enjoy <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in the communications industry. That is not a product of privatisation; that is a product of competition. The fact that STD call prices have been falling, the fact that international dialling prices have been falling, the fact that we are now going to experience in the not too distant future the first falls in the cost of local calls and the fact that we have got a lowering price for mobile telephony is in part a product of technological change, but massively a product of competition forcing the telecommunications companies to pass the product of that technological change on to the consumer. That is what is critical&mdash;competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next phase of competition is absolutely vital to that, and the government is attempting to doom this privatisation process in the midst of confusion about the direction of that policy. That has some implications&mdash;which I probably will not get on to&mdash;for the price that the government can look forward to get from the sale of this entity. But one thing is for certain: if you are trying to get a price, if you are trying to extract $8 billion from the Australian market for Telstra, you will sit down and you will compromise&mdash;it does not matter what you say and what assurances you give&mdash;that competition policy in order to secure that price. You will compromise what delivers to business and the Australian consumer the outcome in order to optimise the return that comes to you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The government have made a smart debating point during the course of this debate, in question time and elsewhere about the fact that we, as a government, privatised a substantial number of Australian publicly owned entities. They have asked: why, if you have privatised them, won't you privatise this? The logic of that position is you either believe that everything should be in the public sector or everything should be out of it. It raises an interesting question about a couple of undertakings of theirs. What does it mean for their undertaking that they will not privatise Australia Post? What does it mean for their undertaking that they will not sell the other two-thirds of Telstra? Or do they somehow believe that they can have a one-third sale but not sell the other two-thirds, and that really all they are asking the Australian community <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="546"> is that they support one-third? If the logic they seek to apply to us equally applies to them, it casts a pretty severe question mark over those areas of current public ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It absolutely misses the point. If you believe that public ownership is immutable, as opposed to simply desirable where the circumstances justify it, the state governments would still own state fish shops, state butcher shops, state timber mills&mdash;all the sorts of things that they have owned during the course of this century and have subsequently discarded with no complaint, be they Labor governments or Liberal governments, as time has gone by. The point is that it ought to be in public ownership where it serves public purposes. If it ceases to serve public purposes or has become too difficult to sustain them, then out it goes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no justification for giving capital injections to airlines and banks when the services are being adequately provided elsewhere in an open and competitive environment. There was no sense in doing that at all, so we got out of it. Those operations, particularly airlines, require the capacity to be able to go into cross&hyphen;ownership arrangements if they are going to be decent global entities. That certainly applied to Qantas if it were to survive. So a sensible decision was taken by the government of the day. There is no sense in persisting with putting taxpayers' funds into that sort of operation when the majority of the community does not benefit from it and when competition survives anyway. So the Labor government made the decisions that it did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra is not in that position. Even though competition is there and the benefits and fruits of that competition are being delivered to our consumers now, it still enjoys massive market dominance. It still provides essential services around the country to a huge number of people. You can say anything you like about putting in place a set of community service obligations and whipping the flanks of the various telecommunications companies, including Telstra and private ownership, and alleging that that will do the trick for you. In fact, it will not.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The  pace  of  change  and  technological developments in communications is such that, whatever set of tasks you impose on them at any point in time, very rapidly the economics of it will take over. New technologies will come in. They will not be technologies that are obliged to a provision under community service obligations, and the equal treatment that the bush and regional Australia now enjoys with the cities will disappear like snow in spring and the real costs will start to come out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can go through these inflated back benches of the Liberal Party and National Party and point that out&mdash;point out that it costs $5,000 for connection fees if you are looking at the real cost of delivering a service, going up to $11,000 in some particular instances. That is fine if you can look at community service obligations in terms of what is now provided. But what does that mean? What does that indicate  for subsequent technological developments, most of which we have not even thought of to this point in time?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very interesting when you see the pay TV roll&hyphen;out going on at the moment. When are you going to see that particular known technology, which is not subject to any of these community service obligations, in the bush? When are you going to see it in Western Australia? When are you going to see that roll&hyphen;out in the northern parts of Queensland? You are not going to see it for a very substantial period of time. That is not a vital area of concern in telecommunications for the average Australian consumer, but it does indicate the realities of the economics of it. It does indicate what is going to happen to those community service obligations when Telstra is off the list of things that the government is obliged to nurture via its ownership of a fully publicly owned entity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we come to the question of public policy on the environment. I asked the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) a question yesterday which in a half&hyphen;smart way he got out of, but it is absolutely critical to the issue here on the environment. I asked him whether his propositions applied to the forward estimates as produced at the last budget or the forward <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="547"> estimates as adjusted for the Labor Party's election undertakings. He got up and said, `It applies to whatever'. That was basically the answer he gave.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What it means is this: if it applies to the forward estimates of the last budget&mdash;and if you look through the Liberal Party funding commitments in the last election campaign it appears obvious that that is the case&mdash;the value of that $1 billion to environmental spending in Australia is virtually nothing. All it does is sustain exactly what is there at the moment. Those forward estimates produce a change in the expenditure level over the next three years of something like $200 million down to $100 million and stays at $100 million for the foreseeable future, over the next five or six years. So when you put the $700 million on top of that over the next five years you effectively make minor upward adjustments to the program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In effect, that $1 billion is a slight enhancement of what was the ultimate adjustment to those forward estimates by us when we went into the election campaign ourselves. It is nothing new. It is not an amount of money that is going to make a damn bit of difference to the environmental spending of the government in any practical sense other than what we would have done ourselves if we had been re-elected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All those programs that have been mentioned in question time&mdash;every one of them&mdash;are initiatives of ours: the Murray-Darling, the cleaning up of the river systems, the coasts, the forests, the deserts. Every single one of them is a program developed by us and expended by us, not as some sort of con job for a privatisation entity but properly as an ordinary public provision. Every single one of those programs is at risk as a result of a deliberate decision. If that decision is taken by the parliament, then all that will flow is simply what would have been delivered by us if we had got into office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister asked me the question: what would you cut? What we are talking about here is $100 million, perhaps $120 million or $130 million, in a $130 billion budget. You get up there and talk about the needs of our river systems and the needs of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> our coasts, and you are not prepared to put up $130 million in a $130 billion budget. I turn the question back on him. Is it worth the last $100 million in our $5 billion worth of expenditure on education? Is it worth the last $100 million in our $18 billion worth of expenditure on health? Is it worth the last $100 million in our $34 billion worth of expenditure on social security? Those are the budget realities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This $1 billion con job is simply that&mdash;a con job. It is a means of trying to shift out of what is essential public expenditure when there are public expenditures of nowhere near that level of priority locked up in $130 billion worth of spending. It is an attempt to say that we will cobble all together what the previous government was doing; we will put all the programs in one pot; and we will cut forward outlays in environmental spending and substitute it with this process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we are not conned by it. We are not conned by the argument which goes to the fact that you think you can preserve community service obligations, when anyone who knows a darn bit about the changing technology in communications knows that that is impossible. We are not conned by any flowery words about the survival of our electronics industry, when we know that the British industry and the New Zealand industry&mdash;and certainly the British industry is a much stronger one than ours&mdash;can survive simply by chitchat. We are not conned when we know, because of our own experience, what obligations are on directors once it is partially out there in private ownership. We know exactly what those obligations are. We are not conned by that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we are going to oppose this in the national interest. We are opposing it in the interest of competition. We are opposing it in the interests of decent environmental policy, which any government, including yours, ought to consider including in their normal budget provision. We are opposing it in the interests of the Australian consumer. We are opposing it particularly in the interests of the Australian consumer who lives in the bush or regional Australia or in our smaller states, because we know from the example of what is happening <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="548"> with pay TV that you can write that large for future provision of telecommunications requirements in those areas. But, above all, we are opposing it in the interests of Australian industry and the Australian community. We are opposing it in the interests of decent privatisation policy. We are opposing it in the interests of our community. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is interesting to see that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) has seen fit to come into the House today in the middle of the speakers list to state the case for the opposition as far as the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill is concerned. There is one very clear difference between the coalition, the now government, and the Labor Party, the former government, on privatisation; that is, the coalition has always been prepared to be quite open and honest with the Australian people about what we want to do and what we want to see happen as far as the ownership of publicly owned assets in this nation is concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SU5">Mr VAILE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I acknowledge that. The thing is, Mr Deputy Speaker, you will recall <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> what happened last year when this House debated the sale of the last half of the Commonwealth Bank, when the Labor Party vowed and declared to the people of Australia on a stack of bibles that they would never sell it. The then Treasurer, the former finance minister, the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), signed off on the prospectus when they sold the first tranche of the Commonwealth Bank that the second half, over 50 per cent, of the Commonwealth Bank would remain in public ownership.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was only a matter of years and they were back in here, in the budget last year, announcing that they were going to sell the second half of the Commonwealth Bank. They did not even tell their own backbenchers. Because the coalition, in opposition at the time, supported the policy of privatising the Commonwealth Bank, they thought that the debate would roll through the parliament, that there would be no division and they could do it nicely and quietly and get away with it. That was the left&hyphen;wing members in particular. Remember all the left&hyphen;wing members in the Labor Party who were really annoyed when in the 37th Parliament the two Independents that were sitting here&mdash;that was the then member for Wills, Mr Cleary, and the then member for North Sydney, Mr Mack&mdash;called a division? The reason they called a division on the sale of the Commonwealth Bank was to throw the spotlight on the hypocrisy of the Labor Party and what they were doing in privatisation. They told the people in Australia that they would never sell the second half of the Commonwealth Bank. They said that they would not do it. They went back on their word.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the day when the debate concluded, I was in the chair. I thought that the bill would be passed on the voices and we would go on to the next piece of legislation before the House. The then member for Wills jumped up and called out no. I said, `Do the noes have it?' Both the then member for North Sydney and the then member for Wills opposed it and called a division. That was much to the chagrin of the Labor Party because all the left wing of the Labor Party&mdash;and their predecessors were turning in their graves&mdash;were under <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="549"> all sorts of pressure from left&hyphen;wing unions and left&hyphen;wing branches, and they were absolutely livid about having to come in here and support their then leader in the privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank. They all sat over there with us, all the opposition and the government of the day, and voted for the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. We had two Independents opposing it, and they were up there counting the vote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, we had photographers in that day. You will recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, that a few days later the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) asked questions of the Speaker as to whether the photographers were authorised to take photographs that afternoon. He wanted to know what the situation was and to get a ruling from the Speaker. He was not concerned about the procedures of the House and whether they had been authorised by the Speaker of the day. What he was concerned about was being photographed voting to sell the Commonwealth Bank. That is the hypocrisy of the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the Leader of the Opposition comes in here today and says, `We're going to vote against this. We're going to oppose it. We're going to do all sorts of things.' They expected and got the coalition's support on the sale of the Commonwealth Bank, because we clearly set out to the people of Australia in the years we were in opposition that that was part of our policy. Coming up to the 2 March federal election this year, we clearly set out to the people of Australia what our policy was with regard to privatisation and the sale of one-third of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have been perfectly frank with the people of Australia on what we are going to sell; how much foreign ownership will be allowed; what we are going to keep; where the money is going to go to; and the process that will take place. Here, in the second sitting week of the 38th Parliament&mdash;after we won the election with an enormous mandate based on the policies we put forward with regard to the privatisation of Telstra&mdash;we are debating the bill that we said we would put into place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who are the Australian people going to believe? Before 2 March they certainly did <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not believe the then Prime Minister when he stood at public meetings around Australia with his hand on his heart and said, `We will never sell Telstra.' The people in my electorate who used to be Labor supporters said, `Yes, we remember when he said, "We will never sell the Commonwealth Bank. We will never sell Australian Airlines. We will never sell Qantas. We will never sell the Federal Airports Corporation."'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people of Australia will not buy the argument that the Leader of the Opposition is putting: there is a difference between this type of privatisation and that type of privatisation. It is utter nonsense. He knows that very well. The Labor Party are absolutely without credibility on this public policy issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the Opposition is trying to cast aspersions on this bill and the way we propose to proceed with the sale of one-third of Telstra by comparing the situation with the sales of British Telecom and Telecom in New Zealand. He knows that they were done differently. They were put on the open market and sold completely. The opposition knows very well that no regulatory controls were put over and above those publicly owned monopolies before they were sold. The Leader of the Opposition knows very well why there are problems in those areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many members of the Labor Party have been involved in Public Accounts Committee inquiries and have been overseas to look at communications systems, and they know exactly what the pitfalls are. So does the government of today. That is why there will be sound regulations implemented with regard to the protection of community service obligations, and that is why the concerns that the Leader of the Opposition has just raised in his address to the House a while ago will be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition leader spoke about the imperatives for public ownership. I ask&mdash;and the people of Australia should ask themselves this question&mdash;what the imperatives of the Labor Party were so far as public and private ownership of public monopolies were concerned in the last parliament. What were the Labor Party's imperatives when they sold the second half of the Commonwealth Bank after <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="550"> they had promised on a stack of bibles that they would not do so? The then finance minister signed a public document, which anybody in the private sector would sign under normal Corporations Law. It said that they would not sell any more of the Commonwealth Bank, that it would remain in public ownership. They went back on their word. The signature of the member for Gellibrand was on that document when it was floated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people of Australia know that the Labor Party is without credibility on this issue. They know what the imperatives of the Labor Party were. The 1995-96 budget, brought down in August, purported to have a $700 million surplus. But it was all based on assets sales. They were factoring assets sales into the budget. Every single economic commentator around Australia said that you cannot do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did the Labor Party do with the proceeds of assets sales? They spent it on recurrent funding programs and all the government programs. They did not do the responsible thing and use any part of those assets sales, which they oversaw while they were in government, to reduce Commonwealth debt. They did  not even attempt to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that the Leader of the Opposition is asking what our imperatives for the privatisation of public assets are. We ask what the Labor Party's imperatives were on the assets sale program that they oversaw in the years that they were in government. There were pages and pages of them. I have mentioned only a few. There were pages of all the different things that they had flogged off. But they never ever applied one cent of that money to retiring public debt and reducing the interest that the taxpayers of Australia pay on that public debt every month when the balance of payments deficit figure comes in. The most recent figure was $1.5 billion. An element of that is Commonwealth interest that we are paying to service that debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the Opposition has, in the middle of this debate, put the opposition's case that they are going to oppose this bill. They are trying to resurrect this debate from where it is today on behalf of the Labor <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Party. They are trying to get the Labor Party back into this debate. But, in the public arena, it is an impossible task for them. They cannot do it. They have been discredited, and they cannot do it on the argument of privatisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The one great furphy, the one great thorn in their sides, is the dead cat that the member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton) will drag around his ankle for the rest of his political career&mdash;ANL. How many times did the opposition try to address that? How many times did they try to sell it? The former minister said publicly that they could not give it away. Yet the former government kept on pouring taxpayers' money into it. If anything should have been got rid of, it should have been ANL.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are losing money. The former government has lost hundreds of millions of dollars of money through ANL. They were not allowed to get rid of ANL. The question should be put to the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson): why were they not allowed to get rid of it? Why are the taxpayers of Australia subsidising the PAYE tax of seafarers who belong to the Maritime Union of Australia? That is a another debate, but it links into the privatisation debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do not let the people of Australia lose sight of what the Labor Party did over the last three years in this area of public policy. Labor members will have the ANL dead cat drag around them for the rest of their political careers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer to what the government is proposing to do through the Telstra bill. It proposes to sell one-third of the Commonwealth's equity, which will be made available through a share float and of which 65 per cent will be reserved for Australian investors as A class shares. So only one-third of the value of Telstra is to be sold and 65 per cent of that one-third is to remain in Australian ownership. The bill states the intentions of the government for the sale of Telstra. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bills Digest</EMPHASIS> reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Foreign investors only to be allowed to subscribe to thirty five per cent of the float and to be issued with B class shares.

<PARA>I will stop there. Mr Deputy Speaker, during the federal election campaign, you would have been treated&mdash;just as I was&mdash;to the outrageous garbage that was printed by the Labor Party and allowed to be distributed throughout Australian electorates. The people who were in government in this country for 13 years showed an absolute disregard for the laws of this land. They were running around putting stickers opposing the sale of Telstra, which they knew were illegal, on telephone boxes. In my electorate the federal police investigated the Labor candidate in his campaign office for distributing fake $20 bills. That was a hangover from the 1993 election. Who printed and authorised the bills? Who printed and authorised the stickers that were on all the phone boxes in my electorate? The union movement. The union movement underwrote the Labor Party's election campaigns in 1993 and in 1996. It was an absolutely despicable way of campaigning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As you would well know, Mr Deputy Speaker, the worst element of the Telstra debate throughout the 1996 election campaign was the way the Labor Party showed absolutely no concern for the feelings of elderly citizens in the community by sending out fake Telstra telephone accounts. Those fake accounts went to constituents of mine and I will guarantee that they went to constituents in every electorate in Australia. It was an absolute disgrace. The Leader of the Opposition should take responsibility for that as the leader of the Labor Party in Australia. It happened in every electorate in Australia. I <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> had an unbelievable number of telephone calls from concerned people saying, `I paid my telephone bill last week. Why am I getting another bill from Telstra? You're my federal member. Can you find out about it?' They were the tactics used by the Labor Party. That is the depth that the Labor Party have reached in public debate in Australia today. It emanated from the Prime Minister of the day. We can only trust that things might improve from here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We ran the privatisation debate on a perfectly public and honest level. We announced it well in advance of 2 March when the people had to go to the polling booth. They knew exactly what was going to happen to Telstra if they installed a coalition government. But the Labor Party were desperate because their public policy on this issue had absolutely no credibility. They are still desperate today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the Leader of the Opposition comes into this House and tells the people of Australia that the Labor Party are going to vote against this bill, it only reinforces what the people of Australia know: the Labor Party cannot be believed. They could not believe the Labor Party with the part sale of the Commonwealth Bank when it was floated. They could not believe them with the sale of Qantas, the Federal Airports Corporation, and ANL and they can't believe them now. The Labor Party are going to come in here and be obstructionist and vote against this. They are going to whip the Leader of the Democrats, Senator Kernot, into a frenzy. It just will not wash with the people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a number of media commentaries about the stand the Democrats have taken against the sale of Telstra. They have taken that stand on the false premise that, because they have seven seats in the Senate, the people of Australia want them to oppose the government legislation. That is absolutely ludicrous. I have newspaper articles here with the headlines `NFF slams Kernot's stand on Telstra' and `Kernot and Chipp differ over the sale of Telstra'. Don Chipp is the founder of the Democrats&mdash;the reason they exist today. An editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> is headlined `Democrats wrong on Telstra sale'. The <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="552"> Democrats should read this. They should get out in the community and try to gauge the public feeling about this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The public want to see more competition in the telecommunications field. We are going to progress that much further. The public want to see government monopolies operating properly in the commercial field. It would be interesting for the opposition to note what the situation is. They know very well the management and accountancy practices of all government agencies. Under the Labor administration Commonwealth agencies did not even attempt to introduce any form of accrual accounting into their management practices. Through partial privatisation, Telstra will become a far more responsible, competitive and efficient corporate citizen in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before my time expires I want to highlight a couple of very important points. Another Labor lie that was trotted around during the election campaign was about the cost of telephone services to people in rural and regional Australia. It was another furphy. Under this legislation we are guaranteeing the community service obligations. The National Party gets slated for joining the Liberal Party in going down the line of privatising one-third of Telstra. The people of Australia, particularly those in rural and regional Australia, have no need to worry about the backbone of National Party members with regard to the CSOs and the provision of services. We are going to guarantee those. The government has reaffirmed in the bill its commitment to the key consumer safeguard&mdash;the universal provision of service. All Australians will continue to have reasonable access on an equitable basis to the standard telephone and payphone services. The universal service obligations will continue to be funded by the carriers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At this point it is worth correcting Senator Kernot, who has said that the USO provisions are a substantially watered down version of those in the current act. That is rubbish, just as the propaganda put out by the Labor Party during the election campaign was rubbish. The USOs remain. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition is firmly of the view that no part <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of Telstra should be sold. We are committed to a 100 per cent government owned carrier for this nation. We believe that selling all or part of Telstra represents an act of gross irresponsibility. The opposition will not be supporting the sale of Telstra on the basis that it will be a more competitive company once it has been sold, as the government claims. Nor will the opposition support the government's scurrilous suggestions on talkback radio that mums and dads will be able to own a greater share of Telstra, having participated in its privatisation.               </PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, Australians have been able to purchase a share of Telstra over the years by virtue of the fact that they have paid their telephone bills. To link the passage of this bill, which will see the beginning of the total privatisation of one of the Australian public's most lucrative and strategically important assets, to foreign owners with the establishment of a capital trust to fund environmental programs is perhaps one of the lowest examples of political expediency that this House has ever seen. By comparison, Labor's approach to the environment came with no qualification. We believe that the environment should be funded in an ongoing manner simply in the same way that other key areas such as health and education are funded. Labor has had a long and abiding commitment to landcare, coast care and the restoration of the Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin&mdash;long before the environment ever became a contemporary issue in the minds of the government. This has also been done without any reference whatsoever to blackmail of the kind perpetrated by this government on the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra is a strong and vibrant company. It is vigorously and successfully seeking new markets in Asia and across the world. Its value has increased from $18 billion at the time when John Hewson attempted to sell it to around $24 billion today. These figures, and the fact that it has made a half&hyphen;yearly 1995-96 profit of $1.853 billion, certainly put paid to any government claims that Telstra cannot be managed efficiently if it remains within the public sector. Let us not kid ourselves for a moment that the short-sighted and ideologically driven legislation that is before <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="553"> the chamber today, aimed at selling one-third of Telstra, will inevitably lead to the sale of the whole of Telstra, as Senator Alston's speech on 30 April of this year has made quite clear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that the government will try to cloud the waters in this debate by making a spurious claim, as it has already this morning on several occasions, that the Labor government's approach to the sale of Telstra is no different to the sale of the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas. This attempt to muddy these waters is grossly misleading, and I wish to take some time to set out some of the reasons why.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra provides nearly 90 per cent of this nation's telecommunications services. As such, it has inherent natural monopoly characteristics. It is Australia's largest government owned asset and part of Australia's social infrastructure. Neither Qantas nor the Commonwealth Bank could lay claim to such positions. Nor could they lay claim to the market dominance that Telstra currently enjoys. Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank do not impact upon genuine issues of national interest. The Commonwealth Bank serviced only about 20 per cent of the banking sector of Australia. Many of its functions, which at that time set the standards for conduct of banks in this nation, have long since been passed and allocated to the Reserve Bank.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, Qantas enjoys only about 50 per cent of the domestic air travel business and less than 40 per cent of the international travel market in and out of Australia. Obviously, only a small proportion of Australians fly on a regular basis. I should point out that both the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas regularly require capital injections of federal funds from time to time to expand their businesses. Telstra raises all its own investment funds without a drain on the federal Treasury for capital expenditure. Unlike Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank, Telstra provides an established world&hyphen;class telecommunications network to all Australians at reasonable cost. Telstra has already been corporatised and is performing very well in international markets.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra, that great Australian corporation, as I have alluded to, posted a post&hyphen;tax profit of $1.753 billion in its 1994-95 financial year. This leads me to suggest that Telstra's total value added represents 2.2 per cent of GDP. Of course, Telstra pays substantial income tax. Last year $649 million was paid to the federal government. Telstra, as a public corporation, does not seek to minimise its tax payments, yet once privatised there is no doubt that Telstra will minimise its tax payments significantly. Not only will Telstra's community service obligations be diminished, but it will minimise its tax payments to the government, resulting in even further cuts to government services to all Australians who, through the payment of their phone bills over the years, now effectively own a share of Telstra in their own right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra paid a dividend of $944 million to the federal government last year. In the event that one-third of Telstra is privatised, one-third of this dividend will be lost. It goes without saying that, in the likely event that all of Telstra is privatised, all of this income would be lost as revenue. In its current form Telstra's returns to government will continue to grow and expand. That proportion of privatised Telstra's dividend which will go overseas will be added to our own current account deficit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have emphasised, Telstra is 100 per cent Australian owned. The parliament, and through it the Minister for  Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston), is responsible for all service deliveries and is responsible if service is not adequately delivered to the Australian communication consumer. Service is being delivered. As the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) said in this place last night, Telstra is perhaps the greatest communications carrier in the world today. If one-third of this great communications carrier is floated, despite having two-thirds of the shares, the minister, and therefore the parliament, will not be able to intervene in the running of the corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="554"> The bill before the parliament repeals the power of the minister to direct the board in the national interest. This means that a company which is 70 per cent owned by Austral ians will act according to the views of all directors, including foreign directors. This will undermine the undertakings in the bill to protect Australian consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister can investigate or conduct inquiries into the performance of a privatised Telstra but can she or he act on information revealed? The answer is absolutely no. Furthermore, the minister cannot vary the Telstra corporate plan prepared by the board. What is more, there will be no separate shares for foreigners as promised during the election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition wrote this promise to control levels of foreign ownership of Telstra by issuing A class shares to Australian nationals and B class shares to foreigners. Scrapping this commitment will no doubt make it easier for foreigners to acquire shares beyond the existing 11 per cent limit. I want to know, in particular, what has happened to that promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The role of Telstra's board of directors will be to maximise profits and, therefore, returns to shareholders. This will be done fundamentally by increasing the cost of installation and calls, by decreasing levels of employment and by decreasing community service obligations. The dramatic cost increases predicted from the sale of Telstra will hit the cost of the average telephone user squarely in the neck. The telecommunications industry and all those ancillary companies that depend so heavily on Telstra for their very existence will also be hit squarely in the neck.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over 70 per cent of Telstra's equipment, materials and services purchases are from Australian firms, big and small. A privatised</PARA>
<PARA>Telstra would not be required to maintain the purchasing policies that the former government put in place when OTC was combined with Telecom&mdash;as it was then&mdash;several years ago to form Telstra. The size and economies of scale generated by Telstra provide a hub around which a multitude of ancillary industries that make up a diverse range of the communications network industry revolve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only does the existing employment level of Telstra generate demand within the economy but so does the corporation itself. I repeat that a privatised Telstra with greatly <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> depleted employment levels would not be required to sustain existing Australian oriented purchasing policies of the kind that exist with our national carrier of communications today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt, as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) put so succinctly in his speech to this place a moment ago, that this would herald the end of the Australian electronics industry. Instead, under foreign direction, Telstra will look to more convenient ways of making profits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill does not prevent a privatised Telstra from charging for directory assistance. This would increase revenue by $80 million per annum at the expense, in particular, of the sight and hearing impaired and, to a lesser degree, mobile phone users. Similarly, the impost of a charge for directory services would have an impact on the elderly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra remains a major exporter of telecommunications equipment and services. The increase in exports from approximately $50 million in 1983 to nearly $1 billion today has had significant positive benefits and impacts upon our foreign debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Asian telecommunications market is the biggest potential market in the world. When foreign telecommunications companies take a share in Telstra they will not be enthusiastic about Telstra competing with their own companies overseas in those international markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now to the crucial issue of community service obligations. Telstra is required to provide a universal service to all Australians and to ensure equity for all Australians. We do not want to develop a structure of information rich and information poor Australians. Universal service obligations are basically defined in the Telecommunications Act 1991 wherein they are outlined as being to ensure that the standard telephone service is reasonably accessible to all people in Australia on an equitable basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="555"> It is the responsibility of Telstra to meet these community service obligations. Under the previous government this was done admirably because the previous government had acknowledged that social policy consider ations, as well as questions of market power, lay behind the application of price controls over Telstra. These controls are necessary to ensure that prices remain affordable in the loss making universal service areas, particularly those areas in the bush.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra's universal service obligations will be of no interest whatsoever to a profit&hyphen;driven board of directors. The watering down of these universal service obligations will, as I have alluded to, be bad for rural and regional Australia because these USOs underpin subsidies to those areas. Will a foreign, profit&hyphen;driven owner regard such subsidies as being economically feasible or viable? I think not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All those opposite with electorates in rural and regional Australia ought to hang on to their Akubras because, on the basis of subsidy withdrawal, they might find themselves out of a job come the next election. It is of some bewilderment to me that the seat of Farrer, which is occupied by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer), received $5.8 million in subsidies last year and the seat of Gwydir, which is occupied by his colleague, the Deputy Leader of the National Party (Mr Anderson), received $13.5 million in subsidies last year. That these two gentlemen and others of their ilk would vote against this amendment is absurd in the extreme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my own electorate of Isaacs, we have the rapidly growing outlying suburb of Cranbourne on the south&hyphen;eastern fringe of Melbourne. Cranbourne lies within the 059 STD area code, and on behalf of its people I will be doing all that I can to ensure that it is drawn within the 03 Melbourne area code as soon as possible. However, my task will no doubt be made much more difficult by the fact that directors of the new foreign owned Telstra will pay no heed to the needs of people on the outlying fringes of such metropolitan cities who wish to be incorporated within the 03 and other metropolitan area codes for obvious reasons of cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, this bill constitutes nothing more than privatisation for privatisation's sake. In a January AGB McNair poll, 61 per cent of the people stated that they were opposed to the sale of Telstra in any form. We should not let outsiders profit from the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sale of Telstra, one of the world's finest communication carriers, simply because the government maintains a dogged adherence to a failed political ideology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We ought not to forget that Telstra does not need capital injections; it makes a profit and is viable in its own right. It drives the Australian electronics industry, which depends on Telstra's domestic purchases for its very existence. In 1983, as I have already stated, our electronics industry exported $50 million worth of goods per annum and that same domestic electronics industry now exports some $1 billion worth of goods per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If privatised, there is one thing you will not be able to do with Telstra&mdash;that is, maintain a quality of subsidised service if you do not own it. That ought to be borne critically in the minds of those opposite, particularly in the minds of those who occupy the many rural and marginal seats which were gained by the government at the last election, which, as I say, they may not hold come the next election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In commending the amendment to the House, I suggest that all members examine critically the experiences of those in New Zealand and Britain where profits have risen, the number of jobs has fallen and dividends paid to shareholders have gone through the roof. That is not the sort of Telstra we want to see in Australia. We do not want to see Telstra privatised simply for the sake of some outdated, incorrect political ideology. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

We do not particularly like city slickers talking about rural and regional matters, especially when they know absolutely nothing about them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That's all right. The Labor Party and the Leader of the Opposition have got themselves into extraordinary trouble with this bill. They were the great privatisers of the 1980s and 1990s and, all of a sudden, when they get across to the other side of the chamber&mdash;where they will be for a long time, as I am sure the honourable member for Eden&hyphen;Monaro (Mr Nairn) would agree&mdash;they start playing petty politics. I can tell you now that the Australian people will not fall for petty politics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it quite extraordinary that the new member for Isaacs, who was sworn in a week and a half ago, seems to have forgotten that one of the key elements of the coalition's approach to the Australian people&mdash;when we received a resounding victory, one of the greatest victories in this country's political history&mdash;was the partial sale of Telstra to provide some desperately needed funds for the environment. The Australian people voted with their feet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that the Leader of the Opposition finds it attractive to play party politics, but he is going down the wrong track. His little doozey during his speech this morning when he suddenly said, `We were going to do it in the forward estimates anyway,' I can assure you would not fool even the most gullible. I am not surprised that his preferred Prime Minister rating is languishing only at 25 per cent. It can only head south rather than north if he keeps up this sort of carry&hyphen;on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will enable the government to deliver on its election promises and be up&hyphen;front with the Australian people about its privatisation plans. The House should be in no doubt that the benefits of this bill will be counted by many future generations. It should not be jeopardised by outdated ideological beliefs or petty politics. A fast, efficient and affordable communications system is necessary for our economic and social development. With systems like the Internet and e&hyphen;mail becoming an integral part of our daily lives, it is important that Australia has a first&hyphen;class system to keep abreast of these changes. We all know how vital an efficient communications system is, be it for something as simple as ordering our takeaway at night or <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for something as complex as delivering medical services across the country. Without an effective communications system this country will be adrift.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be fair to say that Australian users of telecommunications services have been left out. They do not have the services they should, prices are too high, productivity is too low, and there is an urgent need to improve service quality. A new approach is needed, and it is being delivered by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principal purpose of this bill is to facilitate the sale of up to one&hyphen;third of the Commonwealth's equity in Telstra. At the same time this bill will impose strict aggregate and individual foreign ownership limits to ensure that Telstra is and remains Australian owned and controlled. It was a very clear part of our election platform that Telstra should remain Australian owned and controlled, and indeed that is the very base upon which the Australian people voted on this matter. As a sign of the government's genuine commitment to ensure that consumers are protected under the partial privatisation of Telstra, this bill will require general communications carriers to provide the option of untimed local calls to all&mdash;and I underline `all'&mdash;customers in local call areas, as well as introducing a new customer service guarantee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From this partial privatisation, a Natural Heritage Trust will be established to protect and rehabilitate Australia's natural heritage. Telstra's partial privatisation will go to retire debt and will not fund recurrent expenditure as the Labor Party did. Every piece of privatisation it brought through in its 13 years was to fund recurrent expenditure. To partially privatise Telstra is to make the company even more responsive to market signals and to allow it to better compete on the domestic and international stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members should also note that this bill contains a single provision which will enable the sale of only one&hyphen;third of the Commonwealth's equity in Telstra. The bill does not allow the Commonwealth's equity to fall below two&hyphen;thirds, reflecting the government's undertaking at the last election. It is important to note that the sale proceeds will provide special incentives for individual Australians <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="558"> and Telstra employees to invest in their company. As part of the sale process, the government will examine appropriate mechanisms to enable the allocation of Telstra shares to a wide spread of Australian investors, including institutional investors and members of the Australian community. In many cases these will be the mums and dads of our community investing in a piece of our country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A $1 billion commitment to Australia's environment will be one of the results of Telstra's partial privatisation. The benefits to the Australian community of these measures will be enormous. We will at last be able to tackle the problem of land and water degradation and we will have for the first time in Australia's history a national appraisal of the extent of our land and water degradation. We will have a national river care initiative which will assist local communities in the restoration of their rivers and waterways. We will be able to tackle the environmental problems facing our coasts and oceans. We will have additional funding to assist in the management and upkeep of Australia's world heritage areas. We will be able to introduce a range of measures to address the problem of air pollution in major cities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is in these ways that the Australian people will be the benefactors of the Telstra partial privatisation. It will be all Australian people&mdash;those in rural, regional and city areas&mdash;who will benefit from these measures. Never before has a government stood on the threshold of delivering such a comprehensive environmental package to our nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the essential nature of the environmental programs which will result from the passing of this bill, it is a pity that this bill could not have received bipartisan support. Had those opposite been serious and genuine in their commitment to government controlled assets then perhaps we would have taken notice of their arguments. But they are neither serious nor genuine. Labor is about as genuine in their opposition to the partial privatisation of Telstra as they were in their opposition to the privatisation of Qantas, the FAC and&mdash;who could forget&mdash;the Commonwealth Bank.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Had Labor been in government, the `For sale' sign would have gone up on Telstra just as quickly as it did on these assets. Indeed, during the campaign it became very clear that the Labor Party was actually in the process of selling off chunks of Telstra. Even Graham Richardson made it clear that, rather than sell only one&hyphen;third of Telstra as the present government is about to do, former Prime Minister Keating wanted to sell the whole lot. Have no doubt: if Keating had had his way and his proposal had gone to caucus those who are now debating Telstra's partial privatisation would have put their hands up to sell off the lot. The ALP are not interested in what is best for Australia; they are only interested in being vindictive and in nursing their own bruised egos.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The best the ALP can offer this debate is the suggestion that funding for certain environmental programs should come from elsewhere, but where? As the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said the other day, do they want to cut pensions, funding to schools, funding to health? Where is the money going to come from? I notice that the Left is now advocating a GST, a consumption tax. Is this where the Labor Party want the money to come from? Maybe they advocate an environment levy. Or perhaps they want to fund the environment by adding to debt. Not content with the $8 billion deficit legacy to the nation, they apparently want a further mortgage on our children and grandchildren.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I listen to this debate I ask myself: why do the ALP really oppose this bill? We have already established that it is not because they are against privatisation. In fact, they are advocates of such policies. Maybe the ALP are just opposed to increased spending on the environment. Perhaps they are opposed to cleaner water. Perhaps they are opposed to protection for endangered species. Perhaps they are opposed to fixing up the Murray-Darling Basin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps the ALP are opposed to workers benefiting from Telstra's partial privatisation. As we all know, for every three shares of Telstra purchased by employees, they will receive an extra one free. These workers are the average mums and dads of Australia, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="559"> young men and women trying hard to make a living. But the ALP want to deny them a chance for a bit more financial security. Is it any wonder that it is these people who walked away from the Labor Party in droves? Is it any wonder that the ALP no longer represent workers? They certainly do not represent Telstra workers. Clearly, nobody can really know why the ALP are opposing this bill. I suspect that they really do not know themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the last election campaign there was a lot of misinformation put out by those opposite. I know because a lot of it was in my electorate. There were claims that the government's plan would lead to timed local calls. Wrong. As we can see from this bill, that is not the case. There were accusations that Telstra would not remain Australian owned. Again, as we can see from the bill, that is wrong. Those opposite should note that this bill amends the Telstra Corporation Act to ensure that Telstra's head office, base of operations and incorporation remain in Australia and that its chairman and the majority of its directors are Australian citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those opposite claim that consumers would be the losers from this initiative but, again, this legislation makes a mockery of that claim. On the contrary, this bill proposes a new scheme for customer service guarantee, which we hope will actually lead to an increase in customer service, rather than a withdrawal. This bill will set performance standards for carriers in relation to arrangements about the period taken for connection of telecommunications services, for rectifying faults and service difficulties and for keeping appointments with customers. Those carriers who fail to comply with performance standards will have penalties imposed upon them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Surely this legislation sets the scene for what will prove to be an effective and efficient delivery of services to customers. Those opposite should also note that this bill reaffirms the government's commitment to the key consumer safeguard: the provision of universal service. Under the government, all Australians will continue to have regional access on an equitable basis to the standard telephone service and payphone service.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a democracy, people are entitled to receive what they vote for. On 2 March the Australian people voted for this bill, and they voted very clearly. This point should not be lost on the opposition or the Australian Democrats. The Democrats know that they have a moral duty to vote with the government on this bill for it is the want of the overwhelming majority of Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When talking about the importance of an effective communications system, we should ensure that it is a system for all Australians, not just those in the city regions. I would like to add to some of the points raised by my colleague the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), who spoke recently. He spoke about the lack of services for country people. I can assure him that he is not alone in his concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had many constituents over previous years complain to me about the lack of service they have access to. I talk about basic items that those in metropolitan areas take for granted&mdash;itemised phone bills and mobile phone facilities. Some people cannot even get analog, let alone digital. Another example relates to community information services, such as the poisons line. There are country families living on farms who cannot even access basic information such as the poisons line. If we achieve only one thing out of this Telstra privatisation&mdash;I suspect that we are going to achieve a hell of a lot more&mdash;then if we can start delivering a bit of equity to country and regional people from this bill we will have served a very great purpose, in my view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation has the potential to deliver to Australia a first-class environment and a world&hyphen;class communications system. If we are to show off our nation at the Olympics in the year 2000 as a green nation, then we desperately need to set up the Natural Heritage Trust, and this legislation will make that possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the minutes remaining to me, I want to tell those opposite&mdash;I am very pleased that there are very few of them now representing rural and regional electorates&mdash;that their gross ignorance of the problems this country faces is a very sad reflection upon all of them. They really do not understand the waterways <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="560"> network in this country and the very grave risk this country faces if we do not do something about water quality. They should go out, find out something about it and come back into this House and apologise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is about finally addressing some of the environmental issues, such as the proliferation and rapid spread of blue-green algae through the waterways in my own state of Victoria and the severe degradation of water quality and the problems we are getting upstream and downstream. The member for Eden-Monaro knows exactly what I am talking about. This is water quality from upstream and downstream. We do not have time to procrastinate in this House about selling off one-third of Telstra to pay for desperately needed environmental measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sick and tired of the Democrats, in the other house, talking about their environmental bone fides and their green credentials. They have none as a result of their stand on this Telstra privatisation bill. For the leader of the Democrats to march around this country and say that she has got carte blanche to oppose it is absolute rubbish. Part of this government's commitment to the Australian people with the partial privatisation of Telstra was that we were going to put $1 billion into the environment. The Australian people know full well that it is desperately needed. They know that we have to start addressing land degradation problems. They know that we have to start addressing water quality problems. Those from the city have spent more time going on Sunday drives in the bush and they can see it for themselves. They can see the salt patches on the side of the road. They have friends who live in the country who tell them about the water quality problem. They know clearly that we have but one chance to address these problems and I do not want to see the Labor Party blow it. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill raises a number of very important issues, including those raised by the previous speaker, the member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson). I hope to cast a very different light on the government's proposal. First of all, it is important to say that we on this side <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> believe there are arguments for privatisation of publicly owned assets from time to time, but the situation must be very carefully assessed before the judgment is made to move from full public ownership to either part or full private ownership.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is often necessary&mdash;if you look at the history of this country, it has been&mdash;for the public sector to provide goods and services when either the risk level, the size or duration of the investment and likely returns means that the private sector is not interested. In the history of his country, governments at various times have owned breweries, brickworks, and so on, which we no longer own. Transferring assets to the private sector may later be justified by the public being able to fund new areas of service or development and where there is appropriate provision in the private sector, as has occurred with the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas sales. But the sale of Telstra is clearly not in that category.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that there is a very firm commitment by the Australian people, and by at least this side of the parliament, to the need for public ownership and control of what are general utilities and essential services. Certainly, Telstra fits into this category. The telephone and associated telecommunications are not something to be used by a small proportion of the community. They are not discretionary; they are essential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposal to sell part of Telstra&mdash;from the words of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) during the election campaign, ultimately all of it&mdash;is clearly driven by ideology. It is the same sort of ideological push that we have seen in state governments of a Liberal conservative cast which are selling off water and electricity supplies&mdash;natural public monopolies which should not be in private ownership. Telstra has the same characteristic. The privatisation of these public monopolies to private monopolies sees a return to something that we saw a century or two ago in some of these areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="561"> Sadly, these lessons have not been learned. The political and social dangers attaching to private monopolies appears not to have been understood by the new government. The basic needs of the community&mdash;clean water, electri city, telecommunications&mdash;should not be entrusted to the very linear, limited and short&hyphen;term needs of private investors. That is why we have a public sector, something the government is clearly opposed to. It thinks no government is good government, in which case we could probably get rid of this parliament altogether.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sale of an asset like Telstra would also encourage private investors to lock up capital in utilities and well-established sectors which are very stable. The money is then no longer available for investment in high risk areas and for creating growth. You are not improving the performance of the Australian business sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra, as we all know, is a natural monopoly&mdash;although there are some elements of competition, courtesy of the previous Labor government&mdash;but it also represents a huge investment for the entire Australian community. Successive generations of taxpayers and users have owned Telstra. It is available to all, regardless of where they live. Certainly, there are differences in some of the services provided in remote and regional Australia. We are all aware of that and we sought to improve things in government. The sale of Telstra, be it a third of a whole, will not make the situation any better. Indeed, there is nothing in the legislation which would protect country users from big increases in costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my view, if you held a referendum tomorrow the Australian community would vote overwhelmingly against either a part or full sale of Telstra. That is why the position of the Australian Democrats is vindicated. Like us, the Democrats and the Greens clearly went to the electorate saying, `We will oppose the sale of Telstra.' They saw the link to the environment as bogus. We are all entitled to say to the people who voted for us, `We will do what we said we would do during the election campaign and vote against the sale of Telstra.' It is very clear that the Australian community will not contemplate supporting that sale. If the government were sure of its ground it could call a referendum on this question. I am sure it will not because it knows the result would be a resounding no.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the moment Telstra provides an essential service at an affordable cost to all Australians regardless of locale, something I certainly appreciate, having been brought up in the country. I know the effects on country people of the expenses attached to the differentials that start to creep in. It is also important to recognise that there is nothing in the legislation to guarantee that a privatised Telstra would continue the cross&hyphen;subsidies that enable country people to afford to use a telephone. You have only to look at the behaviour of the states which have privatised things like electricity supplies or which are in the process of doing it to see what would happen to costs in country areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ask the people of country Victoria what will happen to the cost of their electricity in years to come. At the moment there is a bit of a barrier; there will be a short&hyphen;term sop. But in the long term, as they have been told by the current Premier, they will see an increase in the cost of electricity supplies. No doubt the same thing will happen in South Australia with a privatised water supply. Private enterprise will not cross&hyphen;subsidise. It has shown that very clearly in the provision of other services, so why would it do it in the case of telecommunications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also important to recognise&mdash;especially if we are talking about funding various policies, be it the environment, health or aged care&mdash;that Telstra now provides a very substantial revenue stream to government. Estimates that I have seen in this area and others show that the losses to government over time are greater than the short&hyphen;term boost from the asset sale and the remaining revenue stream through taxes and so on, which are, in any case, likely to be minimised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is nothing surer than that, with a privatised Telstra, whether partly or wholly, the board will be directing the company not only to make investments in overseas telecommunication industries but also to make sure that tax is paid at the minimum possible level. The minister cannot direct any of those things. That is not possible under the current legislation. So the government would be left with less revenue from Telstra through the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="562"> combination of the sale and tax arrangements. That is very short&hyphen;sighted indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now turn to what, from my point of view as shadow minister for the environment, is a very important problem with the legislation&mdash;that is, the attempt to link it to a decent environment policy. I note with some interest the title of the bill: dilution of public ownership. What it really is is a dilution of good public policy, particularly in the area of the environment. The second reading speech of the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith) referred, as some members here have, to the $1 billion from the sale of Telstra which will be devoted to a range of environmental initiatives. I have to say that in my time in parliament, which now amounts to 10 years, I have never seen a government deliberately hypothecate revenue in this way. The member sitting opposite me, the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey), the former Premier of New South Wales, will know how much resistance treasuries usually give to this sort of arrangement. It is without precedent in that sense. The scale of it is extraordinary. The link between the sale of Telstra and the environment represents a very backward step indeed, both for environment policy as well as financial policy and fiscal management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the election campaign a lot was said by John Howard about how he had become a greenie. He went out with his top button unfastened and his leisure gear on to woo the environment. He said that environmental matters were now considered `mainstream issues'. At the launch of the coalition's Telstra environment policy in the Dandenong Ranges National Park on 31 January, John Howard said, and I think it is important to put it on the record again:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Concern about the environment is no longer some kind of fetish, pseudo&hyphen;intellectual passing phase issue, it is now a mainstream issue of permanent concern to Australians of all generations and that is a point that I have made time and time again, not only in the period I have been Leader of the Opposition, but also before that, and therefore what we have decided to do in this policy is to make the biggest&hyphen;ever commitment of the Coalition Parties across the board to tackle environment issues. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>Those are noble and commendable words in and of themselves, but they are not actually reflected in the coalition's environment policy. It is a policy that will never be implemented because it can never be funded. The reason it will never be funded has got nothing to do with the Labor Party, the Australian Democrats or the Greens in the Senate. After all, those senators did not write the policy. They did not make the unprincipled connection between the sale of a public asset and the development of an environment policy. They did not make that promise at all. We all spelt out very clearly our opposition to the sale of Telstra long before that link was ever made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before John Howard in the election campaign made the link he knew that all the other major parties were lined up against the sale of Telstra. That is why he linked the environment policy to it. He thought he could do something that he wanted to do for ideological and budget reasons, to fund their other promises&mdash;and that was to sell Telstra, or part of it. He thought, `Ah, I've got these people. They want a good environment policy so I'll link the two.' He knew well in advance of that announcement that all the bodies I mentioned were opposed to it. The coalition's environment policy will never be funded because it should never have been promised in the first place. It was totally unprincipled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John Howard likes to make holier than thou statements about politicians keeping their promises and has been doing it for a long time. Yet he seems to have forgotten the most fundamental rule on the matter of trust, and that is, don't promise what you can't deliver. Not only has he forgotten his own mantra but also he has taken the next predictable step and is now blaming everyone but himself for the predicament that his environment policy is now in. Yes, he has a serious problem, and it is all of his own making. He cannot blame anyone else for this problem. It is a very serious predicament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of John Howard's `too clever by half' strategy to get the bill passed through the parliament, the Commonwealth government not only does not have any funding for an environment policy but also effectively does not have an environment policy. If the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="563"> government really considers the issue to be mainstream, you would expect it to have a realistic policy on the matter. You would not expect the future of a mainstream issue to be linked to the success of a doomed bill, would you? Apparently. But then again, maybe all this commitment to the environment is rhetoric. Maybe the environment policies never really mattered to the coalition. Certainly their behaviour in the past and their policies in the past suggest just that. Indeed, some of their actions now suggest just that: opening up uranium mining in Kakadu, for example, and lifting the ceiling on woodchip exports. We are seeing some of the true colours, but it was there to be seen during the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For decades Labor has led on the environment while coalition governments have either obstructed in this parliament, obfuscated, hidden or at best very reluctantly followed our lead. These actions show very clearly what the conservative parties in Australia think about the environment. Under a coalition government, for example, mining at Coronation Hill would have gone ahead. There is absolutely nothing surer. Uluru and Kakadu would have been handed to the Northern Territory government, which are hardly noted for their green characteristics. The wet tropics would have been logged and the Franklin would have been flooded. Those are all things that you supported in your time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition, in and out of government, does not have a strong environmental record. Without a funded environmental policy, we have to assume, I think fairly, that it has no intention of developing one. We are seeing all the bluff and bluster but behind it nothing. A briefing paper to the shadow cabinet prepared by Senator Ian Macdonald last year, I think, provides some insight into the motivations behind this coalition environment ruse. In that paper Senator Macdonald argues for flexibility so that the coalition can make announcements `on a lot of long&hyphen;term visionary matters' without committing itself to actually proceeding with them. Does that sound familiar? It is exactly what is happening right now. Interestingly, he cited the Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin as one such visionary project. Surprise, surprise! The coalition's Telstra <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> environment policy commits $163 million to the Murray&hyphen;Darling 2001 project. It is visionary; it cannot be delivered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What other long&hyphen;term visionary matters has the coalition committed itself to in its Telstra environment policy? There is a national vegetation initiative, land and water resources audits, reserve system payments, a coasts and clean seas initiative, and so on. Those are all very admirable. It is a pity that none of them are funded. The coalition's environment policy document, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Saving our natural heritage</EMPHASIS>, includes more than just these unfunded long&hyphen;term visionary matters. The important point is that it also endorses Labor's environment policies. In fact, we read that this whole new range of policies, which are essentially derivatives of ours anyway, are additional to Labor's budgeted funding for the environment and the sustainable agriculture elements of the primary industries portfolio, such as the national landcare program. That is very clearly written in your own policy document. The phrase&mdash;and I will quote it again&mdash;`additional to Labor's budgeted funding for the environment and the sustainable agriculture elements'&mdash;implies the coalition had committed themselves then and now to the previous government's forward estimates published in the 1995&hyphen;96 budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This assumption was made not only by a range of environmental groups and commentators but also by a lot of Liberal members. References were continually being made during the campaign to the `fact' that the coalition's funding for the environment doubled Labor's commitment because it was adding to Labor's budgeted funds. That is just another example of a very dirty trick that the coalition played on Australians during the election. The facts, as I understand them, are dramatically different. I would like to be wrong on this matter, but the answer of the Prime Minister to the question by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) yesterday indicates that forward estimates are not included in the coalition's promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday, when the Prime Minister was asked by the Leader of the Opposition to clarify what this commitment actually referred to, the Prime Minister said the commitment <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="564"> was `a commitment to add $1 billion to existing levels of environmental funding'. It is a bit different from the coalition's promise. Reading it that way&mdash;and I think it was probably carefully worded by the Prime Minister&mdash;the existing levels of environment funding include only the 1995-96 budget. In other words, it runs out on 30 June; it does not include the forward estimates published in the 1995-96 budget. Read in this light, the coalition's environment commitments, unfunded as they are, are very dramatically reduced. Its plans to boost spending on the environment by devoting $1 billion of the proceeds of the partial sale of Telstra to establish a Natural Heritage Trust, with $700 million to be spent over the next five years, indeed will only be making up the gaps that it is not meeting in the forward estimates in large part.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed so&hyphen;called initiatives to be funded through the trust can also be found in the revised forward estimates of the outgoing Labor government. In addition to our forward estimates during the campaign, we indicated that we had a whole new range of proposals and we presented revised forward estimates. A lot of the environment groups around this country thought that the now government's proposals were not only additional to our forward estimates but additional to our revised forward estimates. We indicated that we would fund a program for the Murray-Darling Basin very similar to that proposed by the government&mdash;an enhanced comprehensive reserve system, cleaner oceans and comprehensive coastal management policies. The difference is that we showed how we would fund them and we put them in our revised forward estimates. The Labor government was committed to funding these desirable programs through conventional means, not this hocus&hyphen;pocus through linking a very important sector of public policy, the environment, to the sale of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, some environment groups have assumed that they would get everything that we offered plus the $1 billion in the so-called heritage fund. That is not what the coalition have actually promised and is clearly not, from what the Prime Minister said yesterday, what they intend to deliver. Mr Howard <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> promised that the funding commitments in this document are additional to Labor's budgeted funding for the environment. I repeat: that is the promise he made. If you look at the fact that the funding commitments are only additional to this year's budget&mdash;not the forward estimates or the revised forward estimates&mdash;the government is actually promising to outlay some $700 million over five years. That is the express commitment from the heritage trust, with the balance to be held in reserve in perpetuity, and the interest then used to fund some projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The revised forward estimates that we were committed to&mdash;our forward estimates plus the election campaign programs&mdash;show that Labor had planned to spend $800 million on very similar programs over four years. That makes the government's environment policy look very thin indeed. Not only do they not have the funding&mdash;and they will not have it after the failure of the passage of this bill through the Senate&mdash;but their promise in any case was a hollow one. It was a real con job. They made it look as though they were going to add to Labor's programs as budgeted in the forward estimates and many were led to believe the revised forward estimates&mdash;a big boost for environment funding in this country. They received the accolades accordingly. They did not step back and say, `Hang on, we actually mean only in addition to Labor's 1995-96 programs.' It needs to be said that a lot of those programs come to an end at the end of 1995-96. We indicated in our forward estimates that we would have to pick them up again, and our revised forward estimates include that figure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition, in opposition, never came clean with the people of Australia about their intentions in this area. It is a very elaborate and successful con, but a despicable one. We saw it come home to roost in the Prime Minister's words yesterday. He has now had to acknowledge that he not only blackmailed the Australian people about the connection between the sale of Telstra and its environment policy but also misled them about the fact that those funds would not be additional to what Labor was proposing to put into environment policy. In the end that will be a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="565"> message that I certainly intend to get out to every corner of this country so people will know that, with or without the sale of Telstra, with or without the funds that were supposed to flow from that purpose, the government had no intention of expanding environmental programs in this country at all.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to participate, on behalf of the new coalition government, in the debate on this Telstra bill, which implements one of the major parts of our platform which was put to the Australian people prior to the 2 March election. I was very interested to listen to the shadow minister for the environment, the honourable member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence), when she challenged the coalition to put this subject to a referendum of the Australian people. I do not know where the former minister has been over the last few weeks, but the simple fact is that the coalition outlined a very clear program of a proposed sale of one-third of Telstra. We aim to use $7 billion of the $8 billion we expect to raise from that sale for the purposes of retiring debt. That will reduce interest rates and it will assist small business. Most importantly, also we aim to use the remaining $1 billion for the purposes of an investment in this nation's environmental future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those matters were put to the Australian people. The election on 2 March was a referendum on our policy. The result of that election saw the Labor Party reduced to a mere 49 seats out of 148 seats in this place. Ninety&hyphen;nine members of the House of Representatives are non-Labor members. I do not know where the former minister has been, but the simple fact is that the coalition was up-front, open and honest. We said what we proposed to do. We sought a mandate from the Australian people and that mandate was given to us in a resounding way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We aim to be an honest government; we aim to keep our promises, unlike the rhetoric and record of the former Labor government, which saw the former Prime Minister prior to the 1993 election prepared to do and say anything to crawl into office. Of course, no sooner had the Labor government been <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> elected in 1993 than those promises were junked one by one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have indicated that we intend to privatise only one-third of Telstra. We intend to allow only up to one-third of that one-third to be owned by non&hyphen;Australian interests. We also intend to use the proceeds of the sale of one-third of Telstra not for recurrent expenditure, as was the practice of the former government, but for the purposes of retiring debt and investing in this nation's environmental future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The crocodile tears shed by the former minister during the 20 minutes she berated the government should be entirely disregarded because this government has been honest, accountable and up&hyphen;front. We have sought and obtained the mandate of the Australian people. Despite the fact that we had one of the largest swings ever seen in Australian political history, the opposition is going to vote against our legislation in this place. What is more, the opposition is endeavouring to encourage the other place to thwart the mandate given to the coalition by the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill includes major safeguards. We are not giving anyone a blank cheque. We are saying that we are prepared to sell one-third of Telstra on very strict conditions. The approach of the Labor Party to policy making in this area has been somewhat hypocritical in so far as the former government said it would not sell major public assets. It went to the Australian people and said that major public assets would be retained in public ownership. Despite the fact that the former government said that it would not sell Qantas, the Commonwealth Bank or the Federal Airports Corporation, those promises, like so many election promises, were junked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a major difference between those on that side of the House and those on this side of the House. We told the Australian people what we proposed to do and, following our election, we have brought legislation into this place to implement our promises. Partial privatisation of Telstra is one element of a broader policy in the area of telecommunications aimed at giving Australia a world&hyphen;class telecommunications industry not only in terms <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="566"> of technology but also in terms of pricing and quality of service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other key elements include the introduction of legislative and institutional arrangements which will promote competition in provision of service and preserve and enhance universal service. As a member representing a regional area, I am very interested to make sure that the universal service obligations are continued. The government has pledged that they will be, and the legislation currently before the chamber guarantees that Australians in country areas will continue to receive a reasonable level of service from Telstra and other telecommunications providers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Partial privatisation will bring benefits to Australians right throughout the nation through a more efficient communications sector. There will be a reduction in public debt and therefore reduced pressure on interest rates. There will be a significant reinvestment in Australia's national heritage and increased investment opportunities for Australians. Because only one-third of the one-third of Telstra is available for purchase by overseas interests, the remaining two&hyphen;thirds of the one-third being offered for sale will be bought by Australian institutions and by the mums of dads of Australia. Most importantly, employees of the Telstra Corporation will be given the opportunity of investing in what is a very major and successful company throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It ought to be noted that, while Telstra has become more efficient in recent years, it still is not the most efficient telecommunications company in the world. In March 1995, the Bureau of Industry Economics published a detailed comparison of Telstra's performance with overseas carriers. It concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the introduction of competition in telecommunications Australia has moved ahead with the leading pack, but it is at the back of the leading group rather than the front. Relaxing the pace of reform would see Australia fall back into the trailing group of also-rans. Renewed effort is required to lift Australia towards international best practice.</PARA>
<PARA>That comparison looked at a number of individual indicators. It is interesting to note that in 1993, with respect to business fixed charges, Telstra was ranked 18th out of 28. In <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 1993, with respect to long distance call charges, Telstra was ranked 16th out of 26. In 1994, with respect to the national basket of prices, Telstra was ranked 14th out of 23. In 1994, with respect to the international call basket of prices, Telstra was ranked first out of 24. It did very well. In 1992, with respect to fault clearance, Telstra was ranked 15th out of 19.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is obvious that, while competition has assisted Telstra, we need to continue restructuring and we need to continue to improve efficiencies. I believe the partial privatisation of Telstra provided by this bill will assist in bringing about the improvements in Telstra's performance that we would all like to see.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members opposite, particularly the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Wilton), said that we ought not to have a linkage between the proposed one-third sale of Telstra and our $1 billion environmental package. He said that our policy on the environment should be funded from ordinary government revenue in much the same way as health was. I think that matter was also referred to by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple fact of the matter is that by making this linkage&mdash;by saying we are going to sell one-third of Telstra and that we will use $1 billion from the proceeds of that sale for the environment&mdash;we are indicating to the Australian people in a very responsible way that we can fund our environmental package. We are not saying that we are simply going to go out there and write cheques without any capacity to meet those cheques when they are presented. What we are saying is that we are prepared to retire $7 billion of debt, we are prepared to spend $1 billion on the environment, as outlined in our environmental policy, and we are prepared to show where the money is coming from.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former government was quite used simply to writing cheques without being accountable for where that money is coming from. As you would well know, Madam Deputy Speaker, the incoming government has been greeted by Beazley's $8 billion black hole. It means, of course, that we are going to have to work very hard over the next <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="567"> two annual budgets to rein in expenditure to raise $8 billion to clear the deficit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That contrasts in a very clear way the difference in approach between the government and the opposition. We are responsible. We say the environment is worth funding. We believe the environment is worth a $1 billion injection of funds. Labor believes that you should simply write cheques without being able to say where the money is coming from. So we are going to spend $1 billion on the environment and we are going to sell one-third of Telstra. The money for the environment will come from the sale of Telstra, and I believe that is very responsible and appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Natural Heritage Trust of Australia will be the most major environmental initiative ever made by any government in this nation. For once, a government has been prepared to stand up to be counted and to grasp the nettle to ensure that Australia's environment is restored for future generations. The money invested in the Natural Heritage Trust will be devoted to capital projects to maintain and replenish our environmental infrastructure. All interest earned from the trust will be devoted to recurrent expenditure on environmental projects and the further advancement of sustainable agriculture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While we are being bagged by the opposition, I think it would be illuminating just to outline what some of those capital projects are. We really ought to reiterate how determined we are to make a positive contribution to our nation's environmental future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> There are five capital projects to be funded from the money invested in the Natural Heritage Trust. One of the projects is a national vegetation initiative to tackle Australia's land and water degradation problems. Madam Deputy Speaker, you will be pleased to know that we intend to spend $318 million over five years. When you look at our record as a nation over more than 200 years of European settlement in relation to the devegetation of Australia, we have nothing to be proud of. Collectively, we have nothing to be proud of. Look at the way that our nation has been denuded of vegetation and the way in which we over the years have not appreci ated that we hold our environment in trust for future generations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the coalition went before the Australian people prior to the election on 2 March and said that we were going to do something about it. We were the first prepared to do anything about it. We bring in a very positive platform, and the opposition seeks to thwart us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also intend to rehabilitate the Murray-Darling Basin through the implementation of the Murray-Darling 2001 project, and $163 million will be spent over five years. We also will undertake a national land and water resources audit, and that will cost $32 million over five years. We will also implement a comprehensive national reserve system to protect Australia's biodiversity&mdash;$80 million over four years. As a member for a coastal electorate, I am particularly pleased that we are going to spend $100 million over four years on the coast and clean seas initiative to tackle the pollution problems in our coastal areas.</PARA>

There were some at the fringes who opposed the way in which we planned to fund it, but the simple fact of the matter is that every major environmental group felt that what we aimed to achieve on the environment was very positive. We got a clean bill of health from the environmental movement, although we did have some criticism over how we planned to fund it.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It makes absolutely no difference at all to Australians who actually owns the Telstra Corporation. What does matter is the job that Telstra does. It is important that Telstra be allowed to grow. It is important that Telstra be allowed to restructure and become more efficient. It is important that Telstra be required to continue to provide a high quality level of service to Australians throughout the nation. It does not really matter who actually owns Telstra. What is important is the job that Telstra does.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government said that it was prepared to sell only one-third of Telstra. Had the Labor Party been re-elected to office, then it is highly likely that all of Telstra would have been flogged off. We really ought to look at the comments made by the former Prime Minister in June 1994. Of course, members opposite would seek to dissent from the remarks of the former Prime Minister in 1994, but Paul Keating disclosed his attitude. When asked on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> program in June 1994 whether it mattered if Telstra were publicly or privately owned, he replied, `Not of its essence, no.' So Paul Keating said that it did not matter who owned Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition believes it is important that two-thirds of Telstra be owned by the government, that two-thirds of Telstra be retained in public ownership. We have pledged that in this term of office we will not in any way, shape or form sell more than the one-third of Telstra. That is why this legislation provides only for the sale of one-third of Telstra, but <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the former Prime Minister said that it did not matter `of its essence' whether Telstra were publicly or privately owned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also ought to be appreciated that the former government endeavoured to flog off parts of Telstra. They attempted to sell <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yellow Pages</EMPHASIS> and Mobilenet. The simple fact of the matter is that we keep our promises with respect to what we say we are going to do. The Labor Party now come in here and claim to be opposed to the sale of Telstra. The reality is that in 1994 their then leader said it did not matter who owned Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to appreciate that with this bill the government is reaffirming its credentials of being up&hyphen;front and honest. We announced in the election platform that we intended to sell one-third of Telstra so that we could retire $7 billion of debt and so that we could make a $1 billion investment in Australia's environmental future. There are many things we are going to improve in Australia when our environmental program is implemented.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The public is under no allusions that this is the start of the full privatisation of Telstra. Selling one-third of Telstra will inevitably lead to the sale of the whole of Telstra. The only reason the government is not selling all of Telstra is that it has doubts about the capacity of the Australian market to absorb the total bill. While the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith) expressed doubt in his second reading speech on this Telstra bill as to the capacity of the Australian people to absorb $8 billion worth of debt, he appreciates it certainly could not absorb $24 billion worth of debt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In any event, even the partial privatisation of Telstra will effectively change its whole mode of operation. Just as you cannot be a little bit pregnant, you cannot be a little bit private. There will be a fundamental shift in philosophy. Currently, Telstra is owned by the Australian public. It is presumed&mdash;and indeed is the case&mdash;that Telstra has been incorporated for the benefit of the public and it provides its service on that basis. That will entirely change with the privatisation of Telstra. The presumption will be that Telstra is functioning as a private company whose only reason for being is one thing&mdash;profit. The more it can squeeze out of the consumer, the more money it will make. The less service it provides per consumer dollar, the more profit it will make.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The directors, as directors of a privately owned company, will have an obligation to the company and the minority shareholders to ensure that they discharge their duties as directors with due diligence and with a view to maximising that profit. Those obligations are not light. A director who fails to perform their duties with due care and diligence in pursuit of the profitability of the company may be guilty of a criminal offence. A director may be personally liable to compensate the company or others, such as minority shareholders, for any loss or damage they suffer. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that context, it is not good enough to say that the universal service obligations of Telstra will be protected by the proposed legislation. The pursuit of profit will inevitably put pressure on confining and limiting that universal service obligation. When we look at how the universal service obligation is framed in part 2C of the bill, we see it is a corporate lawyer's dream. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A universal service obligation is referred to as an obligation to provide `reasonable access'&mdash;not absolute access but `reasonable access'&mdash;to `standard telephone services'. We are not talking about the technology of which Telstra is at the forefront. That obligation is referred to as one which should be fulfilled as efficiently and economically as practicable. As soon as a lawyer sees the words `as practicable', it is open slather&mdash;it is a subjective judgment and extremely broad in its discretion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Companies are even protected in providing a universal service. They only have to provide information `to the greatest extent possible without undue damage to a carrier's interest being caused by the disclosure of confidential commercial information'. How is anyone going to test that in a court of law? It is simply a non-existent universal service obligation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I mentioned, it is not simply a question of providing standard telephone services, which the bill refers to. Telstra is now well and truly at the forefront of technology. We in the city have the opportunity to connect to the integrated services digital network&mdash;ISDN as it is commonly known&mdash;which can carry voice, text and video all simultaneously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have access to a multitude of network based services on offer, like multiple simultaneous fax transmission and paging services and a myriad of other products that can be connected to a network&mdash;including access to a very sophisticated databank network. We have access to that from our electoral offices. It is quite impossible to practise in many areas today without that technology. In a legal practice, it would be quite impossible to practise without access to those on-line facilities. They are services which are rapidly spreading throughout country and regional <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="570"> Australia. For the ISDN network to be completed, it will involve a cost in the vicinity of $2 billion. That is a massive input into centres which, in many instances, on a balance sheet will not have the population which justifies that capital investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You might ask yourself: will a private company in pursuit of the profit motive engage in that capital investment if it is simply not going to get the return? The answer is that it will not. Country people and people in regional centres are going to miss out on that investment in technology. Businesses are going to be denied access to that technology; schools are going to be denied access to that technology; children are going to be denied access to that technology in their studies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While young children in the cities are rapidly learning this technology and about on-line facilities, kids in the bush are going to be left well and truly in their wake. Yet kids in the bush are going to have to compete for university places with kids in the cities. They are going to be left floundering without experience in this technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that the technological revolution is now so far advanced that, unless employees have competence in this area, their future employability is going to be significantly prejudiced. Employees and trainees in the cities are going to have access to this technology, but country people are going to be significantly disadvantaged in their employment opportunities. Kids are going to be left only one step ahead of the radio service of the flying doctor while kids in the cities are becoming wizards with this new technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We in this House would all know a number of people who are employed by Telstra or who are employed by businesses which are contracted to Telstra. It is literally a massive industry. What is going to happen to those 90,000 employees if Telstra is privatised? We have indications from the government about that. In the Senate on 1 May 1996, Senator Michael Baume, in advocating the sale of Telstra, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have seen employment in Telstra blow out to something like 96,000 as against 60,000, a level <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> competitive with comparable overseas organisations and a level which, I understand, is some kind of target. That indicates present overemployment of something like 30,000 people.</PARA>
<PARA>We will have 30,000 more people on the dole queues. We will have 30,000 more families concerned about how they are going to educate their children. We will have 30,000 more families concerned as to how they are going to pay their mortgages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A very significant fear that all Australians should be aware of is the flow-on consequences of massive unemployment of highly trained and highly skilled people arising from the government's actions. They are not my words but the words of Senator Baume about what he perceives as the requirements of a privatised Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen attempts by government members to ruin and downplay the reputation of a company, in curious circumstances, where the government is attempting to sell one-third of it. The fundamental requirement of any effective administration is to get the facts. If one looks at Telstra's financial record for the six&hyphen;month period ending 31 December 1995, one can see an increase of 16.6 per cent in profit over the previous corresponding period. Revenue totalled $7,638 million, an increase of $631 million, or nine per cent. During the six-month period, $686 million was provided for an interim dividend to the Commonwealth government, compared with only $413 million for the previous corresponding period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to revenue growth, the results in Telstra's balance sheet reflected a return on equity of 20.2 per cent, a debt equity ratio of 28 per cent and an interest cover of 9.9 times. They are very sound financial indicators as to the success of Telstra. During the six-month reporting period, Telstra increased capital expenditure by 45.5 per cent. They reinvested $1,938 million in the funding of existing and new business growth and major capital expenditure programs, which is a massive investment into the infrastructure of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra have achieved 90 per cent digital mobile net coverage of Australia, almost matching analog which is at 91 per cent. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="571"> Also, they have spent $3.9 billion on the digital broadband cable network, which is now available to an estimated 2.4 million Australians, and the $3.3 billion future mode of operation project, which involves digitisation of customer lines, is now 68 per cent complete.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This technology has a multiplier effect on all businesses. Virtually no business has been untouched by the technological advances and the additional profitability that Telstra is now able to deliver because of that massive technological investment into the infrastructure of this country. Again, if Telstra is privatised, regional Australia&mdash;country Australia&mdash;will not see much of that technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If operating profit after tax for the six-month period ended 31 December is projected over the 12-month period, which ends in about seven weeks time, Telstra will have an operating profit after tax of $2.4 billion. In less than 3&half; years, Telstra will more than recover by way of profit the $8 billion which is going to be received in this fire sale if the government is correct. That is literally what it is. It is ripping up the floorboards to stoke the fire. The trouble is that, once too many floorboards are ripped up, the fire becomes ineffective. Indeed, when all the floorboards are used the fire will go out. That will be a very real tragedy for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the effect on the balance of payments, Telstra has had some massive successes. Telstra has continued to pursue opportunities internationally, in particular in the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region. A new high capacity optical fibre link, known as TVH, linking Thailand, Vietnam and Hong Kong, has been established, in which Telstra is an initial party and a major investor. That program was officially launched in February of this year and is providing Vietnam with its first international submarine link with the rest of the world. PT Mitra Global Telekomunikasi Indonesia, in which Telstra, through a wholly owned subsidiary, has a 20 per cent shareholding, assumed management of the telephone network in central Java in January of 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You simply do not make those inroads, you do not have those successes, unless you are <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> competing with the best in the world and beating the best of the world. That is Telstra's record. It is a record which we can all be immensely proud of. It is a record that we can foster.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government makes tokenistic gestures to nationalism and national pride by speeches, for instance, on Anzac Day indicating intentions to preserve the national flag. We in the opposition are talking about meaningful nationalism&mdash;pride in a company which is a flagship for our nation, which is beating the best of the world and one which we as Australians each have a stake in. The government is literally going to flog it off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra is an essential utility providing essential services to many organisations and it enters into contracts primarily with Australian companies. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) in his powerful speech indicated the significance of that flow&hyphen;on technology to many other companies involved in the electronics industry in Australia. The electronics industry is particularly significant to our national interest because it is using Australia as the smart country&mdash;it is using our talent, our wealth of education and our general sophistication in terms of training&mdash;to earn very significant foreign revenue. It is fostering industries such as the electronics, telecommunications and computer industries, which are going to prevent this country becoming a labour sweatshop, as so many other countries have had to become in order to raise foreign revenue. To put those successes which we are having at risk, as will inevitably be the case by the selling of Telstra, is foolish in the extreme.   </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final point I would like to make, among many that have been made by my colleagues, is that Telstra, being in the position that it has achieved, has the capacity to crush its opposition if it is left unchecked. That has to be conceded. It effectively has a monopoly of telephone lines. It effectively has a monopoly of technology such that it can easily obliterate its opposition. How is the government going to stop that obliteration, certainly in circumstances where the minister will be unable to give any directions to the company as to how it should engage in its business <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="572"> practices? The directors themselves will have an obligation to maximise the prospects of their company succeeding against the competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Telstra knocks out that competition, which it is capable of doing, it will establish a total monopoly, to the very great detriment of consumers. It will be a monopoly over which the government has no control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we are promised by the government $1 billion for the environment. Is that promise legitimate? At the same time as the minister promised that money in his second reading speech, he referred to the need for instalment purchase arrangements if the scoping study finds that the domestic equity markets would find it difficult to cope with equity raising of the order of magnitude envisaged. For government members to stand up and profess to say honestly that the mums and dads of this country have a spare $8 billion lying around is foolhardy; it is a nonsense. The government recognises the difficulty it is going to have in raising that money. So we are looking at all kinds of hire&hyphen;purchase arrangements, arrangements to pay by instalments, and various forms of lay&hyphen;by arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, the government is trying to blackmail us by holding the environment as a hostage, but it is not as honourable as normal hostage takers. Normal hostage takers will deliver the hostage when the dough is delivered, when the money is presented. We are not even going to see the money; we are going to see a payment by instalment situation. They will still hold the environment hostage until that payment by instalment process, the lay&hyphen;by and hire&hyphen;purchase arrangements, is completed. It is an outrage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been a member of this parliament for a very brief time but I have been an observer of national politics, I must say, for quite some time. I have never seen any government support any piece of legislation on the basis of benefiting another sector of society, or holding another part of the infrastructure of the country or an asset of the Australian people as hostage. It is hopefully the last time we will see it. Those opposite are in the capacity of custodians of our great nation and this example of starting to flog off Telstra, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> one of our very great emblems of national pride, is something which we oppose vigorously. I strongly support the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham).</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I want to clear up one matter that the honourable member for Barton (Mr McClelland) seems to have confused with respect to our position on the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill. It is not that we are holding the environment hostage for the passage of the Telstra bill. It is that we are honouring our commitments and funding our commitments. Unlike the Labor Party of the last 13 years, we do not believe it is right to make promises that we will deliver certain things in government and then not deliver them, and we want to show to the Australian people that we will fund the commitments that we have made, and that is why during the election our policy on the environment was matched with the policy on how to fund the environmental package. That is simply all it is. It is not holding it hostage; it is saying that, unlike the last government, we intend to be responsible economic managers and we promised the Australian people only things that we can deliver.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not wish to comment for long on the bill today because I think most of the subjects will have been well covered by the time the list of speakers is completed, but I do wish to put on the record today my support for the Telstra bill. On 2 March, when the Australian people dusted away 13 years of Labor cobwebs, they rejected a government whose vision for the nation extended no further than their own return to office, whose policy platform was rickety and unstable and whose campaign was based solely on fear. More importantly, the people voted for a new direction for our nation, for policies that had been clearly enunciated by the coalition team during the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="573"> The Labor strategists, ideologues without both ideas and ideals, set out to make the election a referendum on Medicare and on Telstra, and so it was. The results are very clearly in and the Australian people, hungry to get this nation back on the road to pros perity, have thrown Labor out. As the saying goes, they did not count the votes in most of the electorates that the Liberal Party picked up; they weighed them. It is with the heavy backing of that huge election victory that this government embarks on the process to reform Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the months of public conjecture over the future of Telstra I have not heard one real argument against its part&hyphen;privatisation. We have been subjected to the fallacious line from the Labor Party that to keep Telstra the way it is is to keep it strong. It seems to me that I have heard that used before. It was used with reference to ANL. The Labor government made a token effort to privatise our national shipping line but were stopped by their bosses, the ACTU and the Maritime Union. Keeping ANL in government ownership did not keep ANL strong&mdash;in fact quite the opposite. It sank it, and Australia's taxpayers funded the $30 million a year losses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Telstra arguments are not only similar; they are coming from the very same sources, this time with assistance from those on the opposition benches. The ALP has quickly forgotten its enthusiasm for privatisation in the late 1980s and early 1990s. On this side of the chamber we believe the work we do should be for the betterment of all Australians. We believe the changes that we seek to effect with the passage of this legislation will provide long lasting benefits for our nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian telecommunications monopoly is long gone. In a very real sense, the industry itself has already been privatised with Telstra having competition in the mobile communications and long distance markets. Next year, when the market is further deregulated, there will be still more providers, at least one of which will compete with Telstra for the highly profitable local call market. There can be no doubt that new technologies and new competition will prove a boon to the Australian consumer. While government ownership may have been a necessity in setting up a monopoly and its associated infrastructure, we must assess the value and the risk of a government run body competing with private enterprise in a deregulated market.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The end of the local Telstra monopoly on local calls must mean, by nature, a drop in its market share. Just how large a slice of the pie it will be able to keep for itself will determine its future profitability. There is no doubt that Telstra has the ability to succeed on a long&hyphen; term basis. It has the ability to continue to dominate the Australian telecommunications industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, as with all business enterprises, there is a risk. As the competition intensifies and Telstra diversifies in an attempt to be a significant global provider, the risk will become greater and the entire risk will fall on the taxpayer. Already there is much speculation over the roll&hyphen;out of cable for television and interactive services. Telstra and Optus are at war to grab market share. The Telstra roll&hyphen;out is costing taxpayers billions of dollars. Its cable television partner, Foxtel, pays for none of the infrastructure and will receive payment for every subscriber signed by Telstra.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Ordinary Australians are having the dice rolled for them. The Telstra CEO, Frank Blount, only last year circulated to Telstra senior executives the news clip concerning the bankruptcy of typewriter giant Smith Corona. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All I am trying to say to my team is that it can happen to this company real easy.</PARA>
<PARA>Not for a minute am I suggesting that Telstra is on the brink, and nor was Mr Blount. He was merely reminding his people of the high risk stakes involved in business, any business. Governments of many countries are seeing the benefits in telecommunications privatisation. Seventeen countries, including France, Germany and Russia, will embark on privatisation schemes this year alone. Partial privatisation will ensure a lean and confident Telstra that is able to compete in Australia and around the world.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="574">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The American giant, AT&amp;T, recently won a $30 million contract in India at the expense of Telstra despite a huge aid loan given to that nation to help establish Telstra's credentials. If Telstra is to achieve its stated aim to be the leading provider of electronic communication and information services in Australia and the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region and a significant global provider, then it needs the discipline and accountability that only the private sector can provide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This part&hyphen;privatisation will see Telstra remain in Australian hands. The safeguards against majority foreign ownership are in place. Just 35 per cent of the one-third of Telstra will be available to foreign investors and those individual foreign investors will be restricted to a minimum of five per cent of the total private shares.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Included in this legislation is the provision for a range of enforcement and remedial action over foreign investment. The Federal Court will be given the power to order divestment of shares and both the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) and Telstra will be able to obtain injunctions to prevent or remedy ownership breaches.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These foreign shareholders will be further restricted in that indirect interests and interests of their associates will be included as part of their stake. If these shares are sold in more than one single tranche, there will be lower limits on foreign ownership thus allowing Australians to purchase 65 per cent of whatever stock is available. It will be important that Australians get behind the share offer and there will be encouragement by way of special incentives to invest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is keen to see the shares allocated to a diverse range of Australian investors, including individuals and institutions. In all, this is a tremendous package, and I am sure Australians will respond with gusto to the offer of Telstra shares&mdash;in the same manner as they responded to the floats of Qantas and Woolworths.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The revenue gained from the one-third privatisation of Telstra will not be wasted, unlike the proceeds from the Labor Party privatisations of the late 1980s and early <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 1990s which were used to prop up the budget bottom line. This revenue will be put to use in two critical areas for our future: namely, in the reduction of our debt and in a massive environmental package. These are areas that concern most Australians. I say `most Australians', because those opposite who were here in the last parliament occupied the government benches for 13 years and proved conclusively over that time that they cared little about debt, let alone the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How many times did we hear from the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) that, although the actual figures did not look good, the underlying figures were encouraging? `Underlying' was the catchcry of Labor's term in office. How prophetic that was. At the March election they went under, lying&mdash;lying to the Australian people about our intentions and lying to them about the massive size of the debt. `We are in surplus,' they claimed. The people came to the same conclusion, adjudging them to have a surplus of about 35 members in the House of Representatives, and promptly remedying the situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's record on the environment is no better. The Labor Party paid lip-service to it, through Graham Richardson when he discovered that there were some votes in the issue. However, it did not actually make any difference to any of the major problems facing the environment in Australia&mdash;unlike the environment package that we have been putting to the Australian people. This government aims to do something tangible about the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will implement a coordinated series of programs to restore and protect our national heritage, and by doing so will confront directly many of the nation's environmental black spots. Chief among these programs will be the national vegetation initiative, which will lower salinity levels in water, rehabilitate degraded land and provide us with a sustainable forestry industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Murray-Darling 2001 project will be undertaken, in conjunction with the states, to increase the viability of the land in one of the nation's most productive areas. This government will begin to work to safeguard our wetlands, waterways, coasts and oceans. We <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="575"> will act to protect our endangered species and control feral animals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australians are increasingly conscious of the environment. Both prevention and cure must be applied to ensure that Australia's natural resources are sustainable in the long term. They are our national heritage and they are our national future. To secure that future, we should have invested in them over the last 13 years, but it is left to this government to invest for the future. The legacy of the Labor government means that there is nothing saved for a rainy day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Public opinion on the partial sale of Telstra is somewhat divided. We have seen Telstra grow out of Telecom and, before that, from the Postmaster&hyphen;General's Department, which was established to set up Australia's telephone, telegraph and postal services. Telstra is an Australian institution and it is natural that there would be some reluctance to tamper with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, if the question were put to Australians, `Do you favour a partial sale of Telstra if it results in cheaper phone services, less risk to the taxpayer, lower foreign debt and a cleaner, safer, more sustainable environment?' I think the answer would definitely be in the positive rather than the negative. I believe very few would be against it, save those who place their interests above those of the national interest&mdash;and, sadly, many of those people sit on the opposition side, both in this chamber and in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There can be no doubt that this bill will sail through the House of Representatives, but the public mouthings of some senators have led us to believe that its passage through the Senate will be somewhat less than smooth. That is a shame. One could have predicted the Labor Party's opposition. The reason it is so diminished in this House is that it has lost touch with much of its former base and is consequently now reliant upon special interest groups, the ACTU and the union movement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party has been consistent in its hypocrisy all along&mdash;selling the Commonwealth Bank, Qantas and the Federal Airports Corporation&mdash;but, for some unknown reason, it has decided suddenly to oppose the partial sale of Telstra. However, I wonder a great <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> deal about the Democrats. Their existence is due more to the vagaries of the system used to elect senators than to any public support for their policies&mdash;and one could ask what policies the Democrats have ever put to the Australian people. During election campaigns they make promises to every special interest group and fringe group, knowing full well that they will never have the opportunity or the requirement to deliver. They take their seats in the Senate and claim that their mandate is to `keep the bastards honest'. One has to wonder who will keep the Democrats honest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Why are the Democrats trying so hard to force this government to be dishonest in the policies that it put to the electorate? Since the March election they seem intent on forcing the coalition to break rather than keep its promises. Though at times they sound like the old Labor lunatic Left, I remind the Democrats that they are not Her Majesty's loyal opposition. They sit on the crossbenches&mdash;although as they look at the motley crew on the Senate Labor Party benches they might be forgiven for their delusions of grandeur and power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As elected representatives in this parliament our first responsibility&mdash;and that of the Democrats&mdash;to the people of Australia is to take an objective view. I believe the Democrats have shirked their responsibility to the Australian people. The Australian people deserve more democracy rather than more demagoguery from this party, which is desperately trying to hang on to what it regards as its base of support. Rather than looking at the electoral pendulum it should recognise that all the coalition is trying to do is keep its election promises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I wish to record my support for this bill. I hope that in the Senate the Labor Party might see the error of its ways and support the bill in its entirety. I know that that is probably a forlorn hope but I look forward to the contributions of some of the other members of the opposition in the hope that they will be more sensible and realistic than some of the contributions I have already heard.</PARA></SPEECH>

I wish them well, as I do the panel of which you, Mr Deputy Speaker Truss, are a member.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This debate in relation to the partial privatisation of Telstra is one which should be conducted, if it were a mature debate, by looking at the benefits or otherwise to the Australian community of the proposal on the sale of Telstra. Much of what we have heard in the debate though has tended to go to a more base consideration of ideological drive&mdash;a view that either public ownership is by its very nature a good thing or that private ownership is by its very nature a good thing. Not a lot of light has been shed on the specifics of the situation with respect to Telstra or what a partial sale of Telstra will mean for ordinary Australians. That has particularly been so for many of the contributions I have heard from members of the government in this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra is a unique government service enterprise. Not surprisingly, just about every speaker on the government side has stood to tell us that the Labor Party supported the sale of Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank and therefore it is illogical or unreasonable of us not to support the partial sale of Telstra. If they were to apply some rigour to each of those cases they might actually discern that there is a significant difference between them and Telstra. This is not a debate in strict fundamental ideological terms about public ownership of everything or the sale of everything, or at least it should not be. It should be an assessment about each case on its merits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to have a look at some of those aspects of Telstra which are unique and which do make it a necessary enterprise for the government to maintain 100 per cent ownership of. In terms of the use that Australian people make of it, it is without parallel as a government enterprise service. The fact of life is that more than any other service&mdash;even more so, I think, than Australia Post&mdash;it is a service accessed by people from one corner <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the country to the other. It is accessed more regularly than any other service we provide. Comparisons have been made with Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank on that and other issues. Qantas is regularly used by about five per cent of the Australian population. The Commonwealth Bank, I understand, has something like a 20 per cent market share. But, even in the deregulated market in telecommunications, Telstra currently enjoys a market share of around about 85 per cent and is still the major supplier of critical services to residential Australians. There is no comparison between the three.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra is a highly profitable venture. Unlike Qantas and, to an extent, unlike the Commonwealth Bank, it actually provides a return to the government. It recorded an after&hyphen;tax profit in the 1994&hyphen;95 financial year of $1.75 billion. The honourable member for Sturt (Mr Pyne) has just been talking about the burden it imposes on the taxpayer. What arrant nonsense. The taxpayer has not contributed money to Telstra. In fact, the reverse is the case. In the case of Qantas, you might have had an argument, and that is one of the reasons why the former Labor government took a different position with Qantas. When we were considering the sale of Qantas one of the things that stuck in my mind as one of those glaring statistics was the fact that, if you took every dividend that Qantas ever returned to the government as its shareholder and added them all up, you would have just about enough money to build one decent secondary school.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the comparison with Telstra? Telstra returned a profit of $1.75 billion and, to the people of Australia, its shareholders, those of us here in this parliament with the trust of the community in our hands, it returned $944 million on budget last year. The honourable member for Sturt wants to tell us that it is a drain on public funds. What a dill! The fact is that, unlike Qantas or even the Commonwealth Bank, it is a source of revenue as well as a provider of services. It is unique amongst the enterprises that this government has in trust for the people of Australia. It should not be forgotten that that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="577"> is the role in which it is held. You hold it in trust for the people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra raises its own funds. When you turn a profit of $1.75 billion you do not have to go back to the shareholder and say, `We need a bit more equity; give us some money.' When it needs to raise additional capital, it is more than able to do that in the markets, and that is exactly what it does&mdash;unlike Qantas, which comes back to the government on a regular basis and says, `We need more equity,' or `We need that loan written off.' That was the situation we confronted on a regular basis with Qantas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unlike Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank, Telstra is involved in leading edge technology. Not only is it leading edge technology here in Australia; it is world standard leading edge technology. It just happens to be in an industry, information technology and telecommunications, IT and T, which I strongly argue is the most critical industry to our nation's future wealth. More than any other single industry, IT and T will determine the standard of living that our children have into the 21st century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are fortunate in Australia to have in public ownership, owned by the people, one of the world's best IT and T firms, a firm which IBM and Microsoft are keen to establish partnerships with. It is not that we have a massive market here in Australia&mdash;we do not&mdash;but they know that Telstra is at the world's leading edge in a range of technologies which are critical to the long&hyphen;term wealth of the Western world. And we own it.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to the matter of industry and the role which Telstra has played. It promotes within its own purchasing structure&mdash;and it is one of the major purchasing organisations in the country&mdash;an Australian made policy and  has a record of purchasing 70 per cent Australian made. We have a number of firms in Australia&mdash;Alcatel, Siemens, NEC and a lot of Australian based firms that are suppliers to them&mdash;that are based in Australia rather than in Europe or Asia because Telstra requires it of them if they are going to supply to Telstra. If it were not for that policy, we would not have Alcatel in Sydney exporting hundreds of millions of dollars of telecommunications switching equipment into China. If it were not for that policy, we would not have Telstra effectively competing in open markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Sturt raised an example of Telstra missing a contract for telecommunications equipment in India. I do not know the details of that case but I am quite happy to accept that it is so; we are not going to win every contract. What an absurd point. But I can equally run off a list of overseas contracts they have secured against the world's best competition where they have knocked over AT&amp;T, Ericsson and a whole range of other people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that Telstra has performed not just for us as shareholders but for a range of Australian based firms, small and medium&hyphen;sized enterprises which feed into that critical IT and T industry. Those opposite do not want to have a controlling interest in how that is done in the future; they want to forgo the opportunity that such ownership gives.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me come to that in a minute.

If you want the proof of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="578"> that, go back and have a look at some of the outcomes when we partially privatised. We found out that once you partially privatise that is it; you no longer have a controlling interest where you can dictate those things. The board of directors is required to look at the shareholders register and ensure that the shareholders receive the maximum return from that company. It may not be the best return for the nation as a whole but for that company they have to get the best return.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we were in government, holding Telstra in trust for the people of Australia, we used that ownership not just to return $944 million on budget as we did last year but to grow other Australian industry. I have been involved with a lot of IT and T firms in Australia that have worked with Telstra and relied upon Telstra to get up and running; they rely upon partnerships with Telstra for their R&amp;D to develop leading edge items. We are talking about small firms, not mega firms, that provide some of the world's best technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I could mention companies in Brisbane such as Mitec, a small firm in partnership with Telstra for a number of microwave transmission equipment sales. It also happens to be good enough to supply the Soviet space program with equipment. The sort of R&amp;D they need to invest in that is difficult for a small firm in Australia to come by. What makes you think that a board of directors, whose legal obligation is to look after their shareholders, is going to worry about that when they can get something off the shelf from the USA or from Sweden or from Japan? You know the answer to that just as well as I do. You are making a terrible mistake that will be hard for us to rectify when we regain the treasury bench.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Administratively, Telstra is involved in a cross&hyphen;subsidisation to ensure that people who are not in the most economically serviced areas are able to get the service just as well and at the same price. You cannot simply legislate or establish other guidelines that will force that to occur. If you do not own it, if you do not have the sole say in those matters, it will be whittled away over time, as surely as I am standing here. It will not happen <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tomorrow, it will not happen this Christmas, but over the next five years those members who serve provincial and country areas will see that occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You might say, `No, we are in government; the minister will be able to do something about it,' but he or she will not. The minister will not have the power to do that for a couple of reasons&mdash;not least of all because in your own bill you are removing the power of the minister to direct the board. So go and read your own bill and you will find out that you are taking that power away. The other reason that you will not be able to do it is that those private shareholders, the directors on that board, will not have that as an obligation under law to observe. In fact, it is quite the contrary. They would be failing in their responsibilities as directors if they did take it into account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members on the other side from provincial and country centres and some of my colleagues on the Labor benches are going to find that those charges will vary, will increase, and those in communities that are not heavily populated will pay a price for your foolishness in regard to this bill. It will not affect my electorate; downtown Brisbane is not going to be hit by this in three or four years time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us put to rest this simplistic rhetoric from the other side that the Labor Party supported the sale of the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas so this is just opportunism or political point&hyphen;scoring. It is nothing of the sort. They are very substantially different areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the process of trying to get this bill through, the Liberal and National parties&mdash;in a half&hyphen;smart measure; a too smart by half measure&mdash;have decided to link it to funding for the environment. I do not think there is anyone in the community who views that other than as a cynical tactical ploy. If you had the genuine concern for the environment which you claim, why do you make it conditional upon the sale of Telstra? There is no other government program that you are proposing that is conditional upon the sale of Telstra. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="579">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those environmental programs that you wish to fund through the revenue from the sale of Telstra are important. Indeed, they match pretty much what we undertook to do at the election as well. If they are important, and I believe they are, they deserve to be funded on budget the same as everything else. It should not be a question of holding the gun at the head of the community and saying, `The environment is important, but it is only important if you let us sell Telstra. If you don't let us sell Telstra, it is not important enough for us to fund it.' It is too smart by half. It is a cynical political ploy and the people of Australia have seen through it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other argument which members of the Liberal and National parties have used is to claim that we should acquiesce in this because they claim to have a mandate for it. A mandate is a strange thing. It seems to be a right which some in governments of all political persuasions claim when it suits them, but they conveniently hold a different view at other times. The fact is that I got elected to this parliament, as we all were, and I was elected on a very clear undertaking to the people of Brisbane that I would fight tooth and nail against the sale of Telstra, and I intend to do just that. Let me make it plain: as far as I am concerned, as the member for Brisbane, I have got a mandate to oppose you every step of the way on the sale of Telstra and I intend to do just that. But there are people on the other side who want to talk with a duplicitous view of a mandate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to quote to you from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> the comments of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). On 15 September 1987 he said this about mandates:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When people vote at an election they do not vote on only one issue. The mandate theory of politics from the point of view of proper analysis has always been absolutely phoney.</PARA>
<PARA>What did John Howard say? He said, `It is absolutely phoney.' He also said people do not vote on one issue&mdash;and by and large that is right. What he said in a moment of candour on 15 September 1987 is something I agree with. You do not have the right to demand of me or my colleagues, or the Democrats, or anybody else, that we acquiesce and lie down <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to let you sell Telstra, because we have the same obligation to our constituents as you would claim to have to yours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me turn to the question of foreign ownership, because quite a bit has been made by the government of the fact that this is going to continue to be a predominantly Australian owned enterprise, although I hope I have been able to demonstrate that it would be an Australian owned enterprise in which those things we regard as important for Telstra will have been lost because you, as the government, will forgo your authority over the board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question of foreign ownership is important and we took that into account very carefully with respect to the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas. But you went to the election and promised the people of Australia that you would ensure that the foreign ownership standards of an Australian share register would be maintained by establishing two classes of shares, a class A share and a class B share; that by establishing two classes of shares you would restrict foreigners to class B shares. For some reason you have decided not to do that in the legislation. I have not heard anyone on the other side explain to us why it is you have decided to break that promise. There has been a lot said here about keeping promises. Tell us, folks: why did you break the promise you gave the people of Australia that you would establish a class B share and that share would be the only share that foreigners could buy? You have decided to break that promise and dust it under the carpet. You might like to come clean in the debate, which is nearing conclusion. Someone on the other side might actually like to tell us why it is you have decided to dishonestly break that undertaking that you gave to the people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another thing that sticks in my mind with respect to foreign ownership is the sheer magnitude of the task being imposed upon the Australian financial markets. An $8 billion float is an enormous float, the likes of which the Australian markets have never seen. To get $1 billion Australian equity into an organisation&mdash;which is the level of equity sought for Qantas&mdash;has proven difficult. From <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="580"> time to time, in fact, the foreign ownership has gone above the limits we set. I think the government is going to have enormous problems actually getting the markets to put that amount of Australian equity into it. There is not $8 billion worth of equity out there to put in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I repeat what a mystifying decision it is to repeal the ministerial direction to the board. Why do that? I suspect the reason is that the government knows it cannot direct the board once there is a private shareholder. Whether it is one per cent or 30 per cent, it does not matter; the minister cannot tell the board what to do once the decision is made to sell off any of it. Think carefully about what you are doing.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill 1996 provides a clear way forward for Telstra to move into the 21st century. During the recent election campaign, the coalition was openly and continually stating that, if elected, it would sell a third of Telstra by way of a share float. On 2 March in Dunkley&mdash;my electorate&mdash;our campaign team even displayed newspaper style posters which spelt out the Liberal guarantee for Telstra: two&hyphen;thirds of Telstra will remain in public ownership; there will be no foreign control of Telstra; Australians will be able to buy shares in Telstra; cross&hyphen;subsidies for regional Australia will remain; there will be no timed local calls imposed on business or residential customers; and existing price caps will remain to ensure lower telephone prices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite many reports of the former Prime Minister's aching desire to sell Telstra, and episodes of pencil throwing, Labor said that the election was a referendum on the sale of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Telstra. From Labor's campaign advertising and continual letterboxing in my electorate promising that the world would end if Telstra were partially sold&mdash;the Armageddon theory&mdash;to their banners on election day, Labor clearly saw this as a key issue for the election. What occurred? Voters delivered the coalition a huge mandate for its program of practical reforms. Unlike Labor, we were not sneaky or deceptive about our plans for the future or any privatisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a bit like an old western: the election was about the good, the bad and the ugly. The good was the policy platform that the coalition offered to restore the prosperity of our nation and hope for Australians. The bad was the former government that had failed to listen to the electorate and had forgotten communities like Dunkley. The ugly was to come after the election, being the $8 billion black hole that the coalition and the Australian community only discovered after votes had been cast.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Voters indicated that they approved of the planned partial sale of Telstra and its accompanying establishment of the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia&mdash;which will be the subject of later legislation. Because the sale of Telstra was discussed in such detail at least 20 times during the campaign in a major way, there is no doubt that this was one of the first ranking issues of the election. The result suggests that the government has a huge mandate to implement its oft stated policy on Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Michael Gordon, the national political editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The voters made their choice . . . if a mandate means anything, it means that the Coalition has the political authority to proceed with the Telstra sale and the associated funding on an environment package that was universally well received . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It is the best set of environmental measures this nation and this parliament have ever seen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The benefits to Australia and to Dunkley in partially selling Telstra are manyfold, even when we come down to improving the older style analog telephone exchanges in communities like Seaford in Dunkley, where, on some Sunday nights, you actually have to wait until you get a chance to make a call. This is in metropolitan Melbourne. Because <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="581"> of the old exchange technology, you still have to queue up in areas like Kananook and Fortescue Avenues in Seaford just to make a phone call. Currently, only about two&hyphen;thirds of the exchanges are digitised. Under the government's plans for Telstra, upgrading of all telephone exchanges will occur two years earlier than would have been the case under Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the first time, both residential and business consumers will have access to a customer service guarantee&mdash;something they did not have before&mdash;not only from Telstra but also from Optus, Vodafone and others. This will no longer just be voluntary but part of law. Industry regulator Austel will set carrier performance standards and determine damages payable to consumers for breaches, up to a maximum of $3,000. Customers will be able to seek damages in the courts if the carriers fail to pay the damages voluntarily. This customer service guarantee will help to rapidly improve the standards of service of Telstra and the other carriers; second best will no longer be good enough for the telecommunications users in our country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are Labor's objections to this partial sale of Telstra? Labor sold off all&mdash;not just part&mdash;of Qantas, and half the Commonwealth Bank, even when they said they would not. It seems there has been a road to Damascus type of conversion of Labor to the cause of keeping Telstra in full public ownership. Why was this? Was it poll driven? Was it a means of talking about anything other than the Labor Party's own performance in government? Or was it that, with the sun setting on Labor and the rose&hyphen;coloured glasses being knocked off many of their members' faces, some recalled a principled but dimming light on the hill?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), who has proposed an amendment to this bill, spoke in this House yesterday of Labor's set of guiding principles on privatisation. He posed four basic questions to guide decisions about privatisation. Is the market already competitive? Can private capital play the role held by public capital? Will the taxpayers have to contribute to the capitalisation of the public enterprise? Are the market structure, its <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> technology and public interest considerations such that public capital can be withdrawn?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I encourage this sort of discussion about these sorts of policy issues and the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) alluded to some of them in his presentation. The member for Werriwa claimed that in the case of both Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank the answers to these questions were yes, yes, yes and yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of the partial privatisation of Telstra, the answers in the mind of the member for Werriwa are somehow different. I wonder about those people concerned about their basic banking accounts and about charges on their accounts with banking institutions. I wonder whether they would share some of the conclusions that the former government did and give such a resounding yes, yes, yes as the member for Werriwa suggested. In my view his answers were wrong but so were some of his questions. Whether or not a market is competitive already should not be the sole bar to changing its ownership structure. The key is whether Telstra will be a better corporation with a degree of market discipline that partial private ownership can provide. As Telstra's chief executive officer Mr Frank Blount said in his 1994&hyphen;95 annual report, talking about his staff:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As we become more commercial in our operations and outlook, we are asking our people to grow into new roles . . . A number of cultural and work practice changes are still required.</PARA>
<PARA>The chief executive officer was talking about the sorts of changes we are talking about, and they were happening already within the corporation. This issue about the proposed partial privatisation seems to resonate and accord with many of the things Telstra was already seeking to pursue in its own right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we can have one&hyphen;third or one&hyphen;half of Telstra's employees owning shares themselves, then that alone will impose an overnight cultural change on Telstra that will put all the management speak about cooperative working relationships into something which has a dollar value and a real meaning for its employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="582"> Private capital can live with concepts such as universal service obligations and purchas ing policies just as well as public capital can. The current provisions under section 287 of the Telecommunications Act for a universal service obligation are actually improved by the bill before us today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because the sale of Telstra is so important to our country, to our environment and to our future communications industry, I encourage members on the other side of the House to think of the future, to think about where we would like to be in the telecommunications world. There was some mention by the honourable member for Brisbane that the likes of Alcatel and other IT and T providers will somehow no longer be seen to be of strategic benefit and suitable enough to build alliances with Telstra. I find that amazing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With Telstra claiming, as its staff do, that they are running in a very commercial manner at the moment, I am sure those alliances and relationships that have been built up to date will be sustained. It is not as though some overnight change in ownership structure suddenly makes a good relationship a bad business relationship. I am not quite sure whether the honourable member for Brisbane is suggesting that the change and the injection of some new ideas and some new directors into a company that has already got those strategic alliances will lead to it being immediately ejected. I just cannot see that happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor says that the universal service obligations must be filled efficiently and as economically as practical. They say that unless that happens then the end of the world theory&mdash;the Armageddon result&mdash;will occur. But all this means is that Telstra must stay focused on the best way to deliver its services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Werriwa claimed Telstra is flush. With his former government having used Telstra as a `cash cow', forcing it to pay massive billion dollar dividends, there is little wonder people in my community do not have access to digital telephone exchanges, ISDN and the on&hyphen;line services that are available to many other areas within our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With Labor having left the coalition with an $8 billion budgetary black hole, we are actually proposing a measure which will <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> convert technological capital into environmental capital&mdash;a very worthwhile objective and one which I thought would have been encouraged by all sides of the House. That reflects the fact that the environment lost ground under Labor. The clearance of vegetation, land degradation, even this nation's history on endangered species, all went backwards under Labor. The injection of capital to try to resurrect and improve our natural systems and sustain their productive capacity into the future is long overdue. The coalition is approaching that task with some vigour and a comprehensive program that has a very logical method of funding&mdash;converting technological capital into environmental capital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor also ignores the widespread community acceptance of share ownership. You only have to look at the stampede for shares in Woolworths, the GIO, the SGIO in Western Australia and Qantas to know that Australians want to have a direct stake in these enterprises. Telstra is no different.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Concerning banking, the member for Werriwa claimed that there was no big, technological change that indicated to the public sector that it needed to keep a strategic asset in the market. Telstra will remain a great and vital Australian company with the government retaining a two&hyphen;thirds strategic stake. But, if we keep assets in public hands for no other reason than their perceived strategic value, we risk them underperforming over time. This only produces poor relative returns to the Australian taxpayer, impedes our competitiveness and leaves us all worse off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's partial sale of Telstra actually stacks up better against Labor's principles than have some of federal Labor's own privatisations. In fact, it is sad in a way that the previous government gave privatisation a bit of a bad name. The way it went about privatising assets after saying that it would not and the way it went about wilfully spending the proceeds from those privatisations on recurrent expenditure, it has given privatisation a very bad name.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, said on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> that it did not matter of its <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="583"> essence whether Telstra was in private or public ownership. As Labor knows, it is a bit isolated on this issue. The only remaining state Labor government, the one in New South Wales, is busy privatising, as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) pointed out yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the debate, both the Labor Party and the Democrats have tried to run the line that any staff cuts for Telstra would be disastrous. This subject came up at a public meeting in my electorate during the campaign. Some people in the audience attempted to attribute the reduction in staffing numbers at Telstra solely to the coalition's plans to partially privatise Telstra, but they neglected to mention that the staffing levels at Telstra had already gone down and had been going down for some time. Telstra is not a static corporation. Its changing role and activities were having an impact on its staffing structure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra's CEO, Mr Blount, said on 17 April that Telstra's plan to reduce its 26,000 administrative staff to 13,000 was not triggered by any looming partial privatisation but was the second phase of a business plan that he drew up when he began work at the company, a plan that he drew up under the former government and which it endorsed. These staffing reductions are not something new. It is quite mischievous of the opposition to say that future cuts in staffing numbers at Telstra are directly related to the coalition's plans. That is quite wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much of this reduction will be met through voluntary redundancies, natural attrition and transfer to operational areas. There is a Victorian experience which is worth drawing from and which shows that growth in the private sector takes up any losses in the public sector, so there is generally a net benefit in employment terms. Many of Telstra's skilled staff will be in demand as consultants in the fast growing multimedia sector anyway. Many new job opportunities exist for forward thinkers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the recent BZW Australia study stated, Telstra is valued at about $28 billion. Profits should grow at around $18 million a year until l998, the report says, but, without substantial cost reductions, there is doubt that Telstra will achieve its target. Under Labor, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Telstra's performance has not always been fantastic. A human resource consultant in my electorate was doing work for Telstra in its telemarketing division. Unfortunately, some of the business relationships that were part of that set of negotiations to provide trained staff to Telstra fell by the wayside. I am hopeful that those things will change in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first thing businesses and individuals think of is how much calls cost. The Bureau of Industry Economics, in its recent report on international performance indicators for telecommunications, says that between l989 and l994 price falls for what is called `the basket of national services' and for IDD calls were less than the international average. Only in the mobile phone call market did Australia do better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The natural heritage that will be funded from the partial privatisation of Telstra is very important to my electorate. Dunkley is a coastal electorate&mdash;we call it `Dunkley by the Bay'. The benefits that are available to it through the Natural Heritage Trust are quite significant. I have no intention of foreshadowing that legislation, but I reiterate the point that after 13 years of Labor government our nation has gone backwards on many key indicators of the environment's condition. It is long overdue for a government to make a significant investment in our future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a sense, the coalition's partial sale of Telstra will be as nourishing to the Australian communications sector as it will be to the overall fiscal health of the economy, as well as to the community redeveloping and renurturing its natural systems. These are initiatives for our future and for improving the natural and technological infrastructure so that we all have a better future to look forward to.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the last question is no. The answers to the first two questions are as follows.

It is important because Australia is more vulnerable than most Western economies on our external account.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This morning, I had an extremely constructive meeting with the Chief Minister of the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ACT and also with leaders of the business community in Canberra. Do you know what those leaders said to me? They said, `This is the first time there has been any serious dialogue between the business community of Canberra and the federal government since the Fraser government was in office.' Instead of adopting a negative attitude, they were concerned about ways and means in which there could be initiatives of the federal government and the territorial government to encourage more private sector investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I agreed to a number of proposals that were put to me by that group.

What action is the government taking to ensure that small business people can get on with the job of creating jobs and strengthening our economy?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Lindsay for her question. I have to say that there were many individual results that gave me immense pleasure on the night of 2 March, but few exceeded the pleasure of seeing an 11.2 per cent swing in the western suburbs of Sydney, which delivered the seat of Lindsay. It would appear that the spirit of being a good loser in an avalanche has apparently been lost on some members of the Australian Labor Party. The member for Lindsay won that seat convincingly; she won it fairly; she won it overwhelmingly. I think she will give very great credit to the people of Lindsay for years into the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Because there are a large number of small businesses in the electorate of Lindsay, it is not surprising that the honourable member's first question in this parliament should be about the future of small business in Australia. It is no secret that we place enormous store on the small business sector as a means of building the future strengths of the Australian economy. In the short time that the government has already been in office we have already announced a number of quite specific measures to benefit the small business community. If the Senate is willing to pass our industrial relations legislation, one of those issues which has caused more complaint from the small business community than any other issue over the last couple of years can be put behind us&mdash;that is, the unfair dismissal law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Just as environmentalists will be watching how the Senate votes on the Telstra legislation, the tens of thousands of men and women in small business around Australia will be watching how the Labor Party votes on the industrial relations legislation and, specifically, whether it is prepared to maintain in place an unfair dismissal regime which has literally destroyed thousands of jobs over the last two or three years. It will be a very interesting test of the bona fides of the concern of the Labor Party, the Australian Democrats and others about the role of small business in the Australian community. Are they going to say yes to fixing up the unfair dismissal law or are they going to say no? Are they going to slam the door shut on those thousands of Austral ians who cannot get a job in small business because of the intimidatory effect of the unfair dismissal law or are they going to say, `Let's have an unfair dismissal law that is fair to both sides'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The small business community and the job seekers of Australia will be watching very carefully to see what the Labor Party does on this particular issue. Are they for or against job opportunities in small business? I know that the electors of Lindsay will be watching, as will those in all the other electorates. I think there would be a lot of people in the electorate of Dobell who might be watching. The member for Dobell only just made it. The way you lot are going at present, I wouldn't sleep too easily.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have done a large number of things in a short period to assist the small business community. We have announced the setting up of the deregulation task force and we have announced that the Australian Bureau of Statistics will reduce the cost to small business of completing statistical returns by 20 per cent in one hit. The cost of producing those has been brought down by 20 per cent. There will be a national small business summit on 12 June. Introduction of legislation to reduce the provisional tax uplift factor from eight per cent to six per cent has already been authorised. We have not left that to the budget; we have already made a decision and the legislation to bring it about will be introduced into the parliament this session. We are going to introduce sunset clauses for new regulations and in due course we will be giving consideration to the commitments made regarding capital gains tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue more than anything else which is of concern to the small business community and, therefore, goes to the heart of the long&hyphen;term job opportunities of people in small business, is whether or not this parliament&mdash;the 38th Parliament of the Commonwealth&mdash;will focus on fixing Australia's arthritic industrial relations system. The small business community will judge the political parties in this parliament on that issue more than anything else. They know and the people of Lindsay know that those people who vote against a reform of our unfair dismissal <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="588"> reforms and those who vote to maintain the present industrial system are voting against the creation of job opportunities in the small business community of Australia.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the Treasurer seen recent reports calling for the government to slow down its program of deficit reductions? What are the consequences for small business, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> employment and interest rates of further delaying returning the budget to surplus?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="588" SPEAKER="Costello, Peter, MP" NAMEID="CT4" ELECTORATE="Higgins" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Treasurer" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unfortunately, I have seen reports urging the government to slow down the program of deficit reduction. They seem to be coming from the new shadow Treasurer, with all the fury that he can muster. On 24 April he said, `Labor in opposition does not resile for a moment from the position we adopted as a government that it is very desirable, other things being equal, for there to be a return to underlying fiscal balance as soon as possible.' In other words, they are saying, `Other things being equal, we are in favour of a balance. It is just that for 13 years they were all unequal. For 13 years nothing equalised enough for us to be able to fix the problem.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When he thought the budget should be returned to surplus, he said on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS> program, `We'd spread it out over a much longer period, depending on what the size of the task is going to be. We'd spread it out over a much longer period.' It reminded me of the book we used to read as children, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">We of the Never Never</EMPHASIS>. `We would spread it out over a much longer period.' But 13 years was not enough, 14 or 15 would be too much, and if you had another term of parliament that would probably get you into trouble as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Governor of the Reserve Bank has made perfectly clear, if the recovery has been in position for four to five years, when else are you going to get the budget back into balance and, if you do not get the budget back into balance in relation to an economic recovery, how exposed would the economy be in another downturn? That is, the legacy of debt, the build&hyphen;up of debt. As I pointed out yesterday, this debt was being built up all the time that Labor was flogging off assets and not repaying any debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I noticed that on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> program last night, the Leader of the Opposition was asked, `What's a con about a $7.9 billion underlying deficit?' He said, `No, the deficit is $4.9 billion, the headline rate.' But the fact is you said during the campaign that you stood by the Treasury figure, which was a surplus of $3.4 million, a $4.9 million deficit&mdash;a $8 billion of Beazley black hole. That <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="589"> is where it came from, that is how it arose, but you could have stopped it if you had before the election come clean on the accounts with the Australian people; yet you failed to do so. All of this was going on whilst Labor was selling off banks and airlines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the Opposition was discussing further privatisation on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> last night. In relation to a privatised Telstra, he said, `I know these things. I have been through more privatisations than anyone else.' Well, you have! We would be prepared to give credit where credit is due. You really are a great privatiser&mdash;a brilliant privatiser. It just so happens that you forgot your lines. After the election you became anti-privatisation rather than pro.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I noticed in one of the newspaper articles a Labor backbencher accusing Labor in opposition of political cross-dressing. You were a great privatiser. You do have a great record in relation to privatisation. You believe in privatisation. It is just that you cannot bring around the unions and the backbench in relation to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">May I make it clear that the aim to balance the budget is an aim to take pressure off interest rates. To the degree that this opposition will not support the government, it stands for increased pressure on interest rates and lower economic growth and it will deny people job opportunities. Nothing could be more important at this stage than putting in place a program which will balance the budget, which will have consequences&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us say a few things of substance about this. Land and water degradation are Australia's No. 1 environmental problem. This is the largest environmental package ever contemplated by a government in Australia and put before the people. It is very much more substantial and innovative than the one the then government put before the Australian people, and they were never able to explain how they were going to pay for it. It establishes the National Heritage Trust fund of Australia with a capital injection of $1 billion, much of which will be used for key capital works projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The national vegetation initiative is one of the projects and it will be to revegetate hundreds of thousands of degraded lands. The national land and water resources audit will measure once and for all the true extent and economic cost of land and water degradation. The Murray-Darling 2001 project will tackle the major environmental problems in the Murray-Darling Basin, so eloquently referred to by the Prime Minister yesterday, and is substantially larger than the proposition you put forward and did not indicate how you would pay for it.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me make a couple of other points. It needs to be recognised that farmers manage no less than 60 per cent of Australia's land. Therefore, they will play a critical role in implementing the package. The first principle is that farmers have to be in the black if they are to be truly green. In the end, the fact is that they do the bulk of the work and undertake the bulk of the expenditure.</PARA>

They do so not only to secure their future but to secure sustainable agriculture and to sustain a resource base for future generations. So there is a big community benefit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first challenge in all of this is to restore the economy through economic reform in areas that the Labor Party would not tackle. That is the first priority&mdash;restore the economic fortunes of the rural sector. It is the key to landcare because poor economic management has been the rural sector's greatest problem in recent years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Look at your performance during the 1980s so far as the farming sector was concerned. We had interest rates well over 20 per cent for years on end because of your very one dimensional approach to managing the economy. We had your utter failure to tackle meaningful industrial relations reform, which cost the farm sector a fortune. You gutted IEDs at the very time when they could have helped the rural sector prepare for the drought and the commodity price declines of the 1980s. You ripped them out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that we have to deal with what we have been left with&mdash;that is, a farm sector in bad shape because you managed the economy so badly for so long. You always resisted on&hyphen;farm landcare works because you were not prepared to recognise the community benefits of doing so. We do recognise the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="591"> community benefits. We will facilitate them. We will drive them. We will free them up. We will let them happen. Most of all, this expenditure will be encouraged through the introduction of a system of landcare tax rebates and credits&mdash;something that you would not tackle, even though I understand your then minister wanted you to&mdash;to enable farmers with low or negative incomes to continue spending on landcare.

<ANSWER PAGE="592" SPEAKER="Reith, Peter, MP" NAMEID="WI4" ELECTORATE="Flinders" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Industrial Relations" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I particularly welcome the question from the member for Capricornia. As members on this side will know, the member for Capricornia has in fact been a very active member of the trade union movement. He has been a member of the CFMEU, a union delegate with the CFMEU, and he has also been a member over the years of the AMWU, so I welcome his question on industrial relations. He brings a practical viewpoint to the issue, unlike the chardonnay trade unionists who sit on the other side.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the only good thing that could be said about it is that the member for <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Capricornia is not alone because the fact that he voted and was a candidate for the coalition parties in the last election just reflects that a lot of rank and file trade union members voted for the coalition in the last election. I want to say to those rank and file trade union members that we will stick to our policy, and our policy will be very good for the working people of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the particular matter which has created a lot of interest amongst trade union officials, the coalition's policy on paid rates was quite clear. We said that over time existing paid rates awards should become minimum rates awards after consultation between the relevant parties. The process of award simplification will not be a device to reduce wages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, the idea of converting paid rates awards to minimum awards is not new. In fact, the coalition's policy picked up the sort of approach that the commission itself had adopted during the 1980s, and we want to see that process continue as part of the broader set of reforms that we are proposing. Paid rates awards are anomalous; I do not think anybody would seriously contest that proposition. Obviously, over time, we want to see that awards should set minimum standards so that employers and employees are encouraged to negotiate agreements which particularly reflect the conditions in their respective businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the idea which some are touting that somehow paid rates are needed to set actual rates of pay really is mistaken. If you take the public sector, there is a paid rates award in the Australian Public Service, but in fact that paid rates award has not been changed since the early 1990s. In fact there is now a certified agreement superimposed over the paid rates award, and the paid rates award is about 15 per cent less than what people are getting today. So they are a feature of the system which really over recent years has been phased out. We obviously want to encourage that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our legislation, therefore, will implement the policy of paid rates awards by removing those aspects of the existing legislation which effectively discouraged the commission from doing what needs to be done in respect of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="593"> paid rates awards. I must say that we have had a number of consultations with public sector unions about this issue&mdash;with the CPSU, the AMWU, the ACTU and others&mdash;and, as a result of those consultations, we intend to make sure that the process for conversion will not be a proscriptive one on the commission. In our policy we said that this would happen over time; we are sticking to the letter and to the spirit of that policy commitment. We said it would be done by the commission. We think it is fair that the independent umpire should be in charge of this. We will make sure in our legislation that the guarantee we gave about people's pay will in fact be properly adhered to and implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I think it is a very fair deal. It is a reasonable deal. The exact process has been refined as a result of sensible consultations, and I think it will be one aspect of the policy which over time will produce real benefits. That is my finishing point, Mr Speaker.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason we are doing these things is that it gives people a chance of higher pay in the future. It is a pity that, even into the first fortnight of this new parliament, we are seeing the opposition actually regress from the policies they had going into the last election in respect of some parts of industrial relations. People like George Campbell are starting to dictate to the Leader of the Opposition about their industrial relations policy. They are contracting to their ACTU base and disregarding the views and the interests of the rank and file members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was not surprised that there was a very poor turnout in the so&hyphen;called lunchtime demonstration today. There was hardly anybody there. The reason is that the good sense of Australia's Public Service has come through; that is, they can see that what we are doing is in fact aimed at improving the system to ensure we have real benefits for average workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was no surprise to me that I should get a question from the honourable member for Capricornia, because one of the reasons he was elected is that ordinary working men and women and trade unionists know that it is this <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> side of the House that is going to give them a good deal.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

You <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="594"> did not suspend them. It is one thing for the government to say, `But we didn't use them,' but you did not suspend them.

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has always been taxable and it has always been taxed, my friend. Do you know why? That is because the Income Tax Assessment Act says that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> income is taxable. Think about it for a moment. An award payment is income, and therefore it is taxable&mdash;and it always has. So I would try to get on to a better point, if I were you.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former Treasurer said that he would be introducing legislation to give effect to an exemption. Of course, no such legislation was ever introduced. Therefore, because exemption legislation was never introduced, the allowances are and remain taxable. This government will not be introducing legislation to exempt certain kinds of payment from the Income Tax Assessment Act. That is the announcement that I made on 2 May 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not believe that there should be special legislation to exempt special payments from income tax. We think the ordinary requirements in relation to income tax should be observed, whether you happen to be a building worker, any other kind of worker or any other kind of employee. The rules that will apply in relation to these allowances are the same rules that apply to other industries and the same rules that apply to all employees. This is a decision that will ensure uniformity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me make it entirely clear that, as far as this government is concerned, there should be uniformity in relation to the Income Tax Assessment Act. We do not believe that there can be special deals done or special exemptions given, no matter how organised, no matter how militant the pressure group that seeks it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not believe as a matter of fairness that there can be special deals done in relation to exemptions from income tax, and we will not do them, nor will we follow the policy of the Labor Party which announced but never introduced that exemption.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first of those accounts is highlighted by an interview that he gave to AAP yesterday in which the former minister indicated that he had to step in to stop the sacking of the former managing director of AN on the basis that the board, in making that decision, would have had to meet at the end of January or early February this year at a time the former minister felt would be during a caretaker mode of government. Because we all know the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith is such a stickler for convention, we all know that he then said, `We can't do that because it would be inappropriate.' That is what he said. Indeed, in the interview he gave to AAP yesterday, he said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Speaker. They don't like it, do they? We all know that the substance of the former minister's concerns lies in the fact that he believes he was not&mdash;and he has been saying it&mdash;aware of the financial circumstances of AN when he met with the chairman in December last year. If that is the case, what the former minister, the now member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith, is asking us all to believe is that, when the chairman of AN approached him in December last year seeking approval to dismiss the managing director, this was such a humdrum everyday event that the former minister never thought to ask why. He never thought to ask, `Why would you want to dismiss this person? Is there a good and valid reason why you would do it?' All of us on this side of the House know the answer to that. Of course the minister did ask and the minister was informed. I will tell you now: he did not need to be reminded because we know the minister was well aware of the financial circumstances of AN and he was aware of them because of the existence of another letter from Mr Smorgon which came to me a few weeks ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="597"> In that letter Mr Smorgon outlined that the board rejected the 1995&hyphen;96 budget provided by AN's management and the five&hyphen;year corporate plan provided by AN's management on the basis that the advice for the budget and corporate plan was unrealistic. The former minister also knows that the board said not only were that budget and corporate plan unrealistic but also the advice coming from senior management was unreliable. He also would have known&mdash;according to the infor mation that I now have&mdash;that the Auditor&hyphen;General, through Arthur Andersen, who was representing the Auditor&hyphen;General, was made aware of these very serious discrepancies last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most damming evidence of all&mdash;I will table that letter for members to contemplate&mdash;that confirms that the former minister was aware of the serious financial woes of AN comes from his own mouth. It comes in his personal explanation made to this House last Thursday. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">I am proud of the fact that I appointed Mr Smorgon to tackle AN's financial woes . . . </EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Those were your words in the House last Thursday. Indeed, your words there confirm what we all know. I have discovered in the last few weeks that all through last year you have been aware of the very serious financial circumstances of AN because you appointed Mr Smorgon in February last year&mdash;in your words&mdash;to deal with the very serious financial woes of AN. You knew about the problems of AN back in February last year, as you knew of them in the middle of last year when the board rejected the budget of AN, as indeed you knew of them after 13 December last year when Mr Smorgon came and asked you to approve the dismissal of the managing director. You also knew because you received from your department in November last year a paper written by your department, with the assistance of the finance department, outlining the serious deficiencies within AN at the time. You sent that report back to your department and you sought it back from your department after you had returned it on 13 December last year. I think everybody in this House now knows the truth of the circumstances. The truth is that the former Minister for Transport, over the last few days, has been doing nothing more than attempting to hide the fact of his incompetence and of his cover&hyphen;up of his own shoddy political deals.</EMPHASIS></PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4G4">Mr DOWNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We do have to do a fair amount of work to repair Australia's relationship with New Zealand because of the damage done to that relationship by the man who is now, ironically, the shadow minister for foreign affairs. One of the extraordinary ironies I hear from my department is that the current member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith, who has scurried from the chamber during question time, is planning his first overseas visit to New Zealand. He is the man who, according to Don McKinnon, the foreign minister of New Zealand, reduced Australia's relationship with New Zealand to `an all&hyphen;time low'. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition remembers it only too well. Remember the embarrassment of it all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith is back just in time to be reminded of one or two things. Of course, what the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith did in the relationship with New Zealand, the House will recall, was rip up the air services agreement one week before implementation. I have done a little bit of research to find out what actually happened. The member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith sent a fax on 24 October 1994 to the New Zealand Minister for Transport, Mr Williamson, saying that the Australian government would not continue with the air services agreement. The fax was sent, members may be interested to know, on what was a public holiday in New Zealand&mdash;a good bit of planning there by the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="599"> member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith. I am told that at the same time a letter was faxed from the minister's office to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>. So it was nice for the New Zealand government to be able to read the story in the Australian newspapers the next day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is interesting is that the night before the fax was sent the head of the then minister's department had dinner with the New Zealand High Commissioner and in the course of that dinner the then secretary of the department never mentioned this plan to abrogate the air services agreement. Why? Because the secretary of the department&mdash;this is true, isn't it?&mdash;did not know it was going to happen. Something was cooked up that night, somewhere, probably in the office that I now inhabit, which used to be the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith's office&mdash;we have had to fumigate it fairly extensively&mdash;and we would like to know what was cooked up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The interesting thing is that when the New Zealand Minister for Transport came across to Australia later, on 10 November to be precise, the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith apologised to the New Zealand minister for his behaviour and what he had done. So there was a sense between Australia and New Zealand that at least the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith had admitted his culpability and bad behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Things, I am afraid, got worse because the next year the New Zealand minister arranged an appointment with the then Australian minister, the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith. The appointment was made for midday on 20 April 1995. So the New Zealand minister flew all the way to Canberra&mdash;he was going to Perth later on that night&mdash;and went to the New Zealand High Commission to prepare for the appointment at 12 o'clock. That time came and a message came from the then minister's office that no meeting could take place for 20 minutes. What happened in the end was the New Zealand minister waited for so long he simply had to give up on the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith, go to the airport and catch his plane. The New Zealand minister waited for an hour and a half for an appointment and never got one.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith ripped up the air services agreement without any consultation with his department. In the middle of the night some deal was cooked up with someone&mdash;we don't know who. He sends off a fax&mdash;</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8E4">Dr WOOLDRIDGE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for her question. I am aware of the issue she raises. The definition of `doctor shopping' is someone who sees more than 30 prescribing doctors in a 12&hyphen;month period. It is something we flagged in our policy before <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the election that we would be tough on, and the basic strategy that has been pursued up to date is to audit people who get more than 300 prescriptions a year or who see more than 30 doctors a year. That is 1,599 people in the first part of the audit. The results of the first phase of that audit have now been collated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What they show is the government can make an average saving of $5,000 every time it intervenes at an average cost to the government of $300, which in this first phase looks like a saving of $8 million. On that basis, an exact estimate of how much it is costing is very difficult, but if you include the additional medical, hospital and pharmaceutical costs it is somewhere between one per cent and 10 per cent of these programs, which is between $80 million and $800 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a particular concern as well with pharmaceuticals that some people visiting Australia may be hoarding pharmaceuticals&mdash;stockpiling them, having obtained them first under the safety net proposal. The Health Insurance Commission is investigating a number of such cases. If it believes there is a prima facie case of stockpiling, then it will be referred to the Federal Police.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On three occasions in the past 12 months, the Health Insurance Commission has prosecuted people under the Crimes Act and the National Health Act. We will continue to aggressively pursue this as well as looking at issues of medical overservicing. I think we have to look at the demand side as well, which is the patient side. Methods to tackle doctor shopping have to take into account privacy issues and issues of the doctor&hyphen;patient relationship, but it is vitally important if we are to make Medicare and the pharmaceutical benefits system sustainable in the long term.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4K4">Mr ANDERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will come to that interesting aspect of it in a moment. In essence, the answer is in two parts. Firstly, there are industrial relations reforms so that we can build a cooperative model instead of the confrontationalist one that you insisted on. Secondly, I have announced a task force whose job it will be to report to me in four months time&mdash;not another review, not another never&hyphen;ending report, but a task force&mdash;about how the institutional arrangements of the industry ought to be structured. We have the Meat Industry Council, the AMLC and the MRC at the moment. We have to integrate them better so that they drive the process of reform. Reform is desperately needed after your attempts over 13 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is the world's largest meat exporting country. It ought to send a shudder down the spine of everyone in this place and outside it that the New Zealanders and the Americans are now landing their product on our supermarket shelves at competitive rates. How are they able to do that? Maybe it is in large part because, as reports have shown, the Americans are able to process beef for as little as a third as we can and the New Zealanders for as little as a half.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You mob engaged in report after report after report. I said I am not going to do that, but one of them was the Industry Commission's, and this is the one I want to focus on briefly. It reckoned that some modest reforms&mdash;and I know the honourable member <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="602"> who asked the question will be interested in this&mdash;would deliver roughly $1 billion of savings for the meat industry. Here is the rub. You know what they said? Fifty per cent of them would be available for our hard&hyphen;pressed producers, that is, the farmers; 25 per cent would be available for the processors; and the remaining 25 per cent&mdash;who for?&mdash;for the workers. Some modest reform would benefit the workers. They would get pay increases of around 25 per cent, plus better employment opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From that I conclude that you magnificent champions of the working class over there and Bob Collins and Laurie Brereton when they were the respective ministers were saying that our industrial relations legislation would see that the problem can be fixed. That is why just five per cent of the productive capacity of the Australian meat industry has been reformed. While the New Zealanders and the Americans are creaming us, just five per cent of our capacity now operates on modern industrial relations practices, world-best practice. The pace of reform has been unbelievably slow. What you were doing, of course, was blocking the effective and efficient export of our commodities but facilitating the export of our jobs, you champions of the working classes.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When Labor came to power in 1983, older Australians could have been described as the forgotten generation. Over the next 13 years, successive Labor governments set about addressing the situation of the elderly in our community. Our aim in government was to build up a holistic system of support for the aged&mdash;one that covered transport, housing, respite care, services to the elderly in rural areas and the elderly in minority groups. Successive Labor governments in the 1980s recognised the problem and systematically set about implementing a long-term program of improving the situation of the aged in our community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As those opposite will now know, the program became formally known as the aged care reform strategy. I am very proud that my predecessor, the previous member for Jagajaga,  had very a large hand in implementing these reforms. The strategy had a number of aims: to change the balance of care away from nursing home care to support for people living in their own homes or in hostels; to develop a greater range of care choices for the frail aged; to improve standards of care in nursing homes as a result of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="605"> introduction of an upgraded program of monitoring; and to ensure that no pensioner in a nursing home would be required to pay more than 87.5 per cent of the standard pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is significant then that the minister responsible for aged care in this government, the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan), is prepared to canvass older people paying more for nursing home or hostel care. On the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program recently she also refused to rule out a death tax for older people to pay their nursing home bills. How does this possibly sit with the commitment to no new taxes? Does it mean no new taxes, except on the most vulnerable in our community&mdash;elderly people in nursing homes?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's strategy also emphasised the provision of higher benefits in hostel funding for those with higher care needs, support for carers and an action plan for dementia. Labor's commitment in this area is dramatically illustrated by our willingness to find the money to set about improving the position of older Australians. For example, in the area of home and community care, Labor's expenditure grew from $152 million in 1984-85 to $613 million in the last year or so. This represents a 163 per cent increase in real terms. That is the sort of need that Labor was left with to fill in 1983.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is fortunate for this government that the increases are there in the forward estimates to meet the growing needs of older Australians and their reasonable desire to remain independent in their own homes for as long as possible. But yesterday the Minister for Family Services refused to commit herself to this growth for home and community care, even though it is explicitly written in the coalition's election policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It needs to be acknowledged that when Labor came to power the Commonwealth was spending $0.8 billion on nursing homes. Under Labor this grew to $1.8 billion. In fact, under Labor, aged spending in total grew to $2.9 billion in 1995. In real terms that represents a 62 per cent increase, compared with an estimated increase of only 33 per cent in the target population over the same period.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In its pre-election promises, the government made many commitments to the people of Australia. Their promises were taken on trust. These promises, especially those to the elderly in our community, received further ratification by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now, one group in the community that is not going to be hurt is the most vulnerable. . . . we will protect the vulnerable and the needy.</PARA>
<PARA>These sentiments deserve the total support of this parliament. It would be carrying forward the work done in the area of aged care by previous Labor governments&mdash;governments that were guided by the basic principle that the way we respect and care for our aged and vulnerable is one of the yardsticks that measures how civilised, how decent, our community is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, this government is not in power for more than five minutes when it seems to be trying to duck away from these promises. Could it be that these fine promises were nothing more than electioneering rhetoric, aimed at conning the Australian public into believing that a Howard government really did care for people? If so, how do we explain the implications of the proposals gradually revealed by the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) over the last week? Even the manner of their public presentation has been a revelation. There was not a straightforward statement of intent, rather a succession of media releases, radio interviews and doorstops that gradually revealed this government's grand strategy: handing the bulk of aged and community care services back to the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> This plan is presented as a masterstroke, a means of cutting out duplication and waste. But is it simply a means of helping finance what has come to be known as a `Costello con'? In fact, this is simply a trick to make the states responsible for a very difficult and costly area of government. We can only hope that even Liberal state governments will not be part of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This area, I would suggest, is a true test of a government's commitment to its people&mdash;and this government fails that test at the first opportunity. What does handing these services <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="606"> back to the states mean? To understand the full implications of this, we need to appreciate the situation that existed before Labor governments began to take an increased responsibility for financing and regulating care for the aged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Giles report in 1984 makes a good starting point. I will not show you the pictures because I find them too gruesome myself. It paints a very graphic picture of the types of problems that used to occur under state supervision and which could easily occur again. There were great variations in the quality of care provided, in staff to resident ratios, and too much of the care itself was of an unacceptably low level. In fact, the Giles report talks of 20 nursing homes in the Melbourne area alone that were guilty of `inhumane conditions and treatment'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Melbourne was not alone in this. The Giles report says that substandard nursing homes were prevalent in every state. Failure to guarantee minimum national standards is a fundamental failure for a national government. It is not just we in the opposition that see these hand-back proposals&mdash;the son or daughter of Fightback&mdash;as an outrageous abdication of responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aged care providers, representing both community and commercial interests, have been very swift to register their disapproval and dismay at this prospect. The Australian Catholic Health Care Association, representing 200 nursing homes and 55 hospitals, said in a media release on 3 May this year said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Why would the minister want to transfer a national program from one jurisdiction to eight? It makes no sense.</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Nursing Homes and Extended Care Association, representing private enterprise and church, charity and community operators of residential care facilities, issued a media release on 2 May which was headed `Aged Care Providers Reject Transfer to States'. The association said they would `reject outright any plans by the federal Minister for Health and Family Services to transfer to the states responsibility for financial allocations and standards monitoring in aged care programs'. They went on to say:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Care of the frail aged in our community requires a national approach to ensure adequate funding . . . and the consistent delivery of quality care across the whole of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This task will be even more difficult to achieve if six state and two territory governments are involved.</PARA>
<PARA>Alarmingly, they further go on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Neither the Minister for Health and Family Services nor any representative of the Federal Government has discussed this proposal with aged care service providers.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister's proposals have provoked further criticism. Reverend Ray Cleary, Chief Executive Officer of the Melbourne City Mission, in opposing the transfer of aged care services to the states, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This pass the parcel game seems to be the force determining the question of responsibility for aged services. The focus ought to be on the client.</PARA>
<PARA>He asks:</PARA>

<PARA>Reverend Cleary then goes on to say:</PARA>

<PARA>He also points out that the general perception among aged care providers is that when the states were responsible for standards of care the monitoring was inadequate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What was the response of the Minister for Health and Family Services to this criticism? On 2 May, he conceded that his plan may see differing health standards across the country. In his view&mdash;I cannot imagine what this means as far as aged care goes&mdash;this will encourage `competitive  federalism'.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PG6">Ms MACKLIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That's right. I think the minister might have difficulty pointing out the advantages of competitive federalism to elderly people forced into substandard care as a result of his washing his hands of this responsibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The loss of federally regulated outcome standards is just the beginning of the problem. It is one thing to hand over responsibility to the states and receive undertakings from them in return. It is quite another to guarantee that the states will actually live up to these undertakings. In fact, establishing and maintaining adequate levels of accountability or performance from the states has been shown in other areas of government to be almost impossible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There can be no guarantee that the states will spend the money the Commonwealth allocates with these sorts of agreements. The minister, in one of his statements, says that he would tell the states, `This is what we expect in the way of outcomes; you go and meet them.' Even assuming that all the states would accept this interesting direction in good faith and with goodwill&mdash;a huge assumption given the problems we have had with Medicare agreements&mdash;the minister is grossly oversimplifying an incredibly difficult and complex task.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The crucial factors which are very difficult to measure in these areas, if they are not carried out properly, are quality of nursing home care, development of independent living skills and sensitive care of those suffering from dementia. These will be ignored if they are not able to be properly monitored nationally. When you find that the states have not spent the money you have allocated for aged care, what will you do? You will be able to do nothing, and elderly people will be left without any care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This process is likely to be exacerbated by certain concomitant moves to introduce market principles into community services and aged care&mdash;things such as compulsory competitive tendering, privatisation and user&hyphen;pays. We have seen a lot of it in Victoria. The latest idea in Victoria is to tender out Meals on Wheels. That is where you are <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> transferring aged care to&mdash;to people who have that sort of attitude to aged care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people of Australia are going to want to know where in your policies before the election did you reveal the plan for such a revolutionary change in health and community services. In fact, like other conservative governments before you, particularly ours in Victoria, having been elected on one agenda, the real agenda remains hidden.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the action of the shadow minister for family services, the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), in bringing this matter before the House today is reprehensible. It is reprehensible because she has brought this matter to the House on the basis of mere speculation, and all that does is needlessly unsettle and worry older Australians. It highlights Labor's cynicism, which is obviously not receding after the electorate's stinging rebuke to Labor on the 2 March election. It is also utterly breathtaking in its hypocrisy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had government for nine weeks. The shadow minister is basing her comments today on mere speculation. That is all it is. When her party was in government, it had 13 years to address the problems of aged care and the problems of older Australians and it did not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to the shadow minister that perhaps when she has been in the parliament a little longer she might come to understand her responsibilities in the wider community in working on mere speculation in order to get a scare campaign going in what is such a very important issue. She might also learn a little about the budget processes, and that speculation is rife. Perhaps the shadow minister should consult with some of her senior people who have been in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not propose to respond to the shadow minister's attempts to pre-empt our budget strategy except to say this: our government has never supported death taxes. It was your government who, prior to the last election, prior to the House rising last year, started talking about death taxes. We have never supported them. This government takes its election commitments very seriously. We will <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="608"> keep the faith of our commitments to provide assistance to those most in need. These commitments have been developed after extensive consultation with people in the aged care sector, with the providers and with the consumers. We have listened closely to what they have had to say.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> How ironic it is that this issue is being promoted by the Labor Party, the party of real broken promises. It is a great irony. I have just 15 minutes to summarise Labor's record of broken promises. And isn't it a lengthy one. It would take me hours in this chamber to summarise them. There is a litany of them. The previous policy documents of the Labor Party in relation to aged care are littered with broken promises. We remember, as do all pensioners in this country, that it was the Labor Party in the lead&hyphen;up to the 1993 election which promised to take all pensioners out of the tax system by 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, five days after the election&mdash;surprise, surprise!&mdash;Dr Neal Blewett, who was then a minister, said it was an error. Can you believe it? Labor reneged on its promise. It was no error. It was calculated and it was a cynical ploy to hoodwink the elderly voters in this country. This was the first of many broken promises. But, more importantly, it highlighted that the Labor Party had callously deceived elderly Australians simply to get their vote. Can you imagine the outcry if this government were to hide behind the excuse that its policy was an error?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Let us look at Labor's record of inaction on issues of importance to older Australians. Labor persistently refused, until last year, to abolish age discrimination in the federal Public Service despite years of pressure from the coalition and the general community. It took pre-election panic to get action from the then Labor government. Labor consistently failed to provide fair, just and equitable tax treatments for self&hyphen;funded retirees. Labor's promise to pay the l-a-w, law tax cuts in the form of matching government contributions to superannuation displayed an arrogant disregard for self&hyphen;funded retirees and those who will shortly retire, who have already provided for their future and no longer make superannuation contributions. Unlike the former <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Labor government, the coalition takes pre-election commitments very seriously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I specifically refer to, and suggest that the shadow minister opposite reads, the speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to ACOSS in October last year. Each and every member opposite should hang their heads in shame&mdash;there is hardly any of them in here; it obviously is not an important matter to them&mdash;at the inaction by the Keating and the Hawke governments on aged care issues. This government has inherited a legacy of serious neglect. Labor ignored the needs in the aged sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In stark contrast, the coalition is committed to delivering improvements in living standards in this area. Labor has simply been a party of glossy reports and inaction. In particular, Professor Gregory identified the cause of the problem of years of neglect, of cumbersome bureaucratic funding structures which actually discourage providers from making provision for places for people in nursing homes and in dementia specific facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was a major report into the funding requirements of nursing homes. When you look at the report you can see why the government tried to sneak out of it without paying it much attention. It is a damning indictment of the lack of care of Australia's frail and aged, and it was happening under the Labor government. They did not table this report in the House, let alone make it the subject of a ministerial statement. They did not want the opportunity to debate the matter. It was released from the office of the then Minister for Human Services and Health. We need look no further than that report to highlight the major problems confronting this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What became of the Gregory report under Carmen Lawrence? It joined all the other reports on the dusty shelves of her ministerial office, reports like the first Gregory report, the Keys report and the Macri report. You name it; Brian Howe and Carmen Lawrence shelved it usually after muttering pious platitudes about how important these reports were and how important it was to implement their recommendations.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="609">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the day we were left to rescue a residential aged care system in financial crisis, in a state of rock&hyphen;bottom morale and in a state of shock. Our government recognises that there is a need for substantial improvement in nursing home buildings in Australia. Because of Labor's rigid and incredibly bureaucratic funding formula and outcome standards there is a complete lack of any incentive to maintain good quality nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will now turn to the government's plan for the aged care sector and set out just one or two of them. The shadow minister mentioned the home and community care program. Let me say that we have a very strong commitment. We recognise the importance of older Australians being able to stay in their own homes for as long as they can. We recognise the many benefits of this. We have outlined in our policy document&mdash;which is available if the shadow minister wants to look at it, although I am sure she has already seen it&mdash;our commitment to the home and community care program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australians are living longer. In the new century, when those of the postwar baby boom generation reach the final years of their lives, the 2.5 per cent of Australians over the age of 80 in 1993 will have grown to about seven per cent in the year 2040. As a community we must look ahead to provide the infrastructure of residential and community based aged care which will be required by frail, older Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The community expects the government to put both short&hyphen; and long&hyphen;term strategic plans in place to address the ongoing needs of the community. However, Labor's legacy in the aged care system is straining to cope with the present demand, let alone building for the future. Labor's aged care creation is collapsing under its own weight. It cannot even begin to address the needs of the future. We will address this. We will make sure this is addressed. Change will not necessarily happen overnight, but this government is working to lay strong foundations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor has a nasty record of ad hoc management and a strong tendency to make decisions about older and frail Australians for political <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> expediency, not for good policy. What has amazed me as I have moved throughout the sector talking to industry and consumer groups in the few weeks since I was appointed minister is that the industry is suffering from a gross lack of action by the previous minister, the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence). She sat on her hands and the workload that I am now dealing with testifies to that. This is reflected in the quality of the administration of the member for Jagajaga's spiritual guru, the former ministerial boss, Brian Howe, and her predecessor in Jagajaga, Peter Staples, when ideology counted for far more than real and practical outcomes benefiting frail aged Australians in need of quality care.</PARA>

That is the one comment I have had made to me as I have gone around talking to people in the industry and to consumer groups. They say the former Labor government has failed to take any decisions for at least the last seven or eight years and this is one of the reasons why this sector is in such a mess. They just refused to address the issues. As I said before, they are so ideologically hidebound that they cannot consider the needs of elderly and frail Australians beyond their own ideological pursuits. That is a great tragedy for older Australians and for those who are frail and ill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The policies that this government took to the election were overwhelmingly endorsed by the electorate. They are very clear and very specific. I heard the shadow minister make reference to them and we have not changed those policies. Today the shadow minister has engaged in mere speculation, which is cynical and reprehensible. It is mere speculation. We laid out our policies very clearly before the election. They were thoroughly endorsed by the electorate, and that is why we are sitting here and you are sitting over there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unlike the Labor government, who could not provide leadership or action and could not make decisions, we will take action. All those <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="610"> beautiful, glossy reports lining the shelves in Carmen Lawrence's offices&mdash;some of which are very good and very acceptable&mdash;have been collecting dust for a very long time. The Labor Party had a serious problem in government. They spent a lot of money on consultants, had big staff numbers and big departments, but they have never been able to take their policy development&mdash;some of which we concede is good&mdash;from the point of policy development to implementing that policy for the good of Australia, and in this case for the good of frail and ageing Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will provide the leadership, take the action and make the decisions that will address the crisis which Labor's inaction has created. You are the guilty party. You broke election promises for the last 13 years. You broke them; not us. You made them; you broke them. They are there in black and white. I can bring the Labor Party's policies on older Australians into this House. You broke those policies. It is your record that is up for scrutiny. The electorate has scrutinised it, the electorate made a decision and you are out of government. You had the responsibility for 13 years and you did nothing.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> As the Minister for Family Services said, there is a lot of worry out there in the com munity. She claims that it is needless worry. She alleges that the Labor Party is in some way trying to unsettle and worry older Australians. I can tell the minister that a lot of elderly Australians are worried and unsettled. The reason they are going to stay unsettled between now and August is that the minister refuses to rule out means testing of nursing home benefits. Yesterday in this chamber the representative of the Minister for Social Security refused to rule out pensions falling below 25 per cent of average weekly earnings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next government speaker, the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl)&mdash;one of the better representatives of the National Party&mdash;could also make sure that the elderly people in his electorate will not be worried and unsettled if he gets an assurance, private or otherwise, from the minister and lets us in on the secret and tells us whether he can assure all elderly Australians that there will be no means testing of benefits paid to residents of nursing homes. He should also give us an assurance that pensions will not be allowed to fall below 25 per cent of average weekly earnings.</PARA>

<PARA>I can assure my constituent that the member for Jagajaga, myself and all Labor members of this House will be raising this issue every week and every day that the House sits until we get the assurance that the Howard government will not impose a means test on benefits provided to nursing home residents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I find most outrageous is that just over a year ago the current Minister for Health and Family Services, Dr Wooldridge, came into this chamber ranting and raving, claiming that he had a secret Finance document which would show that the then Labor government would introduce means testing of nursing home benefits. He demanded that the then Labor government rule the matter out. There was nothing then about it going to the ERC or waiting until budget night. Dr Wooldridge was in here day after day wanting us to rule the measure out. What did he do when Laurie Oakes asked him on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday </EMPHASIS>program to rule the measure out? He equivocated. Laurie Oakes put to him the question about nursing home benefits being means tested. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You said that that would attack the oldest, frailest, the most vulnerable Australians. You couldn't possibly accept that now, could you?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DR WOOLDRIDGE: Laurie, I am not going to rule anything in or out.</PARA>
<PARA>That was something that was going to attack the oldest, frailest and most vulnerable Aus <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> tralians that had to be ruled out on the spot a year ago when they were in opposition. The Liberal government is prepared to let this circulate in the community and cause a lot of worry and concern amongst elderly Australians when they could come into this House and ease those concerns with one statement. The reason we are going to keep raising this issue is that we know that the government is giving active consideration to this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second issue that is causing a great deal of concern out there in the community is the Howard Liberal government's plans to transfer responsibility for health from the Commonwealth to the states. That will have a severe impact on the services that are delivered to elderly Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth government currently provides funding for palliative care. If the federal government transfers responsibility for palliative care, as happened with immunisation, we will see the state governments try to save money and cut back where it cannot be seen and the programs will ultimately deliver a poorer service to elderly Australians. We saw the same thing happen with the dental program. The Whitlam government established the school dental scheme in 1973&mdash;a Commonwealth program that made sure that kids in schools had a chance to see a dentist. In 1981 the Fraser government handed back responsibility for the school dental scheme to the states. Within a very short period, by 1987, less than six years later, a very distinguished report found that there were widely varying standards of school dental care being provided to the kids in schools. Only 17 per cent of kids between the ages of 10 and 14 were getting to see a dentist at the government schools in Victoria, whereas 76 per cent of those kids were getting to see the dentist in South Australian schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So whenever you hand these programs back to the states you end up with different standards, different qualities of service being given to the children or elderly Australians throughout the country, and it just does not work. We need to make sure that the Commonwealth maintains proper national standards of health care and provides proper standards of service delivery for older Australians. The best way <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="612"> to do that is to make sure that the Commonwealth government continues to provide the funds and continues to make sure that it is responsible if people are not getting the services they need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make this point to the Minister for Family Services: if she is worried about the number of Australians who are writing to her regarding the possibility of means testing nursing home benefits, then she should speak to the Prime Minister or the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and get their approval to rule out the measure. They should let us know that there will be no imposition of a means test on nursing home benefits. At the moment elderly Australians pay 85 per cent of their pension if they are in a nursing home, and of course they are sometimes charged additional amounts for pharmaceuticals and for other services provided to them. Often it means that nursing home residents on very modest means find it difficult to make ends meet. Often their families have to make sacrifices to ensure that they have a proper life while living in that nursing home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the government to be considering the imposition of a means test on nursing home benefits is something that will cause a great deal of concern and worry amongst such elderly Australians as the constituent whose letter I have read out this afternoon. It is good to see that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) is in the chamber at the moment as he also has the responsibility for social security. We would like to see him, the next time he approaches this dispatch box, giving all pensioners throughout Australia the assurance that the basic pension will not fall below 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. When he was a backbencher in the Fraser&hyphen;Howard government, pensions fell from 25 per cent of average weekly earnings to only 21 per cent of average weekly earnings. We will make sure that, if this government tries to let pensions fall below that 25 per cent benchmark, we will hold them responsible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More importantly, elderly Australians right throughout the country will hold them responsible. If you means test nursing home benefits you will pay the price at the next election. If <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> you let pensions fall below 25 per cent of average weekly earnings you will pay the price as senior Australians vote against the Liberal Party at the next election.</PARA></SPEECH>

She did not mention one election promise that we have failed to honour&mdash;not one. Why didn't she tell us? Because it is not possible. Doesn't the member for Jagajaga know that this is 8 May? The election was only held on 2 March. This parliament hasn't even sat for two weeks. Give us a bit of a go, kid. Crikey! Come back in three years and, if we have not delivered, then you can move this MPI and tell us that we have refused to honour our election promises. It is ridiculous for the member to come in here today and say to a parliament that has not sat for even two weeks, `Oh, you are naughty boys and girls over there; you haven't honoured your election promises.' Give us time, and you will see something that you have never seen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might say that probably the member for Jagajaga has worked for too long with Brian Howe and Peter Staples. She said that when Labor came into office in 1983 they set out to provide transport, housing and respite care for the elderly. I have news for her and all the others on the opposition side. After 13 years of failed Labor mismanagement, there is still a need for transport for the aged, there is still a need for housing and, when you talk about respite care, unless you are living in cloud&hyphen;cuckoo&hyphen;land or in some&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AE4">Mr NEHL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Or perhaps in some specialised cities, or in some marginal Labor electorate, there is still a need. We know how they allocated the money over the last 13 years; in fact, my electorate of Cowper is a good case study. My colleagues the new National Party members for Richmond (Mr Anthony) and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="613"> Page (Mr Causley) have benefited from winning those two formerly marginal Labor seats because, with Labor's pork&hyphen;barrelling, they got lots.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The then marginal seat of Cowper&mdash;which is safe for democracy now&mdash;is a good case study as to how Labor neglected so many parts of Australia. Right now, in 1996&mdash;bearing in mind, of course, that the formula for nursing home beds and hostel places is 40 nursing home beds and 50 hostel places for every 1,000 members of the population over the age of 70&mdash;in Coffs Harbour we have a shortfall of 62 nursing home beds and 107 hostel places. Shame on the former minister for health, shame on Neal Blewett and all of those who failed to do what they should have done in equity, honesty and justice!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Nambucca Valley we are short nine nursing home beds and 17 hostel places. In the Bellinger Valley, we are short 17 nursing home beds and 24 hostel places. In Kempsey and the Macleay, we are short 14 nursing home beds and 19 hostel places; that is, 102 nursing home beds are needed right now according to the former government's formula, and that is just in my electorate. Added to that are 167 hostel places that have been restricted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Jagajaga should hang her head in shame about the attitudes and activities of both opposition speakers over the suggestion that there should be some sort of death tax. Right through this election campaign&mdash;and right through the 1993 election campaign and the ones before that&mdash;the members now sitting on the opposition benches perverted the truth. They did not give the correct facts about our policies; nor did they say much about their own. They never really campaigned on what policies they had; all they did was attack us, and they did it in a very deceitful manner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are still doing it. Do they not know that the election is over? They should settle down and get on with the job of being in opposition instead of still campaigning for the election. They are still scaremongering. I say again to the member for Jagajaga: shame, you have to give it up. The only concrete statement you made in the whole 15 minutes you <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> had was some reference to the Giles report of 1984. I know the Giles report, too. I have seen the photographs. Was she seriously suggesting that it is still going after 13 years? If that is the case, that was 13 years of their government. Why did they not tell us what policy matters we have refused to honour? Because they had no basis on which to stand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have spoken about proposals being gradually revealed. I take this opportunity to ask&mdash;rhetorically, of course&mdash;the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) what proposals she has put before this House for change. There are none. The member for Jagajaga said, `This plan is presented as a masterpiece.' What plan? There is no plan. This is obviously the product of some sort of nocturnal fantasies. The shortcomings she listed in aged care are there today. That is a result of 13 years of failed Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The dementia problem and the need for respite care have also been mentioned. I put a question on notice in the last parliament to the former minister requesting the details and the information on the number of nursing home beds, the number of hostel places and the number of CACPs for every electorate in this country, together with an indication of the population aged 70 and over. I wanted to reveal the rorting in the allocation of public resources to Labor seats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Immediately the election was over, I put that question on notice again. I know that I will get the information. It will provide a blueprint to show where the shortfalls are and where we will have to take remedial action to help people catch up. Much more than that, it will pinpoint Labor's misuse and mismanagement of taxpayers' money and public resources to try to bolster their own electoral chances. I look forward to getting that result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even though the MPI seemed to dwell on aged care accommodation, there were other things as well. I remind the House that in his 1989 budget speech the then Prime Minister, Paul Keating, announced:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From 1995 all age and service pensioners will be totally removed from the tax system. In other words, all age and service pensioners will be subject only to the social security income test&mdash;they will not have to pay tax. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="614"> </PARA>
<PARA>Pigs might fly! They really might. That was said in 1989 but it was not going to come in until 1995. They were just promises on the never&hyphen;never&mdash;and of course they never, never came true. He was consistent. In 1993 the then Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labor's commitment to removing all age pensioners from the tax system by 1995 will benefit pensioners paid at the part rate as well as providing some assistance to retirees with incomes beyond the pension cut out point.</PARA>
<PARA>That was in the 1993 ALP policy document for older Australians. Those older Australians are still waiting. Thank goodness they will not have to wait much longer because all of those people have gone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also make the point about dental care. The member for Dobell (Mr Lee) got carried away. He forgot the subject of the debate, which is elderly Australians, and he started flooding us with statistics about dental care for children. I would like him to know that there is a two&hyphen;year waiting period for elderly Australians to get dentures&mdash;in some places it is four years&mdash;because of a lack of funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my area, in Coffs Harbour, there are 23 people&mdash;12 women and 11 men&mdash;who need urgent placement for dementia. I do not have time to tell you some of the sad circumstances of these people. There was a case where a woman with dementia was found trying to feed her dead husband breakfast&mdash;he had died overnight. There is the violent and aggressive man who is a deaf mute and who has a deaf mute wife, and so on. This is happening all over Australia. We need more respite care. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>This bill is a machinery financing measure to enable certain defence expenditures to be met from the loan fund rather than the consolidated revenue fund and to supplement the moneys available to the consolidated revenue fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Legally, expenditure from the consolidated revenue fund cannot exceed the moneys available to that fund. Successive governments have adopted the practice of introducing a loan bill to authorise the issue of moneys from the loan fund to meet expenditures that have been appropriated by the parliament, but for which insufficient funds are available in the consolidated revenue fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of this bill is to make provision for the financing of the prospective deficit in the consolidated revenue fund. The difference between the estimated budget and consolidated revenue fund outcomes, estimated at about $2.8 billion in 1995&hyphen;96, arises because appropriations from the CRF include various items which are functionally classified as financing transactions rather than outlays, and thus do not affect the budget outcome. These items include superannuation payments made by the Commonwealth on behalf of public trading enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill provides authority for the loan fund to meet defence expenditures incurred in 1996&hyphen;97 after the passage of the bill that would otherwise have been met from the consolidated revenue fund and, if necessary, to reimburse the consolidated revenue fund for certain non&hyphen;defence expenditures. The bill also provides the authority to raise loans to cover these payments from the loan fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Except for loan raising expenses, which are currently estimated at $0.2 million for 1996&hyphen;97, the bill does not authorise expenditures additional to those already approved by, or currently before, the parliament. I emphasise that the bill does not in any way impinge on the prerogative of the parliament to appropriate moneys, but simply provides the means to finance expenditures previously approved and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> appropriated by the parliament.

Supply Bill (No. 1) provides for interim authority for proposed expenditure on the ordinary annual services of government until about the end of November when it is anticipated that the budget legislation will have been passed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Reflecting the routine and interim nature of supply bills, as well as established practice for this type of legislation, provision has been made at the broad subdivision level rather than at detailed appropriation item level, which is the convention for the budget appropriation bills, except for items of new policy. Supply Bill (No. 1) must be passed in this session to ensure funding is available to all agencies from 1 July 1996, thereby ensuring the continuity of program delivery.</PARA>

<PARA>This bill authorises the Commonwealth to formulate and enter into a new Commonwealth&hyphen;state housing agreement, CSHA, with the states and territories for the purpose of providing housing assistance so that people may achieve housing that is affordable, secure and appropriate to their needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="617"> Through this bill, the government is demonstrating its stated commitment to the Commonwealth&hyphen;state housing agreement, known as CSHA, as an important instrument in guiding national housing policy. We also wish to signal clearly our commitment to a process for further reform of the Common wealth&hyphen;state roles and responsibilities in the housing area. The government is keen to implement longer term reforms as soon as possible to build on improvements in efficiency and effectiveness of government housing assistance commenced in the new CSHA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government believes that housing is not simply about bricks and mortar. As a policy goal, we are interested in providing people with a greater choice in housing which is appropriate to their needs. We will be seeking to offer low income Australians a real choice between different forms of assistance and different providers of assistance. In achieving our aims, we will encourage private sector involvement in the supply of affordable rental housing for people on low incomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Continuing changes in lifestyle, household and family structures and demographic shifts in Australia call for innovative housing responses. Such changes set a challenging agenda for housing reform. In tackling the agenda for housing reform, it is necessary to take a national, strategic approach to meeting the future housing needs of Australians in partnership with state, territory and local governments and the private sector. The intention of the new CSHA is to enable the states and territories to get on with the job of delivering quality housing programs and to enable the Commonwealth to clearly monitor performance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a direction which is strongly supported by the Council of Australian Governments, known as COAG, and its micro-economic reform agenda. COAG has agreed that the `overriding objective' of reform of Commonwealth&hyphen;state roles and responsibilities should be to `improve outcomes for clients and value for money to taxpayers'. To this end, COAG has endorsed the need for a clearer delineation of the roles and responsibilities for housing provision and has noted that significant progress has been made with respect to these reforms in the housing area. Indeed, the agreement enabled by this legislation will lead the way in measuring the effectiveness and efficiency of government programs by rigorously measuring program outcomes. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me now turn to some of the key features of the new agreement being negotiated. It is intended that the next Commonwealth&hyphen;state housing agreement will operate from 1 July 1996 and will continue to be targeted to meet the needs of people who are most at risk of housing related poverty. It will be an interim agreement for up to three years aimed at achieving a number of fundamental reforms. As such, it will provide a basis for further significant longer term reform to achieve even greater improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of government housing assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The agreement will be funded by a special appropriation in 1996-97 of approximately $1,068 million. Funding for subsequent years will be determined as part of the commonwealth budgetary process and in light of progress in implementing longer term reforms and the report of the National Commission of Audit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new CSHA will acknowledge that the states and territories will be responsible for managing both the delivery of services and the assets and resources associated with service delivery. It will also offer states and territories greater flexibility in the provision of housing assistance and make them better able to exercise a broader range of options in ensuring a target level of housing stock. Ultimately, this will provide for greater housing choice, better-performing housing assistance programs and a greater focus on the quality of the housing assistance products provided to the consumer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is intended that the new CSHA will set out a number of broad principles in relation to the rights and responsibilities of consumers, and will address consumer expectations about consultation in relation to planning and service delivery. It is the government's intention to encourage the development by states and territories of codes of practice, in line with agreed national guidelines, which will set out in a clear and consistent manner the respective rights and responsibilities of service providers and consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While conferring increased flexibility on the states, the new agreement will also acknowledge that the Commonwealth has strategic <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="618"> national policy interests in relation to housing assistance. It will be the Commonwealth's responsibility to ensure that the agreement is part of a coherent housing policy which is supported by, and responsive to, the Commonwealth government's overall policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth's primary roles will be to specify the national housing objectives of the Commonwealth government and to evaluate the performance and outcomes achieved by states and territories which are to be funded under the new CSHA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is intended that the new CSHA will introduce nationally agreed measures of performance in relation to the achievement of consumer outcomes and administrative efficiency outcomes. States will be required under the agreement to report annually on their performance against key performance measures, thus providing an unprecedented level of accountability and transparency in housing operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to turn now to an overview of the legislation before us today. The Housing Assistance Bill provides a new framework for the provision of housing assistance by enabling the Commonwealth to enter into common form agreements with states and territories for the purposes of providing housing assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill is based on two basic premises:</PARA>
<PARA>&bull;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> that the Australian community holds housing and shelter to be a fundamental human need; and</PARA>
<PARA>&bull;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> that the majority of Australians are able to secure housing of an appropriate standard within their means.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is based on the principle that all Australians, regardless of their economic or social status, have the right to affordable, secure and appropriate housing. This government is concerned with building an Australia that is fair, that offers all its citizens opportunities to prosper, to enjoy fulfilling lives, to participate in their communities&mdash;in short, to exercise the rights of citizens and to fulfil the responsibilities which go with those rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, it must also be borne in mind that a significant number of Australians do not have the means to secure adequate housing or <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to exercise a choice in their accommodation. Nor is affordability the only barrier to achieving an appropriate standard of secure and affordable housing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People who experience, or who are at risk of, housing related poverty are more likely to experience economic and social disadvantage. They are also more likely to experience discrimination in their efforts to obtain housing and to experience adverse effects of inadequate or inappropriate housing. These include adverse effects on health, employment prospects, quality of life and life opportunities. Discrimination in housing markets affects many in the Australian community, in particular, Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders, women, single parents and their children, young people, people with a disability, people with a mental illness, people from non-English speaking backgrounds and people who are homeless.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill acknowledges that the Commonwealth should work in cooperation with the states and territories to assist people to access appropriate and affordable housing stock in accordance with their needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also acknowledges that the Commonwealth and the states and territories should work cooperatively with local government, in view of its regulatory and other functions, as well as with non&hyphen;government providers of housing assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The preamble to the bill also highlights the importance of encouraging private sector involvement in the provision of appropriate and affordable housing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In giving effect to these intentions, housing assistance funded under this legislation should be planned and delivered so as to take full account of the range of factors which contribute to the quality of life of the people receiving assistance, including the liveability of communities, the promotion of opportunity and choice, and respect for the dignity and self-esteem of people receiving assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation also includes an authority to make payments for research, development, demonstration and evaluation activities in relation to housing. The bill enables these <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="619"> payments to be made to organisations which possess relevant expertise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth government is committed to improving housing access for people on low incomes and to working with states and territories through a new Commonwealth&hyphen;state housing agreement that is authorised by the bill. Public housing and other forms of housing assistance provided under current arrangements meet real needs. They contribute to a fairer society by addressing a basic human need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reforms embodied in the new interim agreement will significantly enhance our public housing effort and position the Commonwealth, with the states and territories, to perform even better in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr MILES</EMPHASIS> (Braddon&mdash;Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (4.53 p.m.)&mdash;I move:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The Housing Loans Insurance Corporation (Transfer of Assets and Abolition) Bill 1996 will provide legislative authority for measures required to give effect to a substantial restructuring of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation. It will also provide for the abolition of related legislation, namely, the Housing Loans Insurance Act 1965 and the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation (Sale of Assets and Abolition) Act 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed restructure is the same as that envisaged by the previous government. As such, the bill that I am now presenting is virtually identical to one which was introduced by the former government late last year and passed by the House of Representatives on 24 October 1995. That bill, however, was <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not considered by the Senate prior to the federal election and therefore lapsed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Housing Loans Insurance Corporation was established as a statutory authority just over 30 years ago to meet a structural deficiency in the highly regulated financial environment which existed at that time. Its primary charter was to help low income earners with small deposits to obtain housing finance by insuring lenders against the costs of mortgage defaults.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the establishment of the corporation, a number of private mortgage insurers have entered the market with the result that there is no longer any justification for retaining the corporation in public ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A sale of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation was first attempted by the then coalition government in 1979, but processes were terminated by the incoming Labor government in 1983. Two further attempts at a sale were made by the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following the most recent sale attempt, financial advisers to the task force on asset sales, Baring Bros Burrows and Co. Ltd, were commissioned to undertake a review of the sale process and the corporation's position in the market. The review concluded, among other things, that the corporation enjoyed a number of advantages over its private sector competitors arising from its statutory authority status, including the guarantee of its liabilities, and from the fact that it is not subject to the supervision of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As these benefits, which effectively placed the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation on a different basis to its competitors, would not be available to any potential purchasers, it was difficult for them to gauge the true commercial worth of the corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="620"> The legislation I am now introducing is intended to address these concerns. It will, in particular, facilitate the re&hyphen;establishment of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation as a company incorporated under the Corporations Law and subject to the regulatory requirements of the ISC, as well as those of the states and territories. The new company will be fully capitalised in line with the require ments of the ISC, drawing on part of the present capital and reserves of the corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The existing Commonwealth guarantee will be removed as far as borrowings by the new company are concerned. However, the Commonwealth guarantee for non&hyphen;borrowing liabilities will be retained, at least for the present, to minimise any uncertainty in the mortgage insurance industry that might arise as a consequence of the restructuring of the corporation, given its prominent position in the market. Furthermore, to enable the company to attain the minimum credit rating required for mortgage insurers by state legislation, it would, in the absence of this guarantee, be necessary for the Commonwealth to commit significant additional capital resources to the new company, over and above what is already proposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In setting a target rate of return for the new company, nevertheless, account will be taken of any advantage the retention of the guarantee may accord it. With the removal of the guarantee on borrowing, there is no longer a need for a specific legislative provision pertaining to any government guarantees as the Treasurer has the powers under the constitution to guarantee liabilities of a non&hyphen;borrowing nature.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Housing Loans Insurance Corporation will cease writing business on the day before the new company comes into operation. The insurance policies of the corporation entered into prior to and including that date, which are referred to as the `old book', will become the direct responsibility of the Commonwealth. In exchange for accepting these liabilities, the Commonwealth will receive the balance of the corporation's capital and reserves. It is estimated that the level of funds to be transferred to consolidated revenue will be in excess of $100 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The `new' Housing Loans Insurance Corporation, expected to be known as HLIC Ltd, will be contracted by the Commonwealth to administer the unexpired portion of all insurance obligations contained in the `old book'. Funds will be set aside by the Commonwealth in a special account to be established by the new company and will be replenished as and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> when necessary to meet claims against these insurance contracts. Separation of the `old book' will, among other things, enable the new company's performance to be judged independently of the corporation's previous operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill currently before the House is designed to assist in giving effect to the arrangements that I have just outlined. It includes the following:</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> provision to the Treasurer of the necessary powers to direct the transfer of assets and liabilities in whatever way is considered appropriate to give effect to the abovementioned objectives;</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> authority for the Treasurer to enter into any agreement with the new company which would cover the terms under which existing insurance contracts would be managed, as well as the means by which payments for claims arising from these contracts could be made. The latter includes a standing appropriation for the required funding;</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the transfer of staff of the corporation to the new company, as well as the transfer of all current rights enjoyed by those staff to such matters as long service leave, superannuation, maternity leave and Comcare. It is not intended that the interests of the staff should in any way be adversely affected by this corporatisation exercise; and</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> finally, the winding up of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation and the repeal of all relevant legislation relating to the corporation. As part of the winding&hyphen;up exercise, a final report and detailed financial statements as at the date of cessation of the corporation's activities will be prepared by the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation. After being audited by the Audit Office, they will be tabled in the parliament in due course.</PARA>
<PARA>I conclude by noting that this legislation will assist in maintaining an efficient, competitive and diverse mortgage insurance market. This in turn will assist many Australians to achieve the goal of home ownership. I present the explanatory memorandum which contains more detailed explanations of the provisions of the bill. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA>

Beyond the benefits to the Australian public of a more efficient communications sector, reductions in public debt and the proceeds of the partial sale of Telstra, enabling a significant reinvestment in the restoration of Australia's natural systems, the bill provides for improved customer guarantees that will ensure all carriers are more responsive to Dunkley constituents. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(5.03 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I begin my contribution to this very important debate on the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill by painting for members an interesting picture. It is early 1995. The venue is Liberal Party headquarters. Present is the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), along with the member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer), Mr Andrew Robb and a number of key Liberal Party campaign strategists.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Bennelong is looking a little nervous as he contemplates the prospect of losing another unlosable election. He is also looking a little frustrated. How can he <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ensure an election victory but at the same time pursue his ideologically driven privatisation agenda? He shares his concerns with those present. `I have an idea,' an excited Liberal strategist exclaims. `What has been our most successful scare campaign?' asks the same adviser. `Foreign debt, of course,' the member for Bennelong responds very quickly. `It has also been our best in terms of distorting the facts,' Andrew Robb proudly adds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">`Well,' says the adviser, `we'll say that all the proceeds of privatisation will be used to retire debt. They'll think that is a good idea.' `That is a great idea,' says Andrew Robb. `It is not enough,' responds John Howard. `If we are going to foreshadow our intentions before the election, particularly with respect to Telstra, we need more.' `We won't support the flogging of Telstra in any case,' booms the member for Farrer, `We will never get it through in the country before the election.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">`Hang on. I think I have the answer for both of you,' interrupts another adviser, sensing that a major confrontation is imminent. `We'll steal the government's environment policy but bind its funding to the sale of Telstra and within the policy we will pay particular attention to issues within Tim's electorate, like the Murray.' The member for Farrer's silence is deafening but you can hear the wheels turning over as he contemplates his place in history. `Isn't the whole thing blatant blackmail?' asks the member for Bennelong. `I'd call it smart politics,' Andrew Robb pipes in. `It is pretty tricky,' adds the member for Farrer, with a smile.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But still contemplating his own place in history, John Howard decides it is all still a little risky. `We'll just sell one-third and see what happens after the election,' he smugly announces. `We'll never sell the shares,' warns a senior economic adviser present. `People will not invest in any organisation in which ministers of the Crown have the ability to influence management decisions. Investors are not concerned about community service obligations. They simply want good returns.' `Look,' John Howard angrily interrupts, `we are going to do it. We'll worry about the details later.'</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="622">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">`But what about community service obligations?' asks Tim Fischer. `The annual cost of providing a telephone service in some homes in my electorate is more than $1,500. Investors in a potential float won't wear those sorts of cross&hyphen;subsidies.' `We'll worry about that after the election as well,' responds a reassuring Mr Howard.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8K6">Mr FITZGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The member for Farrer and 18 million Australians are still waiting. Of course, I am not aware that any such conversation or meeting  actually took place. But I believe it accurately reflects the process which led to the development of this disgraceful bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is obvious that the partial sale of Telstra is the government's soft option vote&hyphen;saving measure. In my first speech in this place, I devoted much of my time to issues facing rural and regional Australia. The member for Lyons (Mr Adams) and I are the only members in this place capable of defending rural Australia. All the members on the other side of the House have been told to take their medicine quietly. The National Party is once again selling out its so-called national constituency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite obvious that the government's real agenda is to sell all of Telstra. But what is the point in selling only one-third of Telstra? There exists no logical explanation for the partial sale other than the fact that it makes the proposal more palatable in the electorate. As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) pointed out in the House this morning, if the sale is good policy, then why not sell the lot? The one-third sell off of Telstra will not deliver improved telecommunications services, but it will kill off rural and regional Australia. A privatised Telstra will not cross&hyphen;subsidise the roll&hyphen;out of cable to rural areas, price caps will inevitably go and gone will be the days of untimed local calls. In fact, the expensive&hyphen;to&hyphen;service and low return areas of Australia will find themselves the poor cousins of their city counterparts.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Retirees in my electorate, such as John and Joan Case living in Singleton and Reg Nilon of Muswellbrook, could be facing bills of up to $1,600 annually for the benefit of having a telephone in their home. Lord knows what their total bill will amount to once call charges, including those for timed local calls, are added. Privatisation of Telstra will kill the already vulnerable rural and regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the honourable member for Barton (Mr McClelland) pointed out in his most impressive speech earlier today, rural dwellers will not be able to afford to access the information services available to those living in the nation's cities. Children will be disadvantaged in terms of education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me paint another picture for the House. Take, for example, a small regional export business which relies on interstate, international and local contact with suppliers and consumers by regular phone, fax, e-mail and electronic ordering. What happens when communication costs increase? People are sacked and, of course, that will be a bit easier under the new government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With fewer people to process, the orders decline. With fewer products to export, fewer customers are interested in buying and exports take a dive. We know that regions are our hot spots and, increasingly in the next century, they will provide the greatest opportunities for economic growth. Prohibitively expensive communication costs will curtail this growth. We will cut away the best lifeline we have to economic and social betterment. We are giving people more reasons to leave rural Australia and migrate to our already overcrowded cities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should be encouraging people to live in our regional centres, not forcing them away by effectively restricting basic services&mdash;and services do not come any more basic than telephone services. Elderly people in particular rely almost entirely on telephone services to communicate with their friends and their relatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a bad time to be selling off a piece of strategic public infrastructure that is set to grow exponentially over the next decade. From a purchaser's perspective, it is probably <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="623"> a great time, but from an owner's perspective it is definitely selling when the market is weak. It is a buyer's market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In many ways it can be compared to the Swiss selling off the patent for digital technology, except our northern friends can be excused as they did not know that digital technology was to become the new benchmark for timekeeping. In our case, the Australian government knows the potential value of the technology Telstra is going to provide to Australia. A sale now will be robbing the nation of its entitlement to be a first&hyphen;class world competitor. The sale of Telstra will be robbing Australian people of the chance to gain a wealth of information and a new level of global education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra will expand enormously over the next five years as it develops infrastructure in broadband cabling and information dissemination. It seems as if the government will be selling us well short. Overseas buyers must be just waiting in the wings to get their hands on this vital piece of social infrastructure, and the ceiling on foreign ownership will be flouted by clever derivative deals. What a good time to buy Telstra. It really is going at bargain basement price.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra is not something which should be subjected to short-term profiteering at the loss of long-term infrastructure development, which will provide long-term benefits for the community and the economy. Some honourable members may not be familiar with what the information age will do for the global economy. Already we see our children communicating with friends all over the world. In a technological sense, our world really is shrinking. We must provide all Australian people, especially our children, with access to the world. If not for our benefit but for theirs, we must maintain this access.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As recently as 10 years ago, many workers could not imagine receiving wages through automatic banking. But many government members cannot see the value of retaining Telstra. The rate of technological change is almost as fast as the introduction of this bill into the parliament. The world is in a new age&mdash;the information age. The information superhighway is to this age what the printing <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> press was to the industrial age. The present information age is one where access to information is vital to growth and global competitiveness. Electronic access to information is quickly becoming the currency of education advancement and basic human communication.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Businesses in rural Australia, such as that of solicitors, could not survive without that information technology, nor will they be able to afford to in the future. That access is precious, and we must ensure that all Australians can afford to have it. Government ownership of Telstra will maintain access for all people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many members on the other side of the chamber have been comparing the partial privatisation of Telstra to the privatisation of Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank and have been asking how it is different. It could not be more different. The services offered by the Commonwealth Bank were offered by many other similar institutions. Its share of the Australian market was about 20 per cent at the time of privatisation. I think that Telstra's is about 90 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Qantas we have an airline that services a small proportion of Australians&mdash;in contrast to the perceived reality of those opposite that all Australians regularly fly. Unlike banking and travel, telecommunication is a basic requirement and must be available at a fair and equitable cost to all Australians no matter where they live.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There exists one analogy to be drawn between the sale of the Commonwealth Bank and the proposed sale of Telstra. Since the sale of the Commonwealth Bank, many Commonwealth Bank branches have closed in my electorate. I know that other members on both sides of the House have had Commonwealth Bank branches close in their electorates. I asked those members what was the response they received from the former Treasurer when they sought his assistance. Of course, they were told that the government cannot intervene in, or attempt to influence, Commonwealth Bank management decisions, and that we owe that to those who purchase shares. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="624">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I asked honourable members what they were told when they contacted Commonwealth Bank management. They were basically told to go and get knotted. They were told, `We must ensure the maximum possible return for our shareholders.' When the member for Farrer, the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), the member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) and all other honourable members on the other side of the House go to the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) to complain that telephone and other telecommunications services such as payphones are being wound down in their electorates, do you know what they will be told? You guessed it, Mr Deputy Speaker. They will be told, `We cannot intervene in management decisions of Telstra; we must ensure maximum return for its shareholders.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As part of the bill's provisions, there exist some so-called protections for consumers. For example, all subscribers are entitled to what the bill calls a standard telephone service. I think that not even a politician as conservative as Menzies would flog off Telstra. However, one has to ask, if Menzies had privatised the operations of the Postmaster-General, whether rural telephone subscribers would be still turning the dial and still wondering whether the local telephone exchange lady was listening in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been much said in this House about the economic implications of the sale of Telstra. We have heard many speakers talk about the dividends it returns to the Commonwealth and, therefore, the dividends it earns and produces for the people of this nation. Similarly, we have heard a lot about the tax paid by Telstra into consolidated revenue and the benefits of that to the people of this nation. We have heard about the impact upon our balance of payments of profits going to overseas investors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is probably more important than anything to me, having a very strong interest in rural and regional Australia and having a very great concern about an issue I raised during my first speech in this place, relates to the dynamic decline, or the slow but sure death, of country towns. The issue I refer to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is jobs. I think we have all seen those pieces of paper doing the rounds in the corridors of parliament, quoting examples of how other overseas operators post-privatisation have shed jobs. There is no doubt that what goes hand in hand with the privatisation of Telstra is jobs slashing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that in the country we are losing jobs in the CES already. We know that in all government departments in the country we are going to be losing jobs. We know that the Treasurer (Mr Costello) has foreshadowed cuts to rural assistance programs, and we all know that that is going to lead not only to the loss of jobs but to the closure of many longstanding family farms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the final nail in the coffin for rural Australia. Jobs will be slashed to maximise profits under a privatised Telstra, and jobs in rural and regional Australia will once again go. I commend the amendment of the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I commence I should make some observations&mdash;respectful ones, I hope&mdash;on the contribution by the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon). He engaged in a little one&hyphen;act play fantasy at the commencement of his speech. Might I suggest, with all respect, that he return to his former occupation as far as that is concerned. He also spoke unrelentingly about local calls now being timed. This line was constantly trotted out by the ALP during the election campaign. It got them nowhere and it was rejected by the Australian people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Hunter also mentioned the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. I think I detected a bit of chiding of the former Treasurer in his comments there. The whole of the bank was sold. I do not need to remind people about Mr Keating's hand on his heart in respect of the sale of half of the bank. That was abandoned very quickly, much to the chagrin of the left wing of the ALP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Hunter does not draw the distinction between the sale of the whole of the bank and the proposed sale of one&hyphen;third of Telstra. It is important to make those distinctions because that is what the Telstra bill is all about. He talks about jobs, too. He must have forgotten about the gutting <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="625"> of Telstra&mdash;or Telecom, as it was&mdash;a few years ago when jobs were lost left, right and centre under his party's administration. His memory, with all respect to him, is very selective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support this bill. The coalition position is very clear: there is no hidden agenda here. It is the sale of one&hyphen;third, not the whole, of Telstra&mdash;no foreign control. Individual foreign ownership is limited to a maximum of 1.6667 per cent and a maximum aggregate foreign ownership of 11.6667 per cent. I repeat: no foreign control. How many more times does the opposition want us to say it? Do they want us to repeat it in Spanish?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The service will improve. There are guarantees in the bill regarding untimed local calls. Remember a few years ago when this was floated by the previous regime? I have a memory of this being floated by the previous government. It was put about. They tested the waters on timed local calls but they found very quickly that there was universal opposition, so they quickly lined up with the opposition on that and rejected it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Improving access, including improving regional access, is the key to customer service guarantees. The member for Hunter would be interested in that, it would seem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Concerning employees, do not forget that this proposal is integrated with the one&hyphen;third share float. In other words, in any industrial giant such as Telstra the participation of the work force in profitability by ownership encourages greater enterprise and productivity by employees and will have a big impact in creating industrial harmony.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The commitment to Telstra workers on shareholding is that two per cent of the float is reserved for Telstra employees. That is an offer of one free share for every four shares purchased to a maximum limit of 500 free shares per employee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The commitment goes on. It extends to loyalty bonuses being available to employees who hold shares for 12 months. So there is an opportunity here also for the largest number of Australians, including Telstra workers, to own shares in the company where they are <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> working. Employees' involvement cannot be understated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of comments made by the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) about job losses, which I have already referred to, are simply hollow rhetoric. As I said earlier, we saw the guts ripped out of Telecom's work force under the aegis of the member for Dobell as the former responsible minister and as a member of that government. I can tell you that my family had personal experience of that. I also encountered in my legal practice a number of people who lost their jobs and were gently pushed aside&mdash;some not so gently, I might add. There were massive redundancies and low morale. So do not have a selective memory about this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As anyone who has worked with their hands will know, in any industrial enterprise the secret of a happy work environment is engendering participation by the employees in the company as part&hyphen;owners. What better way is there than by offering workers shares and giving them incentives to own shares?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill embodies customer service guarantees such as standards for connections of service; rectification of faults; keeping appointments; payment of damages where the standards are contravened, involving automatic credit to customers' accounts where performance standards are not met&mdash;a revolutionary proposal, in my submission&mdash;the availability to sue Telstra for damages for not meeting the requirements; and Austel to review and report annually on the carrier's performance. Customers also have a choice: they can waive their guaranteed rights and opt for a rebate in lieu thereof.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill has monitoring devices for the performance of Telstra. Experience has shown that the discipline of having performance reflected daily in Telstra's share price will stimulate improvements in all aspects of the company's performance. There really seems no credible contrary argument. As the major shareholder, the Commonwealth will have the means to monitor its continuing investment on behalf of the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As part of that monitoring process, the following reporting mechanisms demonstrate that the bill will require Telstra to: give to the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="626"> minister financial statements; notify the minister of significant events such as forming companies, joint ventures and acquisitions; and keep the minister informed of its ongoing operations, with there being powers for the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) and the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) to request specific reports, documents and information. In this respect, in recent years&mdash;pre&hyphen;Optus&mdash;there has been a tendency for Telstra to unduly promote itself by way of expensive, unnecessary advertising. Surely this is an area where some government surveillance and control is warranted. Furthermore, the Auditor-General will continue to audit Telstra's accounts, and there will be a requirement to prepare, update and provide corporate plans to the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we are not, as the opposition would have everybody believe with their scaremongering tactics, leaving the Australian people at the mercy of a privatised Telstra. Quite the contrary. To make comparisons with British Telecom, as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) attempted to, is fatuous and silly. British Telecom was sold lock, stock and barrel in one hit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The corporatisation of Telstra really started under the Labor Party in government. It had its genesis in the Whitlam government. It followed with Australia Post and Telecom being divided from the old PMG department. Then the Telecommunications Act 1991 set corporatisation further on the road, encouraging more competitors to come along. This is perhaps the lead-up to the former Prime Minister's comment which members opposite do not like to hear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Had the Australian people the misfortune to have another three years of Labor, there is no doubt that not one-third of Telstra would have been sold but the whole lot. Honourable members will remember the comment of the former Prime Minister in relation to the privatisation of Telstra: `not of its essence'. In my understanding of the English language, `essence' is a word of philosophical portent. It is going to the philosophical nature of something, in this case whether there is public or private ownership.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has led to the attitude of the opposition? During the election campaign when this policy was announced in conjunction with the environment policy, the Labor Party were totally flummoxed. There was a deathly silence for a number of days. Out on the campaign trail, I could hardly believe my luck. What really got under their skin was the fact that the conservative parties in this country had demonstrated that they had the most far&hyphen;sighted plan for the environment that this country had ever seen. The Labor Party could not believe it. No doubt, after many late night discussions, they thought they could turn this policy to their advantage. They were drowning at the polls during the campaign for want of any issue to campaign on. This issue became their great lifeline. So they launched into the biggest campaign of misrepresentation, false pretences, deceit and naked hoodwinking. Every conceivable piece of political chicanery was used to frighten people. We heard more of it in the speech of the member for Hunter, who was frightening people about the suggested costs of having a telephone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We heard about selling Telstra off to foreign hands. We heard about timed calls and about the gutting of Telstra. Someone on the other side even dreamed up a figure of $30,000 for a private telephone connection in the seat of the member for Bass (Mr Warwick Smith). Speakers opposite repeated the same old rhetoric. The member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) was driven to submit that the government was a bad economic manager. He reminded me of the old criminal law hacks: defence counsel addressing juries in hopeless cases will submit absolutely anything. But can you believe the gall? We have been in government just over two months and we are bad economic managers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Dobell says that the sale of Telstra is different from the sale of the Commonwealth Bank because Telstra holds 90 per cent of the market. When the percentage changes, as it undoubtedly will with more competitors, does his argument change? It just does not make any rational sense. None of the arguments are substantive arguments. They are rhetorical arguments, spoiling arguments, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="627"> bloody&hyphen;minded arguments. Having listened to a number of speakers on the other side, I ask myself why they are taking this attitude. What initially appeared to be a carefully constructed argument by the member for Werriwa lost all credibility as it went along because it was so transparent. It was all about fear and obfuscation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party is in a state of policy vacuum. Having thrown everything it possibly could at this proposal during the election campaign and lost, it cannot take it. It is trying to rewrite history, as it tried to do in 1975 after it was sacked, and rightly sacked. It was sacked in 1996 and now it wants to say that it was not sacked on this issue. At least we understand and sympathise that the Labor Party has painted itself into a corner. Like it or not&mdash;whether out of some misguided loyalty to Paul Keating or sheer embarrassment that the coalition has the best environment policy this country has ever seen&mdash;it is stuck with its hopeless position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the Democrats, it is something else. It is about time they were seen for what they really are: unctuous idealogues of the far left wing of Australian politics. The irony is that when confronted with their own puerile slogan they even renege on that. They are the chardonnay socialists of Australian politics. Enough said. As an aside, I might say that I thought of that before the minister for employment did in question time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why do we need this bill passed? I am not ashamed in the slightest at linking the sale to two key elements. The member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) will appreciate this. The first key element is to reduce the national debt of more than $100 billion accumulated by the opposition when in government. The second is a comprehensive and far&hyphen;sighted program to deal with our environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> As to the first element, it is sometimes forgotten that the mandate to sell Telstra includes a mandate to reduce the national debt. Thus, opposition to this measure means a concerted attempt by those opposing to undermine the integrated economic program of the government. It is designed to get this country working by creating and maintaining jobs, reducing interest rates and doing some thing about the shocking level of national debt. I emphasise that this bill is an integral part of a program for economic recovery. To say that the coalition has no mandate is to attempt to violate the very concept of democracy. It is saying that the majority wishes are to be ignored.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to the second element, the commitment of $1 billion to the Natural Heritage Trust demonstrates an absolute determination to maintain and replenish Australia's environment. It strikes me as odd that the opposition has paraded in here, worshipping at the feet of Telstra as if it is some inviolable god and yet is not prepared to express the same devotion to the environment, which was here long before Telecom and Telstra and which, provided the nurturing policies of the coalition are implemented, I suspect will remain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The broad strategy of the government recognises that national action must be taken to address issues of salinity, soil erosion, noxious weeds, feral animals and water degradation and preserve areas of unique importance for not only this generation but future generations. For example, in my own electorate of Dickson there are a number of areas in this category. I think in particular of the Bunya Park Sanctuary. This very unique area is quite close to Brisbane. There is nothing like it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the lead-up to the election on a number of occasions I had contact with the former minister for the environment. I released and sent to the minister hundreds of letters and petitions from people wanting to save this sanctuary. Nothing was done. They said that it may not come under their particular program at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The policies that are promulgated by the government on the environment are designed, provided a case is made out, to preserve the pristine and otherwise unique nature of areas such as Bunya Park. In that respect there is $80 million set aside across Australia. There is $318 million set aside for a national vegetation initiative, $163 million for the Murray&hyphen;Darling 2001 project, $100 million for the coast and clean seas initiative and $32 million for the national land and water resources audit. Thereafter, over $300 million will <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="628"> remain in trust in perpetuity to enhance the quality of the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill provides a unique opportunity for bipartisanship. At times it is difficult to understand the attitude of the opposition to it. One almost feels sorry for them. They seem to have got themselves into a corner. We all want a better environment for us, our children and our grandchildren. It is related to the changing of the culture. It has to be put on the political agenda and that is what we are doing by this bill and by the proposals that we have. As I said, we have the opportunity to do that with this bill. After all, in reality, in simple terms, it is an exchange of some bricks and mortar for clean forests, streams and coastlines. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think we are probably dealing with one of the most significant pieces of legislation that will come through this House in the 1990s. It represents the very major ideological difference between ourselves and the new government. Why are we so opposed to the sell off of Telstra? There are some very good reasons for it. Let us go through them. Firstly, it is Australia's major government business enterprise. It was established by government to serve a nationwide objective. The organisation, following corporatisation and under government direction during the last decade in particular, has been the prime mover in one of Australia's modern success stories.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are literally thousands of businesses and people working in those businesses across Australia who now contract either directly to Telstra or who have business opportunities in Australia and outside Australia through their partnerships with Telstra. Even the competitor, Optus, which we put in place to provide a competitive regime, relies intensely on Telstra's network and on the expertise that has been built up in Australia through the former Telecom's business contracts and engineering expertise, and continues to rely on that. So too does Vodafone, which is now entering the market aggressively as a third provider of telephone services to people in Australia. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are talking here about a government business enterprise that is wholly government owned and to which Labor made an absolute commitment. It intends to stick by that commitment in every way it possibly can so that Telecom or Telstra shall remain in full public ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the period from 1987 to 1995, in the process of corporatisation and in the fining down&mdash;making more competitive or whatever you like to call it&mdash;of Telecom, the organisation shed 35,000 jobs. And that is not something that has been lost on many of us. The organisation has gone through enormous restructure and has in fact undertaken a very painful path of repositioning itself to be not only a premier provider of telecommunications services within this nation but also one of the leaders out in the modern world of information technology and one of Australia's leading export companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One has to say that, no matter what happens in the future, technology will mean more jobs lost within this company. But I can tell you that, if you privatise it and give it a set of private owners who have quite different interests from a government owner which is insisting on community service obligations both as an employer and as the provider of a universal network across Australia at affordable prices, the interests and objectives of private owners will be quite different from the objectives of government as an owner. I can tell you right now that, no matter to what extent you privatise Telstra, you cause immediately that conflict to come into play and that means major job shedding in the organisation. I am yet to see a private sector operator who does not think that the best way to fix the bottom line or to improve profits is to get rid of people. I am yet to see it in these major enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The argument being raised by the new government is, `Labor is not fair dinkum about public ownership of Telstra because look what happened to Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank and what it tried to do with ANL&mdash;privatise them and sell them.' We have always said that each of these government business enterprises needed to be considered on its merits and we have always <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="629"> made the very strong public position clear that Telecom and Australia Post were to remain in full public ownership because of their position in the marketplace, because of their universal service delivery obligations and, not the least, because they are very profitable enterprises that produce a very nice dividend to budget. I want to come back to this point in a minute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Organisations like Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank were established to provide a service that was new in Australia and government needed to establish them. With Qantas, until there was a mature aviation industry in this nation, of course, the government had a role to own and operate a major airline. But times changed and Qantas needed to become part of international syndicates to hold any place in this new world of aviation. You cannot become a part of a syndicate unless you can exchange shareholdings. It is a case of, `We will give you a piece of our airline in return for your giving us a piece of yours.' That is exactly what has happened. Qantas has been involved in strategic partnerships and public fundraising for very good reason.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the Commonwealth Bank was first set up by the Labor government in Australia many decades ago, it was for specific purposes. Firstly, it was to provide ordinary Australians with access to finance that they could not get from the banking sector because it found it very difficult to deal with ordinary working people with housing loans, et cetera. Secondly, it was set up to provide a competitor in a highly regulated banking industry which was not responsive to the needs of ordinary people. The Commonwealth Bank did all of those things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But again times changed. We now have a highly competitive banking environment. You have only to look at all the banking institutions and non&hyphen;bank institutions competing for home loan business now to see that the Commonwealth Bank's role as a major provider of home loans has changed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> I want to make a point about this which I have made before. There is a difference between government and private shareholders when it comes to ownership of a government business enterprise. There is no better exam ple of this than what has taken place with the Commonwealth Bank since it has taken on private shareholders. The bank board now has no option but to respond to the profit motive that is required by its shareholders and its directors. It no longer sees itself as having an obligation to behave in the community in the way that the government used to insist that it behaved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make no bones about the fact that I have been very angry about the behaviour of the Commonwealth Bank towards small account holders. I have seen the bank close branches in parts of regional Victoria, in breach of undertakings that were given about the way the bank would conduct its merger with the State Bank of Victoria, and I have made my views known very clearly to the management of the Commonwealth Bank. But I cannot deny that, once there are private shareholders, the board and the senior management have no option but to respond to the needs of those private shareholders. So it is a nonsense for those opposite to come into this parliament and say that, even though the government is selling only one&hyphen;third of Telstra, the government is still going to run the show because it still has the majority ownership. The fact is that you cannot with any integrity deny the maximum return to the private shareholders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will tell an interesting little tale because I suppose there would be very few members in this chamber who have had as direct involvement in this reform of the telecommunications industry as I have over a period of years. At one of our meetings, I remember the corporate accountant giving us a briefing on the financial report of Telstra and making the point that the dividend to government was going to be very close to $1 billion in that particular year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I asked why Telecom was paying so much corporate tax when many other corporate organisations with revenue bases and cost structures less than Telecom and, therefore, with more profits were paying significantly less. Their response to me was, `We are a government business organisation and you people require us to pay our tax and report our revenue in full compliance with the federal government's proper conduct of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="630"> business.' If I were to put it in other terms, they were under specific direction from the Treasurer not to seek the sorts of tax minimisation schemes that are available to large corporations if they employ all the right lawyers and go through all the loopholes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minute you privatise this show in any way you will have a number of shareholders expecting the organisation to find every possible way to reduce its tax payments to the federal Treasury because that improves the return to them. If you privatise it, it will shed more jobs than it would have and it will pay less tax than it does now because that is what the shareholders will insist on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have to ask: what sense does this make to a federal government that claims it has a budget problem to deal with and claims it wants to deal with unemployment? The bottom line is just as we have found: no matter from what angle you come at this, Telstra is one of Australia's very major business success stories and it makes more sense for any government, whether it is Liberal or Labor, to keep it in full public ownership than to privatise it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will not go over the arguments that have been raised by a number of my colleagues about the cross-subsidies in rural areas and all those other points. You cannot cover it all in one short speech. But I will make this statement very clear in this parliament: everywhere I go in Australia, whether it be in towns or suburbs in my own electorate or whether it be in the regions of Victoria or anywhere else in Australia, I will be spelling out the inanity of this proposal to privatise one-third of Telstra and, obviously, the plan to take that further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The implications are much broader than just the CSOs on the local phone network and on the cost of provision of services to rural and regional subscribers. This is also about the provision of mobile phones. Every time these organisations put their mobile phone networks in place outside major metropolitan areas, it costs them more and they service fewer providers. So the CSO and the cross-subsidy issues relate to mobile phones. They also relate to fibre optic cable, the Internet and that whole information technology access issue for people outside Sydney, Melbourne, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Adelaide, Brisbane, Perth and Canberra. It is a very broad issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two other points that I want to comment on quickly. We have heard a lot about what I describe as the obscenity of tying the sale of Telstra to `the world's most fabulous environment package'. To start with, let us look at this fabulous environment package. Whether it is the Murray-Darling Basin, the national forest strategy, landcare, the new green army, which is really only the landcare environment action program&mdash;LEAP, as we called it&mdash;the coast, the rivers or the air, whatever you want to call it, not a single piece of this environment package was not already in place and being conducted under the former Labor government's environment strategy. Certainly, $1 billion sounds like an increase in the amount, but it amounts to about 2&half; years of the current program in the current budget. There is nothing in this proposal that says how anyone intends to deal with what happens after 2&half; years worth of money is spent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What happens is that you come along to your budget and you have to find it there again. These programs have to be continued. Labor put them in place. Everybody knows they have to be continued. It does not matter whether you fund them in your recurrent budget or you pull this little con trick of using $1 billion from the sale of Telstra, because in 2&half; years time you are back to where you started&mdash;that is, you have to continue funding it off your recurrent budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an obscenity to try to blackmail the Senate and the people of Australia into believing, firstly, that they are getting anything new with this environment package or, secondly, that they have to see their publicly owned telephone network flogged in order to preserve the environment. That is another point I will be making everywhere I go around Australia. The former Labor government put these environment programs in place and funded them directly off budget without tying it to the sale of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is absurd for a federal Treasurer to give up a long-term income stream from the profits of the most successful public enterprise we have for a quick grab for cash in order to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="631"> satisfy an ideology that somehow we have to privatise these shows. In fact, it is absolutely misleading to the Australian people to pretend that they will get anything more in an environment package than they are already getting and to not say that after the $1 billion from Telstra is spent the government will have to come back to the budget and raise taxes in order to fund the program that they are just continuing on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whether it is the Costello con about the $8 billion black hole or whether it is the Telstra con about $1 billion to the environment, we are dealing with a government which, when in opposition, went to the people very clearly on a major platform of no change, of adopting Labor's policies, of funding their election promises and of no new taxes. What have we found out in the parliament today? The new GST, the tariff GST. We are now going to find out that once the $1 billion has been spent we will have to impose a tax to keep the environment programs going. It is a con and it will be exposed as a con. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to speak in support of the government's Telstra privatisation legislation. The partial privatisation of Telstra provides Australia with a very important and historic opportunity to address the future of Telstra and the telecommunications industry, to tackle some of the enormous debt the new government has had to grapple with because of the mismanagement of the last 13 years of Labor government in Australia, and to establish a firm, funded program to deal with the urgent conservation and heritage issues facing this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation provides for one-third of Telstra to be listed on the Australian Stock Exchange, to use layman's language. This will enable ordinary Australians, and employees of Telstra, to take up the shares. I have been seen by a number of employees of Telstra who are very anxious to see if some of their superannuation can be put into the shares so they can enjoy the ownership of a company that they are proud to work for, that they see has a great future, that they see will be invigorated by the Howard government's <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> policies and that will provide them with a very good investment for their future retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many obstacles in the way of the government achieving these worthwhile and urgent objectives. We realise that. During the election campaign it became very evident that the Labor Party would say and do anything in order to frighten the Australian people about the proposals for the conservation and environment package and about Telstra. We saw some outrageous misrepresentations and false advertisements by the Labor Party during the election campaign. I hope that on another occasion in this place we will be able to examine that in terms of future electoral behaviour and ethics&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You can sneer at what I am saying, but I can assure you that a lot of ordinary Australians are unhappy with the performance of the Labor Party in many ways. During the campaign they actually circulated fake phone bills. I am making very serious allegations. I hope the shadow minister for employment and training, who is at the table, will listen carefully to them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party circulated fake phone bills to local residents in order to persuade them to vote against the coalition candidates, in order to keep power. It said that phone bills for ordinary people would be charged out under a one-third privatised Telstra at enormously inflated rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They widely circulated these fake phone bills in the electorate of Braddon in Tasmania in particular. One of them was addressed to `Mr and Mrs Resident' and it warned locals that they would have to pay a phone service and rental fee of $800 under a partly privatised Telstra as well as a charge of $215.80 for timed local calls. The Labor Party actually used the format of the Telstra account, which we are all familiar with. They actually printed into the format those exorbitant amounts of Telstra fees as if it was an official Telstra charge and policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that they targeted seats like Braddon. That seat was held by Mr Miles <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="632"> prior to the election with a 2.9 per cent majority on a two-party preferred basis. The Labor Party undertook massive direct mailing and had public meetings and other propaganda based on these fake invoices to frighten and deceive people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Naturally, we were all interested to see the outcome of the election. It is good to reflect on the result&mdash;I use Braddon as an example&mdash;because there is also, as part of this legislation and this debate, the issue of whether the Howard government informed the Australian community of its proposals widely, whether the Australian community was able to hear the rebuttals from the other candidates&mdash;from the Democrats, the Labor Party, the Greens and Independents&mdash;and whether the Australian people factored into their vote a judgment in favour of the proposals of the alternative government, the then Howard&hyphen;led opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I assert that there is no doubt that the Telstra policy was widely circulated, canvassed and debated by the new Prime Minister, John Howard, when he was opposition leader. It was criticised, maligned, attacked, misrepresented and subjected to grave misrepresentation by the Labor Party particularly. Residents and voters throughout Australia, such as in Braddon, received direct mail and all had their attention drawn to this proposal. It is interesting to note, using the example of Braddon, which was held by the sitting Liberal member Mr Miles with a margin of 2.8 per cent, that as a result of all of Labor's false propaganda in the election Mr Miles increased his vote and in fact doubled his majority. He now holds Braddon by a two&hyphen;party preferred majority of 5.7 per cent compared with 2.8 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To put into context the effect of the propaganda&mdash;the false and phoney bills which frightened many innocent people&mdash;I will relate some instances which occurred during my campaign in the electorate of Indi. For example, I was approached by low income pensioners living in Wangaratta who were distressed because they saw the Labor candidate, the previous Prime Minister and other members of the discredited government going about their business trying to undermine and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> demolish the Liberal and National parties' proposals regarding Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is never pleasant as a member of parliament or as a candidate to have to talk with constituents across Australia who have been frightened and who feel that their security and future ability to maintain their phone service, in this case, is beyond their grasp. It is not a pleasant task. I find one of the worst features of politics is that people are given assertions and material which is not accurate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On a number of occasions I had to deal with those sorts of concerns, and I did it to the best of my ability. I also took the trouble to write to every newspaper and media outlet in country Victoria, certainly in my electorate, explaining the Telstra policy of the then alternative government so that it was widely canvassed. That was typical of all of the candidates for the Liberal&hyphen;National Party in Australia. We widely canvassed it. As I said, we were attacked, maligned and subjected to false documents being circulated. We stood our ground, we explained our policy carefully, and John Howard and Tim Fischer received an overwhelming mandate for their policies. It is in that context that we in the House of Representatives are dealing with the first part of important legislation which the Australian public has already indicated that it approves in principle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In listening to the members of the opposition criticise this legislation over the last couple of days, they have attempted to say that directors of a one-third privatised Telstra will be obliged to answer the call of the private shareholders and will be obliged to discard the community service obligations: for example, untimed local calls will be discontinued and Telstra will be prevented from delivering the service across Australia to isolated communities. That is a total lie by members of the opposition who are putting that view. Alternatively, it is an indication of their ignorance and that they have not read the Telstra bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that directors in a public company are required to do their best to earn the maximum profits in the context of their obligations, using the assets of the company that they are the directors of. I have a little <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="633"> knowledge of this as I am a Fellow of the Australian Institute of Company Directors. I am aware of the corporate responsibilities involved in being a director, particularly in a public company. But the directors' obligations, and the relationship between the shareholders and the directors, are spelt out in the memorandum and articles of the company. In this case, it is the legislation that enables the memorandum and articles to be established and the process of shares to take place. The directors' obligations are read subject to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition has tried&mdash;perhaps through ignorance because it does not realise&mdash;to represent this legislation as legislation that will be discarded inevitably by the directors because the shareholders of the one-third ownership will insist that they abandon the community service obligations. That is just nonsense, it is poppycock, because it is a matter of law that the directors and shareholders will not be able to discard the community service obligations since they will be enshrined in legislation. The memorandum and articles of the company will reflect all that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> If members of the opposition are challenging us and are threatening to go around Australia to make all of these various assertions, all I say to you is that you are even more out of touch with the Australian community than I thought you were and that you did not learn anything at all from the devastating defeat that you suffered on 2 March. Furthermore, if you are intent on building your party into a great party again, do you honestly believe that you are going to do so by going around Australia making misleading statements on important matters of policy in order to maintain or gain some advantage for yourselves and some greater political input into the process of Australian politics in the future?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You are totally out of touch if you think the Australian community will swallow the sort of misrepresentation that has come from numerous members of the opposition when we hear them talk on this matter. While I will be sad if you do what you say you will, I look forward to the debate across Australia when you do it.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XU5">Mr LIEBERMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. When the former Prime Minister came to the electorates of Farrer and Indi to launch the then government's environmental policy, he did it at the Murray&hyphen;Darling Freshwater Research Centre, which is located just out of Albury at Thurgoona. That was actually a couple of days before he went to the Governor&hyphen;General and the parliament was dissolved. The now Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) and I were pleased to see him visiting our electorates. But, while he was there making his great promises about the future Keating government's environmental policies&mdash;addressing things that they should have addressed 13 years ago, I might add, although God knows how he was going to pay for them&mdash;the very place that he used as his backdrop, the research centre, was not being funded by the Labor government!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Deputy Prime Minister and I, for the last 3&half; years, have pursued the outgoing government and its ministers to resolve the funding problems that the Murray&hyphen;Darling Freshwater Research Centre has had to put up with because the Keating government failed to provide adequate funds to enable the core research into the Murray&hyphen;Darling freshwater resource to be maintained. To this day, the new government, on top of the deficit we have inherited&mdash;which was concealed from the Australian people&mdash;is grappling with issues like finding the solution to funding important research centres like the Murray&hyphen;Darling Freshwater Research Centre which was neglected over the last few years by the Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will resolve that problem. We will find a way to do it. Part of the solution to the urgent environmental and heritage issues, particularly in the Murray&hyphen;Darling area, is to provide a firm funding basis. It is poppycock for opposition speakers to say they had a great environmental policy that was funded and that they were going to do all the things that this new government has said it will do. That is just not right, because the Labor government ran us into a deficit.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="634">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They were borrowing more money all the time. They took total borrowings to $180 billion, increasing the government's debt by more than four times in about four years, from memory. They have actually put this country in a position where we have to spend $10,000 million a year just to pay the interest on the government component of the debt which it ran up. Incidentally, that $10,000 million virtually represents all the money that we as a Commonwealth have to spend on health. It is a vast sum of money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I heard opposition speakers today saying that their environmental policy was stolen by the government and that, furthermore, they had it all paid for. That is just not true. If they had been re&hyphen;elected&mdash;heaven forbid&mdash;they would have had to break their promise or increase taxes or borrowings, or both, and God knows what else. And at what cost to small business, to young people trying to get jobs, to people in semi&hyphen;retirement and others who have been trying to find the security that has been slipping away during 13 years of Labor government?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those in the opposition are the people who are now saying that they have some credibility and should be listened to in this debate. I simply say to them that they do not have credibility but they do have the opportunity to reassess where they are at. The position that I put very strongly to the parliament is that we now have a unique opportunity to do a number of things through this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, we have the opportunity to enable Telstra to go into the next century properly capitalised and in a position to compete and expand, as we all hope it will. In fact, I call this legislation `Telstra liberation legislation'. The fact is&mdash;if those opposite do not know this, I suggest they get briefings&mdash;to be able to compete in the telecommunications market in Australia and around the world, which is what we want Telstra to do, it will need access to vast amounts of capital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the Labor Party's dead&hyphen;hand policy prevails and they stop this one&hyphen;third privatisation, they will force the Commonwealth&mdash;the Australia taxpayers&mdash;to provide further funds, further loan money, to enable Telstra to struggle to compete with all of the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> other competitors. You cannot do that to a great organisation like Telstra. You must liberate it; you must enable it to have access. The way to do that is to enable it to have access to the private sector in the way that is proposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point is that it is a nonsense to say that Telstra is an entity that has to be protected. The Hawke-Keating government brought in Optus to take a share of the mobile telephone market. Vodafone is now in the market as well. The market is already alive, already increasingly more competitive. Telstra cannot be left in the shadows, cannot be kept back from meeting the challenges that it faces and should be able to face. It should be liberated and allowed to go into the future.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> (Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(6.22 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we are debating a crucial piece of legislation, the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill 1996. As other speakers have said, this is probably going to be one of the most important pieces of legislation to come before this parliament. That can be shown by the amount of public debate that has occurred and by the number of speakers seeking to put their views on this legislation. It can be shown by the angst that has occurred in various question times in the last couple of weeks when the government have tried to defend their position on this issue and it can be shown by the detail within the legislation and its very far&hyphen;reaching implications for Australian society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the issues that have come up continually in the Telstra debate, particularly since the election, has been that of a mandate. The government have been saying ad nauseam that they have a mandate to move forward with this policy. I think that in politics `mandate' is sometimes a much abused word. I guess we all use it on various occasions to defend the actions that we may take as a government or as an opposition. Certainly in the last couple of weeks in particular, but also since the election, `mandate' has gone far beyond what many Australians saw when they went to the polls on 2 March. There is no doubt that we lost the election and, having lost that election, we have many lessons to learn in the future. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="635"> I believe we will learn those lessons. However, we also have to look at the reasons for that loss as opposed to what some say the reasons are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we look at the way the government have used the word `mandate' in the last few weeks, we find that it covers industrial relations policy, family policy, taxation policy, general economic policy and environment policy. You name it, it covers it.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VU5">Mr GRIFFIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. It has been used to cover almost every government policy, except the ones that they are going to dump over the next couple of months. It also covers a whole range of policies which were not their policies at the time of the election&mdash;for example, the movements in the public sector; the massive downsizing of the Public Service. We see it also being used by the minor parties&mdash;for example, the Australian Democrats&mdash;in their opposition to the sale of Telstra. We see it also from the Labor Party, of which I am proud to be a member, in our opposition to the sale of Telstra.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I guess we will keep debating that word and the word will be abused on a continuing basis by just about everybody, but I am here to say that I have always opposed the sale of Telstra. I have opposed it in party forums, I have opposed it within the caucus, and I will continue to oppose it. Members of my party&mdash;certainly the ones that I have spoken to, and I have spoken to most&mdash;oppose the sale of Telstra, have always opposed the sale of Telstra and will continue to oppose the sale of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra is an icon of the Australian community. Telecommunications policy and telecommunications activities are an even more important part of Australian society today then they were 10, 20 or 30 years ago. We are a large country with a population which is spread significantly around the edges. Telecommunications is crucial to the community; it is crucial to the social wellbeing of many Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Privatisation has also been an issue which has been raised in terms of Telstra and the sell&hyphen;off. One of the government's arguments <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> has been: we have privatised so many things as a government, what's another thing? The Commonwealth Bank and Qantas&mdash;essentially the argument is that we privatised, therefore, we should support this proposal and, if we do not support it, we are being intellectually dishonest. The argument that if you privatise some things you therefore support privatising everything is ridiculous. I am sure we all agree that some things should not be privatised.

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VU5">Mr GRIFFIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The actions of state governments in some of these areas are worthy of note, as the member for Batman just mentioned by way of interjection. In South Australia we are seeing a range of utilities being considered for sell&hyphen;off. In Victoria we are seeing the same thing. Each issue has to be judged on its merits. Each piece of legislation has to be judged on what it will do for Australian society. When we talk about privatisation, each enterprise has to be judged on a range of criteria as to whether or not it is in the country's interests for that entity to be privatised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank are two entities that have been mentioned on a regular basis and people have said, `They are just the same.' They are not the same. Qantas is an airline in an area where there are many airlines. The Commonwealth Bank is a bank in a situation where there are many banks. I would have to say that I did not support in our internal party processes the Commonwealth Bank being sold either. But the fact of the matter is that they are both in competitive markets. Both are not operating as monopolies. Because a large number of players are involved, issues such as community service obligations and fairness and equity can be taken care of to a large extent under the question of competition.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="636">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the environment of recent years the capacity of the Commonwealth Bank or Qantas has not been such as to cause great aggravation in the operation of their sectors in the Australian community. Another difference is the fact that both Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank, as has been said by other speakers, were in need of urgent capital injections. The question which faces government is whether huge sums of taxpayers' money being placed into these entities, and in that way maintaining them and helping them grow, is preferable to private sector support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra is a very different kettle of fish. Telstra has about 90 per cent of the telecommunications market in Australia. That will change to an extent. As has been mentioned by other speakers, Optus and, more recently, Vodafone have come into the market, and other niche market operators will come into the field over time. That is having an impact and will continue to have an impact. The impact competition has had on a wide range of telecommunications services is that there have been cuts in STD and ISD call rates and, I think, improved service delivery. Certainly when I had a phone connected I was impressed by the service given by those providers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other competitors are still developing, even though Telstra dominates the market. That is important because there are elements of the services that Telstra provides that would be unlikely to be profitable for other competitors. These elements relate to the national interest&mdash;rural and regional Australia and the poor and disadvantaged in society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another issue which has been raised in recent times is the Senate. I found that pretty amusing. I remember sitting on the other side of the House just a few short months ago&mdash;I much preferred sitting there, I have to admit&mdash;and I heard someone, I forget who it was now, define the Senate as `unrepresentative swill'. Normally I heard it coming from this side as an attack on the then Prime Minister. But certainly the comments from the opposition at the time were very much in defence of the role of the Senate&mdash;that the Senate was a crucial part of democracy, that the Senate had a right to take decisions and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that the Senate had a right to review and, if necessary, reject legislation. The opposition defended that right even if it meant cutting up the government's program, even if it meant stopping the government from implementing election promises and even if it meant destroying the legislative program and the underlying budget position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the same way the current government might say to us that we cannot have it both ways. You are the government now and you have to deal with the Senate. In those circumstances one should try to temper the rhetoric of just how horrible the Senate is and understand and expect that members of that place have been elected to do a job. They have been elected on behalf of constituents and they have a right to make decisions. If they make decisions that affect your legislative program, they have a mandate to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another argument which has been raised is that it is all a bit of a joke, that we would sell Telstra anyway&mdash;we were hiding that from the Australian people and we were going to act on it the week after the election. Why had we not done it already? Much has been made by the government that we were on the treasury bench for some 13 years and we should have done this and we should have done that. It would seem that if we were going to move on Telstra we would have done it already.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the government very clearly underestimates the Labor Party's commitment to Telstra being a government owned enterprise. I think it massively underestimates the concern that we have, and have held for a long time, about the impact of the sale of Telstra on rural and regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another argument which has been raised by the government is that we are only talking about one-third of Telstra, that it is not full privatisation and that that in itself means everything will be all right. There is a range of reasons why everything will not be all right. It has been said by other speakers that if one-third of Telstra is privatised we will have private shareholders. That will be the result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Private shareholders are, quite rightly, in the business of trying to maximise the return on <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="637"> their investment, as are their directors. There are a range of issues relating to the operation of Telstra which will become increasingly difficult for a board of that nature to handle. The circumstances of a cross-subsidisation and a whole raft of community service obligations that are undertaken by Telstra will put that board in a situation where it will have to make difficult decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you look at the legislation and the situation that is to be faced by the government in the future, you will see that there will be inexorable pressure to privatise more of Telstra. That has not been ruled out by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) or the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston). They are not ruling out that at some time in the future&mdash;three years, five years, six years, maybe sooner&mdash;we may well be here debating another bill on the further privatisation of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even when one&hyphen;third of a board is privatised, pressure is placed on the board. You can endeavour to put safeguards in place through legislation, as the government has tried to do, to defend those community service obligations, but when you look at the sort of activity Telstra undertakes you cannot necessarily legislate for all outcomes. You cannot necessarily guarantee all the obligations that we would probably seek to have enshrined in the operation of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Legislation often has holes. Most of the time in this House we debate amendment legislation. Quite often, we are amending for new circumstances or for unintended consequences. As was said by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) earlier today, this has implications beyond strictly telephones. The whole question of communications policy in the longer term is developing at a dramatic rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Developments in communications are taking place now as we debate this issue. The whole development of pay TV and a range of other issues means that telecommunications policy has to be watched on a continuing basis. Quite rightly, the board of a privatised Telstra, even part-privatised, will be looking for opportunities to minimise its non-profitable operations, to minimise its obliga tions which it sees as not being economically relevant. Legislation cannot guarantee that all those obligations affecting rural and regional Australia will be kept in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another issue has been the link between the coalition's environment policy and the sale of Telstra. It has been said by many opposite that this is the greatest environment policy ever. It is also your only environment policy ever. It is also mainly our policy. The fact is that over the last 13 years you have consistently been behind in the policy debate on the environment. Whether it be the Franklin Dam, the Daintree, uranium mining&mdash;you name it&mdash;the coalition has always been right behind the game when it comes to environment policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So now you finally have a policy, but you will not fund it through the usual means. Instead, we have a situation here of policy blackmail and fiscal extortion&mdash;no sale; no policy. When you look at the actual budget situation, which has again been commented on by a number of speakers, and when you look at forward funding estimates and the implementation of our policies prior to the election versus yours, there is a minimal funding difference. What we are really seeing is a cost shifting situation here. We are moving policy and funding commitments off the usual budget into a situation of a one-off sale. The fact is that you do not need to sell Telstra to have an environment policy. That is your choice, and it is a con.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another issue that has come up has been the question: can you sell it? By that I mean that there are grave doubts that the Australian capital markets can absorb it in the sorts of time lines that are undertaken by the government on this issue. That means you may not get the price that the government wants or you may have to wait longer to get it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For a range of circumstances, this legislation ought be opposed. As I have said, you cannot guarantee the community service obligations that are undertaken under this legislation. You cannot have a situation where you can be sure in the future that rural and regional Australia will not be severely hurt. The situation in terms of the cost of services&mdash;whether it be the cost of the phone call, the cost of the connection, the time taken <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="638"> to make that connection or the time taken to ensure that you are up to date with technologies in parts of Australia&mdash;cannot be guaranteed. You can have it in the legislation to an extent, but the fact is that in one year's time, two years time or three years time&mdash;and we have seen it in many other areas, where you have had businesses go into privatisation and be in a situation where they start rolling back their networks away from those sorts of areas&mdash;you see an erosion of services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem with having a private ownership component of Telstra is that you will have a situation where the commitment of those directors will be to try, in all circumstances that are possible to them, to maximise their return for their shareholders. That is fair enough, but something has to give.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know that we will see change tomorrow if this bill goes ahead&mdash;it may not be for some time&mdash;but you will see job losses, and you will see job losses to a greater extent than you would see under a government owned Telstra. You will see a situation where the electronics industry in Australia is severely handicapped because of the movement which will definitely occur of Telstra to source its components overseas. You will see a situation where a range of electronics companies in this country which have come to rely on Telstra as the base to their expansion will see that base disappear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation should be opposed. It should be opposed by all of us because it is bad policy. Its implications for Australians as a whole are bad. Its result for rural and regional Australia will be bad. I urge all of you to oppose this legislation and ensure that we do not have a situation where a major national asset, which performs a crucial role for Australian society, is destroyed and frittered away as a result of this privatisation measure.</PARA></SPEECH>

That is an extraordinary remark to be made by a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> member of the opposition. It is an extraordinary remark to be made simply because the representatives of rural and regional Australia are here on this side of the parliament. It is the representatives of rural and regional Australia that are backing this sale.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind both the parliamentary secretary and the member for Bruce that it is the National Farmers Federation, the group that represent regional and rural Australia, who have said, `This is the right course for us to take.' I stand here as the representative of a regional seat, and I stand here as a representative of a seat&mdash;as, indeed, the Deputy Speaker does&mdash;that is dependent on the community service obligations in order to have its communication needs met. I would not tolerate this piece of legislation if it disadvantaged my constituents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If that were not of itself a persuasive argument, given that I am joined in this debate by the National Party as well, let me say this to the opposition: the minister responsible for this piece of legislation represents a rural and regional seat himself. He has no desire to see the communication facilities available to his constituents reduced in any way at all. I am very pleased that the minister is in the chamber. The minister is the one whose electoral responsibility includes King Island&mdash;</PARA>

Other regional members would not want to know it, the National Party would not want to know it, the National Farmers Federation would not want to know it and the minister would not want to be identified with it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> After listening to this debate, one could be forgiven for thinking that the government was standing here proposing the sale of Telstra. I must be fair to the member for Bruce. He was very objective in his analysis and referred to the partial sale of Telstra. But not all of his <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="639"> colleagues have been as honourable in their participation in the debate. We are talking about the partial sale of a government asset. We are talking about a sale that will limit individual foreign ownership to 1.667 per cent&mdash;that is, five per cent of the non-Commonwealth equity in Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Criticism is coming from people who have themselves not only proposed but also executed the sale of other major Commonwealth assets, such as the Commonwealth Bank, Qantas and the Federal Airports Corporation. Those sales, not conditional on a partial sale, were made by the now opposition when in government without any reference to the people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Bruce went on to say that he supposed, as former opposition members had supposed, that this partial sale would be followed by further sales of parts of Telstra&mdash;forgetting the government's commitment not to proceed with any further sale of Telstra without first seeking the approval of the people of Australia by referendum or election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The facts are that this is not a sale that places my electorate or my constituents at risk. But the other thing to be borne in mind&mdash;and the other point I would want to make on the comments from the member for Bruce&mdash;is that while the focus has been on this sale, as if the sale of Telstra were the only technique that the opposition had to fund its environment package, the opposition has conveniently forgotten that the motive for this sale is not funding the environment package but sorting out the economy that it inherited. The motive for this sale is to give the Australian economy an opportunity to be refreshed, a breather.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are too many opposition members who too conveniently forget that during their period in government we saw this nation become increasingly less competitive. For example, from 1975 to 1988, when the now government had stewardship of the national books, we never recorded a current account deficit in excess of $1 billion. Out of the 150 months recorded from 1983 to 1995, when the now opposition had stewardship of the national books, on 96 occasions the current account deficit was over $1 billion. In fact, on 11 <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> occasions it was over $2 billion. That was a measure of real economic failure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of that economic failure, our national income per capita and our position on the world scale of national income per capita slipped from 10th to 22nd. The economy is not something the now opposition can be proud of. The situation we have inherited has obliged this sale to allow us to address the fundamental economic problems we face.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the member for Bruce was making his contribution, the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) interjected and suggested that since I was following in the debate as a South Australian I would have an interest in drawing a parallel between the sale of Telstra and the sale of SA Water. The reality, of course, is that the member for Batman was quite wrong. SA Water has not been sold by the South Australian government. In fact, SA Water has sold nothing more than the service delivery. The South Australian government retains the ownership of all of the capital assets of SA Water and all that has been sold is the service delivery.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It absolutely does in SA Water terms, yes. The motivation behind the sale of Telstra is not simply to address the debt. There is also the question, as everyone has acknowledged, of what we do about the environment. Professor John Lovering, when <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="640"> addressing the Murray-Darling Association in Broken Hill late last year, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you want to pick a fight in rural Australia, forget woodchipping, greenies and dole bludgers. If you want a blue, talk about water.</PARA>
<PARA>The real issue concerning rural Australia is the supply of water, particularly in a drought. Ask the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson), who hails from Queensland, about the experience Queenslanders have had&mdash;or indeed you, Mr Deputy Speaker Truss&mdash;over the last five years. The experiences have been all too dramatically changed in much of Queensland over the last week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For most Australian rural producers, the key issue is the supply of water&mdash;and the supply of quality water. Nowhere is that more marked than in my own South Australian electorate. I have most of the key irrigation areas in South Australia in my electorate. I recognise, as the member for Murray (Mrs Stone) said in her maiden speech, the importance of the Murray-Darling Basin system to the supply of fruit and vegetables in Australia. What is happening across the Murray-Darling Basin system, as everyone in this House is aware and as every Australian is now aware, is that there has been a deterioration that cannot be allowed to continue. The document <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Saving our national heritage</EMPHASIS> states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One-third of the nation's output from rural industries originates in the Basin, of which three billion is derived from irrigation. Irrigation accounts for more than 95 per cent of the water diverted from the river systems in the Basin.</PARA>
<PARA>The problem is that salinity in rivers and streams is increasing alarmingly. Algal blooms are more frequent and severe, water quality is continuing to decline and wetlands and river flora have suffered. Agricultural loss as a result of the impact of salinity in the Murray-Darling Basin is calculated at $260 million per annum&mdash;an astonishing cost. It is a cost that has reflected the degeneration of the Murray-Darling Basin system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government proposes to do something about it by addressing what we do with the River Murray. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said in response to a question at question time two days ago that in six out of every 10 years the Murray effectively flows in a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> drought situation because of the amount of water that is now diverted out of the Murray and not replenished in some way. Under natural circumstances the drought flows would have been one in 20. As a government, the coalition proposes, aided by the Telstra sale, to direct $163 million to a Murray-Darling 2001 project to do something about the standard of water available to Murray irrigators, to New South Welshmen, to South Australians in general, and also to Victorians, particularly in the Sunraysia area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a critical program. Every Murray-Darling irrigator, every South Australian, is dependent on the quality of the water delivered from the Murray-Darling into their homes. Take, for example, the member for Grey (Mr Wakelin). In his electorate, were it not for the diversion of River Murray water to the city of Whyalla there would be no industry; and, in 1996, it is probably fair to say there would be nothing more than a small town in the now city of Whyalla. My state depends on quality water from the Murray-Darling Basin. It depends totally on it and so do the key industries in which I have participated and which I represent as the member for Wakefield.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much has been done, even by the former government, to in some way improve the quality of River Murray water. I am very conscious, for example, of the Woolpunda scheme where $27 million was allocated solely to identify underground saline flows which occurred in the Murray-Darling Basin and which had little to do with irrigation but a great deal to do with the fact that the area was once an inland sea. As a result of 26 tube wells being placed along the Murray-Darling Basin and intercepting these highly saline flows which had come from all over northern New South Wales&mdash;because this was once an inland sea&mdash;salinity at Morgan in South Australia was reduced by eight per cent. That was a step in the right direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note that the water intercepted by those tube wells and directed out to an evaporation basin has probably never been seen by the human eye and certainly never by the European eye until it comes out of the pipe into the evaporation <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="641"> basin. That is because it is water that fell as rainwater or existed there as inland seawater certainly before Europeans and possibly before human habitation of this great island. This scheme is picking up these saline flows going into the Murray-Darling Basin and diverting them. As a result of the scheme funded by the previous government, salinity has improved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, as anyone who knows anything about the Murray-Darling Basin can attest, the grim reality is that, with the demands we are placing on the basin as a result of expanded agricultural practice, principally in cotton but now to a large degree in wine grape production, and as a result of the drainage water that has accumulated, that eight per cent improvement is quickly lost with the demands that the Australian population is putting on this food bowl. Hence the need for a major program. Hence the need to allocate $163 million to continually improve the status of the Murray-Darling Basin. This is an allocation that cannot responsibly occur unless we generate the funds to make it happen, and those funds can only be generated out of the partial sale&mdash;and I emphasise `partial sale'&mdash;of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the government stands here proud of what it proposes to do. It proposes to maintain an essential Australian asset&mdash;still available to Australians, still recognising its community service obligations, still ensuring that the Flinders Island constituents of the member for Bass, the minister at the table, will have the same access to not only their existing telephone services but also improved ones&mdash;and still be able as a result of that sale to both improve the national economy and do something about the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister has made it perfectly clear that he will set up what has been called a Natural Heritage Trust and that out of that trust $318 million will be allocated to a national vegetation initiative and 250,000 hectares of ground per annum will be revegetated. With all of the problems that the Murray-Darling Basin faces, the best way to deal with the surplus water currently occurring in the Murray-Darling Basin&mdash;as the result, in many instances, of drainage run&hyphen;off that is not being picked up&mdash;is not to put in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> pumps as a way of intercepting that water but to plant trees, because day and night, without consuming fossil fuels, those trees provide a pump to lower the saline water levels. Hence the importance of the Natural Heritage Trust and the importance of the revegetation program proposed by the Prime Minister and to be funded by the legislation currently being considered in the House. I think the minister ought to be commended for the role he has played in putting this package to the House and making it available for real debate and consideration by all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On that note, I will make my final point. The member for Bruce, along with many opposite, has made much of the fact, as he saw it, that we, the government, could not claim a mandate for this particular action. It is self&hyphen;evident in this chamber that we can claim a mandate, but the member for Bruce has suggested that in the other chamber people had taken out an insurance policy by which we could claim no mandate at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was conveniently forgetting the statistics made available to every Australian by Malcolm Mackerras, who, looking at the Senate result from the 2 March 1996 election, pointed out that 40 senators went to the polls and 20&mdash;a half, would you believe&mdash;were returned as members of the Liberal or National parties. That hardly leaves a mandate for anyone else in their own right. I rest my case. A half were returned as members of the Liberal and National parties. Forget about this chamber, we are reflecting on the Senate. Fourteen were returned as members of the Australian Labor Party, five as members of the Australian Democrats and one as a Tasmanian Green.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I put this question to the House: what did the majority of Australians vote for? The simple, inescapable truth is that the majority of them voted for the Liberal and National parties, for this program and for a commitment that we have to the partial sale of Telstra and the consequent simultaneous tidy up of the economy and the environment. I commend the minister on this legislation, and commend it to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<ELECTORATE> (Newcastle)</ELECTORATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(7.01 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, at the outset I offer my congratulations to you, the Second <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="642"> Deputy Speaker and the Speaker on your elevations to your positions. We should talk a little bit about the election and what its result implies. We have heard an awful lot of nonsense and discussion about mandates. I wonder whether all Victorian members should vote against this legislation, because the majority of Victorians voted against the Liberal Party at the election. In fact, the opposition out&hyphen;polled the Liberal Party in Victoria. So, on the reckoning of those opposite, all Victorian members of this House should vote with us. That seems to be the way the opposition want to play it. That is their idea about mandate. The fact is that the majority of Australians voted against the government in both houses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have spent some years in this chamber listening to those who are now opposite lecturing and hectoring us in government about how we had no mandate. Everything we tried to do they opposed, undermined and used their numbers in the other place. They did not come in here with the pious posturing that we are seeing now. It is absolutely amazing. But it is not surprising when you consider it is coming from honest John and his friends.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those who are here for the first time may be a bit puzzled by this change in attitude. My friend the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) does not surprise me, because he has always had the capacity to be all things to all people. Now, of course, he is playing the pompous posturer. He is talking about a mandate, knowing as well as I do that he spent the years on this side of the House arguing the opposite case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also hearing a massive campaign of lies. I find it amazing. The word `lies' is parliamentary. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) used it the other afternoon on three occasions and was not stopped once by the Speaker. So I accept that the word has been used in this chamber by the leader of the government since the election with no opposition from the Speaker. He used the term quite specifically, not even generally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The lies that have been propagated about the opposition policy and its attitudes on Telstra are mind boggling. There is the issue <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the budget deficit. It is very clear that the government put forward proposals which were $4 billion short of funding. They made a promise that they would keep all their promises. They even promised that they would go into deficit rather than break those promises. That is the first promise broken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that they are $4 billion short of funds for the policies they put forward. The Treasury estimates that have come forward are based on current government policy. The idea that Treasury costed the policies of the former government is a nonsense. They costed the current government's policies. As we have seen, those policies require a downturn. Access Economics have pointed out, as has almost every other commentator, that there will be anything from a 0.3 per cent to a 0.7 per cent drop in growth in the current year alone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Treasury factored those estimates into the projections for the next budget, as it has to do. If it is factoring in our policies, with the accord in place and with lower wage growth, there would have been a different budget bottom line. Firstly, there is the $4 billion shortfall, which was fabricated by the opposition in terms of its costings. Secondly, the difference is made by government policies in slowing growth and increasing unemployment in the short to medium terms, and God knows for how long.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The idea that somehow they can persuade the Australian people that this country is in dreadful shape is not on. Their attempt to demonise the opposition for what they have inherited is just a joke. People out there know that inflation is low, wage growth is low and employment growth has been enormously high. They are watching very carefully now. I note with great interest that, since the election, there has been no outburst of spending by the government. In fact, it has been the opposite situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Going further, what the government has done to the national capital is appalling. Any government which deliberately suspends a whole city, a national capital, of this size for four months of absolute uncertainty for political gain&mdash;simply to back load the redundancy packages into the current budget&mdash;is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="643"> disgraceful. What the government has done is very simple. Packages are available until 30 June for those who want to retire. The cost of those packages will be measured against the previous government's budget. This attempt to shift the budget figure in the 1995&hyphen;96 budget is disgraceful and immoral.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rather than making a decision about what they are doing, they are spreading that over four months, from now right through until budget night. So the whole of Canberra is frozen for four months. Why? Because the government want to back load a few hundred million dollars into this year's budget. That is a shabby, squalid little trick.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about the debt question? The fact is that debts relate to assets. The issue at stake does not relate simply to the size of the debt. It also relates to the value of the asset held and to the capacity to service the debt. Does the government suggest that this generation should pay now for everything&mdash;the roads, the public utilities and infrastructure that will last for decades&mdash;in cash so that the next generation inherits all those assets without contributing towards them? Is that the idea&mdash;that somehow debt is intrinsically wrong? If so I have never heard that put forward in that way before. The government has not argued that. It did not say that during the election campaign. It has not articulated that kind of a thesis. The fact is that each generation in a society pays a share of what it uses. It is important that the assets and infrastructure we pass to future generations are in good shape&mdash;but not that they are necessarily debt&hyphen;free, because the debt is part of the asset. What matters is the relationship between the value of the asset and the debt and the capacity to service that debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The idea that this issue is about getting the debt down is suspect. It is even more suspect because what they are going to save is the interest on the debt. What is that? Five per cent? Six per cent? Seven per cent? Eight per cent? The fact is that the $8 billion that will be gained from the sale is currently earning about 14 per cent. Why would you retire debt and save seven per cent when what you are retiring is currently earning you 14 per cent?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember very well the unctuous lecture from the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) yesterday about how economically literate he was. He was trying to justify the better value of retiring the debt. He forgot the return on the asset the government wants to flog. The $8 billion asset it wants to sell will return more to the people of Australia if they own it. I have heard with great amusement the idea that somehow we should share this wonderful golden goose with all the battlers, who will all want their little share of it. The fact is that they have a share of it now, and it is earning them 14 per cent. Those opposite want to flog it off to someone else and save seven per cent. These are the economic gurus, the leading lights of the next century, who are supposed to be putting Australia on the right path.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This policy came up about 10 years ago in 1987. Those opposite have been talking about it in various forms at various times, at various elections. Suddenly it has come forward now to solve a deficit problem in the current budget. What a lot of gobbledegook. Telstra has a $15 billion a year turnover. It is a business which plays an enormously important role in this country. We have already heard that it pays $650 million a year in taxation. It is one of the genuine corporate taxpayers; it observes the spirit of the law because the government says it has to, because the government can make it do so. Take away section 3 in the legislation, under which the minister can direct Telstra to act in the national interests, and we lose the capacity to make sure it observes the spirit of corporate taxation. Telstra plays an important role as a corporate model for taxation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra pays another $300 million a year in other taxes&mdash;rates, state taxes and payroll taxes. It pays more than a billion in dividends. That is the type of organisation we are talking about&mdash;not some run-down and ineffective bureaucratic department. I mentioned earlier the role Telstra plays in corporate taxation. The member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) quoted the report of the inquiry of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology into government purchasing. The members for Indi (Mr Lieberman) and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="644"> Bendigo (Mr Reid) both took part in that inquiry. We went through the various departments and the effects of government purchasing and the role played by Telstra. Telstra expects to spend about $10 billion in the next five years in Australia. Talk to the companies that Telstra buys from and they will say that without government policy pushing Telstra to do so it would not be happening. They could buy cheaper and nastier somewhere else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our high&hyphen;tech exports have gone from about $50 million to almost $1 billion a year. Telstra has driven that. Telstra is an arm of government. It can be directed by express government policy. More than 90 per cent of its purchases are made in Australia. Seventy per cent of its high&hyphen;tech purchases are made in Australia. There would be no Australian telecommunications industry if Telstra were not government owned. Go around the world and ask and you will find someone who will sell the products Telstra needs for a cheaper price. Why would a private company with a responsibility to its shareholders not buy the cheapest product? Why should it observe government policy? Of course, it cannot. When overseas, I am asked, as I am sure other members are asked, why small pockets of population are scattered all over this vast continent&mdash;on the east coast, in the west, up north.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra's technology has been world class for a very long time, yet when we came to government in 1983 Telstra was not able to go overseas. We had to pass special legislation, which eventually got through in 1984. There was not much cooperation then to allow Telstra to go and sell overseas. Ericsson&mdash;the great shining light of the previous government&mdash;was established in Australia to supply to Telstra. I thought that was a wonderful thing until I went there in 1983 and discovered that Ericsson Australia was not allowed to sell outside Australasia and New Guinea. Ericsson Sweden supplied Asia, not Ericsson Australia. It was all wrong. The design and  the methodology indicated the previous government's inability to understand the capacity of Telecom to drive Australian industry, to be a player in a bigger game than just the domestic scene, to project into trade. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> We are talking about a large, dynamic organisation that has been incredibly successful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us talk about the sale of Telstra. I noticed that section 3 of the legislation, which relates to ministerial discretion to direct Telstra in the national interests, goes. In other words, under this legislation Telstra cannot be directed to act in the national interests. The price capping on its charges applies for only as long as the current disallowable instrument&mdash;that is, 1997 on the current policy. We know nothing beyond then because no policy has been articulated. It has been proposed but we are still in a vacuum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some interesting words used in the legislation, which are quite meaningful when you have ministerial power to direct in the national interest the universal service obligations to ensure access to standard telephones. The key words are `on an equitable basis'. Those opposite are going to start finding out that people in Melbourne or Sydney will not think it is equitable that they are subsidising the bush. The fact is that they outnumber everybody else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Optus will not put cable into Dungog, why should Telstra keep cable there? Is that equitable? It is not simply a question of access to services; it is a question of the services being maintained there. Watching the withdrawal of the Commonwealth Bank, as mentioned by previous speakers, is nothing compared to Telstra because, very simply, Telstra can use mobile technology. It puts in a simple transmitter and everyone goes on to mobile phones, from which calls are timed. Time charges do not affect mobile phones.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, it will be very nice in your electorate. You will have access to mobile telephones. Why keep the cables running? Why upgrade the cables? You will not need to as it is not equitable. They cannot be made to. The mobile charges that your constituents have will be the same mobile charges as the charges in Melbourne and Sydney, and so they should be. That is the answer. I do not think you people understand where technology has got to. We are looking towards a world where digital technology will be universal. It can be broadbanded and it is all timed.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="645">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The little travesty in here of a clause about timed charges is a furphy, and you know it because your advisers are not stupid. You may be technologically illiterate, but they are not. Two million Australians are already using mobile phones. By the end of the century that will have almost trebled. Once your technology has got to that level, the bush will go mobile and we will all be timed. Don't you dare suggest that I am telling lies or being misleading because that is what is going to happen and you know it.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also fascinating to look at the question of foreign debt. One of the big issues of the last election was the mandate about foreign debt. Who gave you a mandate to increase it by $3 billion? That is what you have done. Your foreign sales of $2.8 billion will be by debt. You know the trick; you know the system. Establish an Australian company. It borrows from its parents offshore. It brings the money in as a loan and then buys the shares. They all do it, or haven't you noticed? That is what the foreign debt is about. It buys equity and assets through Australian companies which have borrowed off their parent company or subsidiary overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not just the ownership of Telstra that is involved. You are about to increase foreign debt by $3 billion and you walk around the countryside talking about how dreadful we were for allowing the foreign debt to blow out when you are deliberately and consciously doing it. What kind of chicanery is that? Truth is all. Truth is absolute. This fortnight we have seen the most disgraceful display of slipping and sliding, walking away from, avoiding and misleading that I have seen in a long time from people who put to us in this chamber not many months ago that truth was <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> absolute. I have seen very little truth in this fortnight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, I pointed out to you that those in your own constituency and those in rural and regional Australia, who I am close to, are going to be the victims of this. They are facing a shift in services. The government cannot direct Telstra to maintain a service that is no longer economically viable and where the hardware is out of date. Telstra is putting in the most modern technology available, which will be mobile technology. That is equitable, fair and accessible. It meets all the criteria and it is all timed. Who decides the rental charges? Not Telstra, but somebody else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An unbelievable hypocritical action is going on in here. I feel a bit sorry for those opposite who have come into this parliament for the first time because they actually believe a lot of this stuff. They think that what they are being told is accurate, genuine and honest. They are in for an awful shock if this legislation gets passed. Let us debate it up and down the country. Let us go around Australia talking about this topic. I think Australians will see through you. You have no mandate. You have a mandate to govern and nothing else. If you took mandates seriously, you would have voted differently over the last 12 years. Let us debate this issue up and down Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I visited many workplaces during the election campaign to talk to workers about a wide range of issues. One issue that was always raised with me was the sale of Telstra. I told them, just as I told every voter in Throsby during my campaign, that I would oppose the sale of Telstra. Today, like my colleagues, I fulfil that promise, that solemn commitment, I gave to the people of Throsby. Bear in mind that I was one of the few on this side who had an increase in their primary vote, which was probably because of my very strong opposition to the privatisation of Telstra. I oppose the Telstra privatisation legislation because it is contrary to the interests of the employees of this telecommunications machine, the taxpayers of Australia and the consumers of the telecommunications services in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the last couple of days there has been a lot of talk in this chamber about Labor's support when in government for the privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas. While I never agreed with these decisions made by the previous government, Telstra is in a different set of circumstances. I listened to the contribution made by the member for Lowe (Mr Zammit) this morning. He said that no-one publicly, privately or in the caucus&mdash;and I do not know how he knows what went on in our caucus as he was not even a member of this parliament&mdash;opposed the privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank or Qantas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I made many public statements on the issue and I suggest that he read my appropriation bill speech delivered from that side of the House on 30 May 1995&mdash;incidentally, my birthday. It is on page 596 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekly </EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. In that speech, at some personal cost to myself but with an electoral bonus, I very strongly criticised the party, the government, for its sale of the Commonwealth Bank and the privatisation of Qantas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As many people would know&mdash;and they have heard me say this ad nauseam in my speeches&mdash;I have always opposed the sale of ANL. I have always been very public in my statements and, again, I will have another opportunity tomorrow to restate that. For those on the government side who are saying <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that no members on this side opposed privatisation when we were in government, I suggest they have a look at our record. Some of us on this side have always been opposed to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I vividly remember one ad which was shown during the recent election campaign. I must say I thought it was one of the best ads from the Liberal Party. The advertisement appeared on regional and rural television networks. It flashed up on the television a photograph of the local Labor Party member of parliament, whoever that member might have been, and then came the voice&hyphen;over with a message about some sin which the local Labor member, in their view, had committed by voting on legislation of the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One such ad was in Gilmore. Up would come a photograph of the former member for Gilmore, Peter Knott, and the voice would come over and say, `Did you vote for tax rises, did you vote for this or did you vote for that?' Then there would be a big sign that said no and the photograph of Peter would come up and it would say, `But Peter Knott did,' and then some other thing would be stamped across his face. Come the next election there will be quite a few government members who will be kept accountable by those on this side of the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to transgress a little bit by mentioning names here instead of just the electorate. There will be a few more of those ads running in the lead&hyphen;up to the next election. For example, we are going to see the big screen and the smiling face of the current member for Gilmore (Mrs Gash) with a voice&hyphen;over saying, `Did you vote for Telstra to be sold off? No? Well, Joanna Gash did. Did you vote for a reduction in service quality of your telephone service? No? Well, Joanna Gash did.' Members opposite will be held accountable for their vote on this legislation, let there be no doubt about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sale of Telstra will deliver no national benefit. It will have a negative impact on both public finances and the quality and price of telecommunications services to residential customers. Of particular concern is the downgrading of this parliament's support for and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="647"> commitment to providing a universal service for all Australians. Until the introduction of the legislation, it did not matter where you lived. All Australians, be they in the cities, the bush or the provincial centres, were treated the same in the provision of basic telephone services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This universal service was covered by the adherence to universal rental charges, universal installation costs, universal call rates, universal service charges and universal untimed local calls. But by passing this Telstra privatisation legislation this parliament is downgrading that longstanding commitment. The commitment is downgraded by these words on page 48 of the bill:</PARA>

<PARA>With the addition of these words to the Telecommunications Act 1991 it is clear that the universal service obligations of Telstra will be linked to the definition of efficiency and economical. We on this side oppose this qualification in the legislation. The universal service obligation, which this parliament is committed to, does not specify a qualification in the provision of this service. There is no choice. It is a condition to be fulfilled&mdash;no ifs, no buts, no maybes. That is the way it should remain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We oppose private owners and foreign owners of Telstra being given the opportunity to ignore the universal service obligations. It is simply not good enough for these people, in the overall assessment, to declare that the universal service obligation is not, in the words of the bill, efficient and economical. As a result, they will not fund it. The provisions on page 48 of the bill allow the private and foreign owners of Telstra to do that. It is a provision which should not stand and will not stand, or we will not accept it on this side of the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The universal service obligations of Telstra should not be linked to pure financial considerations, especially not in a land which is so diverse and which has population centres <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in the bush, the provincial centres and the cities. By linking efficiency and economics to Telstra's universal service obligations, the legislation allows private owners and foreign investors to also downgrade their commitment to the people in rural and regional Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to speak about paedophiles, but firstly I want to say that I think all members support the initiatives for a national approach to child abuse announced by Minister Moylan and that it would have bipartisan support. But I believe that if you have a national approach to this subject, you cannot quarantine the department of immigration's involvement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year, as the chairman of the Human Rights Subcommittee, I wrote to then Minister Bolkus asking specifically what protection was offered for overseas children who were sponsored to Australia to undertake studies at schools, boarding schools and TAFEs. I got a response that I was disappointed with. Basically, the department is saying that they only have to satisfy themselves about the bone fides of the student status of those children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that advice proffered to the then minister&mdash;I have also written to Minister Ruddock&mdash;is seriously flawed. The Immigration (Guardianship of Children) Act 1946 is still in force. Section 6 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister shall be the guardian of the person, and of the estate in Australia, of every non-citizen child who arrives in Australia after the commencement of this Act to the exclusion of the father and mother and every other guardian of the child, and shall have, as guardian, the same rights, powers, duties, obligations and liabilities as a natural guardian of the child would have, until the child reaches the age of 18 years or leaves Australia permanently, or until provisions of this Act cease to apply to and in relation to the child, whichever first happens. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="648"> </PARA>
<PARA>The department is suggesting that subsection 4AA(1) negates this overall responsibility that the minister directly has. But I contend on reading it&mdash;I have had it subsequently confirmed&mdash;that it only limits the minister's powers in relation to children who are intended to become permanent residents of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not good enough for the minister and the department to say that they have no direct responsibility when the minister himself under this act still in force has sole responsibility in guardianship of all these children. I do not think anyone in this House could be satisfied that the department of immigration will not open its files, will not detect those who are sponsoring multiple students and refuses to have any officers of the department directly investigate cases of paedophilia. I think this is absolutely disgraceful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the minister or the department has an advice from the Attorney-General suggesting that my interpretation is wrong, then let them table it in this parliament. But let us not walk away from the prime responsibility of the immigration department and the minister. If their interpretation is right, let us put an amendment into the act to delete 4AA(1) so that the original intention of the act, passed in 1946, makes abundantly clear the minister's and the department's direct responsibility for these overseas children who are, as we know through the royal commission inquiry and other things, victims of paedophiles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, if Australian children are powerless, just imagine how much more powerless poor families from Fiji or India are. I seek leave to table my correspondence to the then minister for immigration, Senator Bolkus, and to Minister Ruddock, and Senator Bolkus's reply.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One week ago, last Wednesday, I rose for the first time to speak in this place. In doing so, I brought to the attention of the House the devastating impact the drought had been having on many farmers in Australia, in particular those in my part of the electorate, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Brisbane and Lockyer valleys. Unfortunately, since that time&mdash;in fact, within 48 hours of having brought that to the notice of the House&mdash;the same people have been inflicted by flood. It certainly shows the vagaries of nature and what can happen. However, there are a few points I would like to bring to the attention of the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The pictures that came out of this area, Laidley and Esk, were very much of the business community as water entered the main street and took over a couple of hotels, with a couple of feet of water in each one, as well as a few businesses. About 30 houses were also inundated with water. What does not make good pictures is the farming land that has been destroyed and the houses and lives of those people that have been destroyed&mdash;along with their incomes for the next six months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make mention of this because, whilst it is always very difficult for anybody to experience a natural disaster, particularly a flood, the devastating and long-term effects of those that have been affected on the land should never be underestimated. Whilst the pictures on the television showed the hotels with the water on the floor, the fact is that within 24 hours they were trading again and their income was stable. The farmers, on the other hand, having endured five years of drought and having received some rain in January, took the plunge and went beyond any debt regime they had previously run up because they finally did have water. Having looked towards the good times and planting some 9,000 cauliflowers each week&mdash;or 12,000 broccoli or whatever else they might have had on their properties&mdash;they now find themselves with the whole crop destroyed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem they now face, after five years of drought and now with a devastating flood, is that they do not have any income for the next six months. They do not have any other means of relief in the form of loans, even though the state government has come to the party there. If they are to continue on the land and continue to be the salad bowl of Brisbane, these two regions of the Brisbane and Lockyer valleys are going to need far greater assistance. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="649">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I welcome both Mick Veivers, the Minister for Emergency Services in the Queensland state government, and the Premier, Rob Borbidge, going out to the area and offering their support&mdash;the area has been declared a natural disaster zone&mdash;but it is going to take a lot more than that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to bring to the House's attention one particular example of a family whose son was about to return to the land. That family have been on their property for 70&hyphen;odd years. The family are broke but, like most of our farming community, will see things through to the bitter end. Unfortunately, tonight&mdash;and I have just got off the phone to this family&mdash;that family do not know where to turn. Theirs is just one of many properties in the same predicament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that Australia realises that, whilst rain may have a medium&hyphen; and long&hyphen;term beneficial effect in these areas, there are many families who have struggled for many years and who are now going to go to the wall. It behoves all of us in this place to be aware of that, and I will certainly be making representations to the appropriate ministers to see what additional actions we can take as a parliament to support the state government in its endeavours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These areas are already beset by extremely high unemployment. They have all the other problems that Australia has endured over the last 13 years, and now, with these natural disasters, I fear that many of them are not going to be able to continue. I feel it is important that I bring this information to the House's attention. I assure the people in the Brisbane and Lockyer valleys that I will do my absolute best to ensure that this parliament and the state parliament do everything in their power to support them in their greatest hour of need.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this place tonight to express the concerns of the people of Namadgi and, hence, the people of the Australian Capital Territory. The effects of this government's policies in relation to the public sector are proving disastrous for this territory. Of course, it is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not only the ACT that is suffering or that will suffer from this. Service delivery and the type of society we want in this country&mdash;all of that&mdash;are under threat. But, given today's rally by the Public Sector Union outside this place and given that my electorate is in this territory, I want to specifically address the local implications.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effect of these policies on Canberra is dramatic. Forty&hyphen;eight per cent of our work force is employed in the public sector. That is quite understandable, because Canberra is the national capital. It is the seat of government. We need to continue to remind ourselves of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much has been said by those opposite and their supporters about how we, in putting these facts forward, are talking down Canberra. Nothing could be further from the truth. To say that is to shoot the messenger. The people of the ACT are extremely worried. They are scared and they have little faith in the future. Frankly, most of them today do not know whether they will have a job tomorrow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a rather prophetic joke going around this town at the moment and it is this: what is the definition of optimism? A public servant who irons five shirts&mdash;or could I say five blouses&mdash;on a Sunday night. Their concern is really understandable and should not be disregarded. This government said again and again in the recent election campaign that only 2,500 jobs would be lost through natural attrition&mdash;no more&mdash;no matter what.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the recent election campaign the former liberal member for Canberra went around this town not only promising a limit on the job cuts but also giving misleading promises and saying that our unemployed youth would have increased opportunity for employment in the public sector. How deceitful&mdash;and it is such a vulnerable group to mislead. But he was only saying what he was told to say. I do not really think he believed that propaganda at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="650"> What is going to happen to the young people in the ACT? With the local Liberal government instituting a recruitment freeze and holding to that recruitment freeze in their public sector and the federal Liberal govern ment cutting jobs and cutting back spending in the IT industry, where are the jobs going to come from? The private sector in the ACT is simply not able to employ all these new job seekers overnight, no matter how genuine their efforts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be a very sad day for this city if our kids and families had to start thinking about leaving in order to maintain some sort of economic and employment future. Already in excess of 10,000 job cuts across the public sector have been announced and this is before the Audit Commission reports, before the budget and before the Industry Commission's recommendations on privatising and contracting out are announced and enacted. And you wonder why the ACT community is reacting the way it is! Believe me, any trust, any honesty that the other side was claiming can be forgotten. You can give it away. Your gross dishonesty is absolute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) came in here today and told us in the ACT to calm down, telling us of the successful meeting he had today with the ACT Liberal Chief Minister and ACT business leaders. `Everything will be okay,' he said. How dare he! Why is it then that the business community is taking out full&hyphen;page ads in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> in an attempt to encourage confidence&mdash;something I congratulate them for and wish them well with? We in this town have to collectively do all we can in the ACT to counter this government's attack on and disregard for our local community.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Monday night the shadow minister for the environment, the honourable member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence), spoke in her contribution to the address&hyphen;in&hyphen;reply debate about the opposition to mining at Kakadu. In fact, she spent most of her time allotted for that debate telling us in this House why we should not be mining uranium in Kakadu. To say that where the mines are situated at the moment&mdash;the Ranger mine and Koongara, another mine on the Jabiluka site&mdash;are part of the park is like saying that Canberra is part of New South Wales. Talking about the size of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the park, I would like to highlight the distance. If you draw a line from Sydney to Bathurst and then to Newcastle&mdash;that is a pretty large area&mdash;and visualise that all you are going to mine in that area is one football oval, then any impact on the pristine condition of the park would appear to be unlikely.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">ERA at Ranger has one of the best environmental records in the world in mining operations. It has a very good record. Since 1979 Aboriginal communities in that area have received nearly $150 million in royalties. Yet the honourable member for Fremantle said that there was no real direct benefit for those communities and that they were very divided as to whether other mining should take place in that region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can assure the honourable member for Fremantle that the Northern Land Council and the traditional owners are very interested in having discussions with mining companies about mining in that particular area, provided that stringent environmental controls are put in place and provided the Aboriginal community want mining, and there is no reason why it should not proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems that mining at Roxby Downs is all right. Even though we have the capacity in the Northern Territory for at least three mines, obviously the other uranium mines were not all right but a political decision was made by the Labor Party to allow the Roxby Downs site to go ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This country will need valuable exports because we owe $180 billion. We can create additional resources through exports of uranium and other goods. As I said the other day, $1.64 billion worth of exports came out of the Northern Territory in l994&hyphen;95, which represents one per cent of the population producing two per cent of the GDP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Jabiluka will be the first site to go ahead, provided the environmental impact statement is approved by the minister. It is an underground mine that would not be visible from the road, and there is a 20&hyphen;kilometre road linking it to the mine at Jabiru. People visiting the area would not see that operation; there would be no interference. The honourable member for Fremantle made the point last night about 30 jobs&mdash;I believe there are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="651"> more than 30 jobs in that province&mdash;affecting something like 5,000 jobs in that area. But the mine site at Jabiluka, with its underground facility and the road into Ranger, will not impact on the area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you have ever been to Kakadu you would know that the park is quite large and that there are very many sites of significance in various areas of it. One in particular that the road would go past is Obiri Rock, which is probably one of the best attractions in the park and the one closest to the mine site. Neither I nor some environmentalists believe that mining of uranium in that area will affect the park. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I was interested in the response the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) made last week to comments made by the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) relating to advertising material circulated in his electorate during the election campaign. The Prime Minister indicated that he had not authorised the use of the words in that material, that he was very angry about it, and that he made those views known to the Western Australian division of the Liberal Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of my standing this evening is to ask the President of the Western Australian Liberal Party how on earth he can tolerate the blatant fraud perpetrated during the campaign in the seat of Moore. As the Prime Minister indicated, there was a clearly misleading use of some of his own words in the advertising material in an attempt to denigrate the candidature of the member for Curtin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Curtin and I were both attacked using quite fraudulent or misleading lines about our role in the parliament. That is something an editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> described as `blatantly dishonest'. In my electorate we had the extensive use of push&hyphen;polling both before and after the preselection for the Liberal seat of Moore. There was defamation at the doorstop&mdash;campaign workers going to doorstops and making clearly defamatory comments about me, comments that were repeated back to me by the persons <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> concerned who were quite distressed by the behaviour of these people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had the stealing of signs. In fact, a person charged with stealing my signs was found to be a campaign worker for my Liberal opponent. He was later convicted of the offence and required to pay restitution for the signs that he had damaged when he was stealing them. In the last week of the campaign we had a quite extraordinary event. The candidate was discovered at about 2 o'clock in the morning knocking in signs outside a house in my electorate. He was discovered by a women who was suffering from cancer and who was awoken by this noise in the street. When she went out to complain she was told that he was perfectly within his rights to do so and he carried on knocking them in. I might say that she also commented that several of my signs which had been up when she had gone to bed were then on the ground while his signs were up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I really did not want to dwell on that because what I am really concerned about is the fact that in this campaign there was the use of something which actually breaches the Electoral Act, and that is the production of dirt sheets. Dirt sheets were circulated to every household in the electorate under the title the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Moore Report</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Moore Report</EMPHASIS> was authorised by a person called Glen Crook&mdash;interesting name&mdash;of 284 Walcott Street, Menora, and printed by Swanweb, 102 Bannister Road, Canning Vale. We could not locate Mr Crook to find out exactly who he was. The document was circulated as purportedly being an independent third party sheet, supposedly informing people about issues in the Moore campaign. It became more interesting when the second edition appeared.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The March edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Moore Report</EMPHASIS> contained a number of other defamatory comments. It was an interesting one because it purported to be authorised by an M. Nagi of 18 Wallbrook Place, Coodinup. When a staff member from my office went to that address he discovered a resident who said that neither he nor his wife, the only people at that address, had any knowledge of that document. Yet a person named Nagi of that address was <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="652"> supposed to have authorised it. It was printed by Vanguard Press of 26 John Street, in Northbridge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What happened after that was that we made some more inquiries and we discovered that the printer had an order&mdash;this is the Vanguard Press&mdash;from a company known as Lightning Distributors. They ordered this particular document to be printed at Vanguard Printers. One of the partners in Lightning Distributors&mdash;surprise, surprise&mdash;is a Simon Ehrenfeld of 70 Bradford Street, Menora.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Simon Ehrenfeld happened to be the campaign manager of my opponent. So by a little bit of quite simplistic detective work we discovered that this document, authorised by some unknown person&mdash;quite clearly it was not Mr Nagi&mdash;was produced by the campaign of my opponent. It was quite clearly a breach of the Electoral Act. I hope that eventually these people will be prosecuted so the clear message is sent to people that these types of dirty tricks will not be tolerated in Australian electoral campaigns.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 26 April, the day after Anzac Day, I attended a candle vigil outside State Parliament House in my own right but also representing the Prime Minister, the Hon. John Howard, organised by the Ukrainian Council of New South Wales. The purpose of this vigil was to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster in which some 200 people died almost immediately and some 2,300 have since died as a result of the radiation. Because no&hyphen;one really knows what the time frame is for the effects of radiation to appear, it could well be that we will be looking at one of the great catastrophes of mankind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I addressed that meeting that was organised by the Ukrainian Council. It was held on the steps of Parliament House, Sydney. We marched down from there to the Sydney Opera House. It was a very moving ceremony. The organisers got us to stand first of all in a straight line facing the Opera House and there was another row running in an east&hyphen;west direction. In fact, we built the cross on the foresteps of the Opera House in Sydney. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> It was very moving to hear of what has occurred and what is currently occurring. The Ukrainians are in a terrible situation now because they just do not have the money to do the work that needs to be done. They have been left in the terrible position of never being able to resolve their situation without outside help.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the meeting two motions were put. I might just mention that these were two requests made by the Ukrainian Council of New South Wales of the former government which were either rejected or not replied to&mdash;I am not quite sure. However, the bottom line is that they were not able to get these requests granted from the former government. The motions were moved and passed unanimously by those present at the candle vigil. I gave them the assurance that I would read the two motions in this House and, in so doing, request the Treasurer (Mr Costello) to give consideration to their requests. The first motion reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the continued suffering of thousands of Ukrainians from the consequences of the Chernobyl nuclear accident, the attendees of the Sydney candle vigil hereby resolve that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Federal Government grant tax exempt status to donations to the Australian Chernobyl Children's Foundation so that funds can flow freely to the people in need, particularly thousands of children afflicted with aggressive thyroid cancer.</PARA>
<PARA>The second reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given that the Government of independent Ukraine bears the financial legacy of the communist USSR and does not have enough funds to assist victims as well as shut down the remaining Chernobyl reactors, the attendees of the Sydney candle vigil hereby resolve that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Federal Government make strong and direct representations to all Governments of the G7 countries to provide humanitarian relief for Chernobyl victims and financial assistance for the plant's final shutdown.</PARA>
<PARA>I feel very strongly about this because I have read a great deal about the Chernobyl incident. I think that, as a nation that prides itself on going to the assistance of those who are in desperate and dire need, agreeing to the requests of the Australian Ukrainian Council of New South Wales so it can assist its former homeland and people who are suffer <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="653"> ing, the likes of which, fortunately, we will never experience, is the least we can do.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to advise this parliament that in competing in many activities the results were: Bennelong won the volleyball, Chang won the theatre sports, Francis won the cross country and, as expected, Gould won the swimming and was the overall winner for 1995. I congratulate all participants.</PARA>

<TIME.STAMP>(10.00 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I take this opportunity to congratulate you on your elevation. It is fair to say that you are widely respected in the House for your tolerance. On behalf of the opposition, I wish you the best. It is obviously a very difficult job and it is often most unrewarding on your own side of parliament when under some pressure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Ministers of State Amendment Bill is largely uncontroversial, stemming from section 66 of the constitution, which has a requirement that there be amendments in regard to increases in ministerial salary. This, of course, interrelates with the 1990 Remuneration and Allowances Act and with increases that stem from the relationship between the wages of parliamentarians and those of the Senior Executive Service bands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One point that has emerged in the last week&mdash;and the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull) has given assurances that a seeming problem is being covered&mdash;relates to the impact of this move upon former ministers and the pensions of such people or their widows. Obviously, if you decrease the wages of the outer ministry, the interrelationship with former ministers' pensions or superannuation could be affected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The context in which this bill is being presented is one of the new frugality and lean administration of the government. Great play is being made of the reduction in the size of the ministry and the decision to pay a number of the more junior ministers less money. There is reference to the disappearance of the National Media Liaison Service and the supposed disappearance of consultants. Of course, this is a new nirvana, a new Camelot in Australian politics after 13 years in the desert, and all is going to change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On historical precedent, one has to have some doubts about this long&hyphen;term turn of events, if we have reference to the Fraser government and its early statements about what it was going to do and to a bit of the history afterwards, which involved the suppression of material in relation to areas such as wages and staffing levels. More interestingly, I heard a lot of this when, after 15 years in the wilderness, we had a new government in New South Wales and there were going to be similar changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has a job ahead of him in curbing the kind of problem that we saw emanate from that government when similar promises were made. Interestingly, the speech of the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) made reference to his maiden speech, but he certainly skipped over the regime that operated in that state. During that period we saw very few ministers survive the actual government&mdash;whether it was the Deputy Premier who was found by ICAC to have created a `climate conducive to corruption' or the Minister for Education who resigned after tax evasion or the assistant secretary who was in a similar category or the Minister for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="663"> Administrative Services who resigned after revelations of an attempt to influence the Minister for Planning. That was the kind of new broom that went through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have really got to have some doubts about the long&hyphen;term cost cutting and reduction in services of the ministerial wing. I can assure you that the opposition will be vigilant in these matters. It is interesting that already we are seeing the decision by five ministers to operate in their home states, supposedly for a variety of reasons. The Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) was not too interested in the comments of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), who said that, along with the privilege of serving as a minister or parliamentary secretary, there were some personal sacrifices in terms of the time and energy that must be devoted to official duties and some loss of privacy. The only reason Dr Wooldridge can give for moving his ministerial office to Melbourne was so that he would be, as he said on 8 April on Channel 10, `close to his family'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) came up with an even more preposterous proposition for why he had to be in Brisbane. On the same TV program, he said that it was to be `closer to our indigenous communities'. That is why the minister had to move his office to Brisbane. As we have seen in the last week or so, it might have more to do with his Albert Schweitzer efforts in the health field rather than with proximity to indigenous communities throughout this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are already seeing the decision to move ministerial offices to home states. That is obviously going to occasion refitting. It is also going to occasion public servants getting on planes every five minutes with pieces of paper and briefings, and obviously there will be a consequential increase in cost there. So that is one area where we are seeing difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also seen in the last few days the pressure that has been put on the minister for Aboriginal affairs to give up his occupation and there is the continuing question over the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson). Supposedly, there is no conflict of interest with regard to his operation of that portfolio and its interrelationship with the field in which he makes a dollar. Already&mdash;despite constant assurances from those opposite that they will reduce waste, that there will not be conflict of interest, that there will be integrity in government&mdash;there are very big questions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They made great play of who was overseas and who got whatever travel allowances et cetera, but when they tried to run a mock anti&hyphen;terrorist operation through the Protective Service coordinating centre, which runs mock anti&hyphen;terrorist activities for the ministers, they found that none of the ministers in this new government were available to undertake the operation&mdash;they were overseas or unavailable. That is typical of what we can expect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that this bill, as is indicated, essentially decreases the amount available for the coming year because of the reduction in the size of the ministry. That reduction in salaries pays for the increase for ministers under the previous government. There is nothing controversial in the measure but essentially we will be putting forward that there is a need to be vigilant, that there is a need to be watchful, especially given the already questionable insistence and attempt by some ministers to evade the Prime Minister's requirements with regard to ministerial conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is already evidence of some ministers having a commercial interest in fields where they have ministerial responsibility. As I said, there is a need to ensure that the promises we have been given with regard to reductions in consultancies do persist and are not simply an early enthusiasm for change which, as with the Fraser government, soon disappears.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CK6">Mr HARDGRAVE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. We are talking about amendments to the Ministers of State Act 1952 which, of course, sets the sum required from time to time to cover the changes to the level of ministerial salaries or the number of ministers. This sum is appropriated and is expected to meet the costs of salaries and no more. As has been mentioned already, it is based on section 66 of the constitution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes that are before us today are twofold: one is to tidy up the mess which was left behind by the previous government and the other sets a new course for this new government. The previous Labor administration, as we all know, was just no good with money. They increased ministerial salaries and they did not appropriate the funds that were necessary to cover the cost. These amendments today are all about that. Currently, the act limits the amount to $1.615 million but Labor spent more than that in the current year because it did not budget the funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation increases the appropriation to tidy this matter up for the current year. The amount involved is $1.64 million, which will meet the cost of paying previous ministers in the old Labor government. They are lucky that it was not a performance based pay agreement or a few of those former ministers might be owing the Australian people a large refund at the moment. Under the previous arrangements set by the old government, $1.78 million would have been the amount required in subsequent years under this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second set of amendments proposes a new lower limit of ministerial salaries for those who serve outside the cabinet. As a result of this second tier of wages for ministers, the amount required in subsequent years will decrease to $1.6 million. This saving might seem small in the overall scheme of things but it is a start. I applaud the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) for proposing these changes, although I believe that the changes do not reflect the expertise, experience and commitment which the ministers are bringing to their jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some members opposite may see the whole thing as a stunt and, if it is, it is quite unlike those of the previous government because it is one which actually saves money. I have spoken to a lot of members of my community about this, and they applaud the gesture. In fact, on the night that the minister made the announcement I was at one of my local clubs, the Macgregor Lions Club. Mr Deputy Speaker, you might be amused to know that I was fined by the tail twister as a result of this particular decision. He said there must be a lot of ministers in Canberra if a $10,000 reduction in pay was going to fix up an $8 billion hole in the budget. I paid over my couple of dollars quite happily.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was certainly the way they joked about it, but I must say that that gentleman, many others in the Macgregor Lions Club and other members of my community have since come to me and conceded that they see the gesture that is contained within this bill, as announced by the Prime Minister and the minister, as indicative of the sort of leadership that they wanted and expected from this government. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson) and the member for Moreton (Mr Hardgrave) for their contributions. I know the member for Reid did raise the issue of the superannuation payments to former members and their widows. For the record, I assure the member for Reid that the government was well aware of what the effects of that would be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act, parliamentary pensions are fixed as a percentage of parliamentary salaries payable to serving members from time to time. The $10,000 reduction in the additional salary for non&hyphen;cabinet ministers did have the effect of reducing pensions for politicians. In order that the effect of this measure be prospective and not retrospective, the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) wrote to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on 2 May seeking his agreement to amend the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act of 1948. The Prime Minister has replied to my colleague the Minister for Finance consenting to such an amendment. So that will be covered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Reid&mdash;in a good&hyphen;natured way, I am sure&mdash;raised the issue of my capacity to keep the costs of government under control. Let me assure the member for Reid that I am well equipped to do this and that the business of keeping costs under control is already well under way. He did mention a couple of items but, if you look at the savings that have been made in the first couple of weeks of this government, it really is quite incredible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly, the reduction in ministerial salaries was a marked move away from the moves that were made by our predecessors. The reduction in the size of the ministry also brings considerable savings to the government. The reduction in the number of consultants to the ministry, from 40 to one&mdash;and that one consultant being to the Prime Minister&mdash;also saves millions of dollars. So that commitment is there and at the moment we do have under review a number of other areas where we think we could make some considerable savings in the cost of government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If we are going to fix up this black hole, obviously there has to be an example set by the leadership of the country. I believe that example has already been set and will continue to be set as we review the costs of government. By the interest that has been shown in this bill, with so many government members in the chamber, I know that they too are going to make sure that the government does meet its commitment of reducing unnecessary costs. When you have members such as the member for Gilmore (Mrs Gash) and the member for Petrie (Ms Gambaro) who have certainly been most up&hyphen;front in terms of their commitment to slashing government expenditure, you can see the sort of backup that this government is going to have as it tries to rationalise the cost of government in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also thank the member for Moreton (Mr Hardgrave) for his contribution. I am fully aware of that particular Lions club as it used to be in my constituency. I will not tell you some of the things that I was fined for over the years, but I know from the membership of that club that they too would be very interested in the cost reduction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill does provide some very real savings in the money that is going to be required not only for this year, under the new government, but also over coming years when we will see significant savings. I understand the bid for next financial year will be $1.6 million, which is a reduction of what we are looking for at the moment; that is, $1.64 million to cover the costs of the salaries of ministers of the previous government. I thank those who have contributed to the bill. We look forward to its speedy passage in the other place.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is my first speech in this chamber. This bill is a pretty straightforward proposition. The main purpose is to insert in the Excise Tariff Act 1921 the definition of `prescribed division' which is currently contained in an excise by&hyphen;law. In effect, what that definition does is determine the periods of the year for calculating excise duty on crude oil under the Excise Tariff Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill has been presented as the result of advice received by the government from the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department earlier this year. That advice suggested that the transfer of the definition from the by&hyphen;law to the act should be made for the purposes of clarity, and with retrospective effect to the date that the by&hyphen;law definition came in&mdash;which was 1 July 1983.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the amendment which this bill effects is remedial. It will put the validity of both future and past duty collections beyond challenge. We appreciate the importance of the technical amendment to secure the revenue base and it is against that background that we will be supporting the passage of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also makes a drafting amendment to the Excise Tariff Act to achieve gender neutrality.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Country people fully accept that there may be a few cents per litre difference in the price of fuel but they will not accept the fact that between urban and rural prices there could be differentials of 10c, 15c and sometimes up to 20c per litre in the price of petrol or diesel fuel. This is a very important issue for me, as it is, I am sure, for the member for Ballarat and a number of other members representing rural constituencies. It is a very important issue and it is one which the coalition addressed during the lead&hyphen;up to the 1996 election campaign.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="667">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister at that time, Peter McGauran, the federal member for Gippsland, was very active on this issue during the election campaign. He introduced a proposal to introduce fairness and transparency into country petrol prices. When the shadow minister launched that in Melbourne he said that the policy that we would be implementing in government would ensure that consumers in country areas would be able to buy petrol at fair prices. He claimed that there were distortions in the market which caused unacceptable pricing differentials between metropolitan and country markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since that time, of course, the coalition has been elected to government and we are looking forward now to the government and the minister implementing this policy. As a first stage in this, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has been asked to examine prices at every stage from the refinery gate to the petrol pump to investigate any anti&hyphen;competitive or discriminatory pricing schemes so that offenders can be prosecuted. These hearings will be held throughout the length and breadth of Australia and I understand that that process has already commenced. The minister has obviously been very active. He has implemented this policy and is going to make every possible endeavour to ensure that country people have access to fuel at a reasonable price.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that people can understand that there would be one or two cents difference in the price per litre resulting from fuel being transported from the refinery gate to country areas. They can accept that, but they certainly cannot accept the wide variation in prices that has occurred over many years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Keating government failed miserably in its attempts to implement any mechanism whatsoever to address this problem. It preferred to ignore the problem. It just looked at it over 13 years. In an effort to try and get a petrol pricing policy that would achieve some form of equity and balance throughout Australia, it never came up with anything that was satisfactory to country motorists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can recall that when the Hon. George Gear&mdash;I think he was the Assistant Treasurer at the time and is a former member now&mdash;was asked about the difference betweeen country fuel prices and their metropolitan counterparts, he said that he dismissed completely the concerns of country people and business people in country areas. He claimed, `The issue is one that just needs to die down.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will not die. When you are paying up to 20c a litre more for fuel than someone 150 kilometres away in Melbourne, I can assure you that the issue does not die down in an area like Bendigo. Nor would it die down as an issue in an area like Ballarat. It is on everyone's mind; it is a major factor in everyone's budget, and car expenses are a very significant factor in the cost of living in a country area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For many people in country areas, and certainly in my area, petrol and diesel are not only essential commodities for the rural and farming community but are also very important parts of the costing of any industry or business which operates outside the metropolitan area. The additional costs which are incurred by those businesses in rural and regional areas have to be passed on to the consumer as part of their business activities. That makes other services and other commodities in regional areas more expensive than they are in metropolitan areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a very important issue. It is one which I am delighted to see the minister has tackled early in the parliamentary year at the start of the new government, after 13 years of neglect by the former government, which was not prepared to address this question. The minister has set out to try and get some transparency and some fairness into the country pricing structure. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="668"> I look forward to seeing the activities of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission as it carries out its duties throughout country Australia, having hearings and inquiring into the petroleum industry to make sure that everyone is treated fairly throughout the length and breadth of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This issue will not die down as the former Assistant Treasurer, Mr George Gear, claimed it would. It will not die down. I am pleased to see the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) come into these proceedings, because he would be aware of the huge cost of petrol in his electorate and the difference that it would make to him if there were some equity and fairness in the pricing of petrol throughout rural areas of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With those few remarks, I support the progress of this bill, which is non&hyphen;controversial. I make the point that we will be watching the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission work and report back to the government. It will ensure that prices are monitored and costs and profits in the petroleum industry&mdash;including oil company distributors and service station operators&mdash;are looked at to ensure compliance with the consumer protection and competitive conduct provisions of the Trade Practices Act. Where the ACCC identifies price discrimination or unfair prices, the government will act to maintain fair business practice within the industry.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill 1996 might have been of some consequence but it quite clearly is merely a housekeeping bill. All it really does is take the legislation out of the by&hyphen;laws and put it into the act on advice from the Attorney&hyphen;General, which probably means it was not necessary anyway. But, having listened to the previous speaker, I thought I must have been here to discuss the wrong bill. I am glad that he ranged so widely, because I am going to too. In respect of country fuel prices, if he is paying 20c a litre more for fuel&mdash;living in the outer suburbs of Melbourne as he does&mdash;there is something wrong. I would say that that `something' must clearly rest with the federal member, because if I lived that close to Perth and my fuel was 20c dearer than it was in Perth I would be screaming blue murder. It is simply not right; transport costs do not come anywhere near that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I want to talk about is deeper. As it says in Isaiah, `Where there is no vision, the people perish.' I think we have a situation in Australia wherein we have a lack of vision. I want to put a scenario to you; it relates very vaguely to fuel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Around Rundle in Queensland, there is a vast resource of fuel oil available in the rock. With the advent of a technological advance pioneered in Canada by Australians with Australian money, we have worked out a much more effective way of getting fuel out of these rocks. If the government were to forgo excise on this altogether, this would be highly viable. It would free up our existing supply of oil and it could be exported overseas. While we cannot set the oil price, because of the quality of our oil, we will always sell it. This could really do something to address our balance of trade, which seriously needs to be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is no good just doing this in isolation. If we were to redress the balance of trade and reduce our debt, the immediate consequence&mdash;with other things being put in place&mdash;would be to raise the value of the Australian dollar. As every member of the National Party should know, that would be disastrous for most farm exports. If we converted our fuel source to shale oils, we would convert enormous capital cost into labour cost. We would have a very large increase in job availability. I have not done the figures: when I have, you will hear all about <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="669"> it. I strongly suspect that pay-as-you-earn taxation would more than offset the revenue that government would lose through such a process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my calculations, this Excise Tariff Amendment Bill will give us somewhere under $200 million a year on oil. There is a chance that we could have an increase in government revenue, an enormous increase in employment and a substantial increase in export earnings. It will require vision and this government does not seem to have this vision and neither did the previous government. Mr Deputy Speaker, I have ranged widely; I thank you for your tolerance. I urge the previous member to look into the freight component of oil in his electorate and, if necessary, to leave parliament and to get into fuel transport.</PARA></SPEECH>

I looked at item 1 subsection 6A(2) of the schedule to the bill and saw that the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel used the break after the parliament was prorogued to identify remaining acts and draft appropriate amendments to achieve a gender neutral result. This involved a lot of Commonwealth drafting. I thought I had a pretty miserable time over the election campaign, but I suspect I got off fairly lightly compared to the onerous task that the Office of Parliamentary Counsel had in going through the remaining Commonwealth acts that needed to have gender neutral language included.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to speak this morning about this Excise Tariff Amendment Bill and ensure that we, as a nation, maintain $1.9 billion worth of revenue received since 1984&hyphen;85 from new crude oil. Heaven knows this country can ill afford a $1.9 billion loss after the endeavours of my colleagues opposite. The member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) can wave his independent flag and absolve himself of all sins, but a lot of us on this side of the House know very well that he was directly involved in the decisions of the former government which impacted dramatically upon rural and country people. The honourable member sat on his seat for six years. There is no point in attacking this government. Not once in his time under that former government did he have the intestinal fortitude to take them on. He should not come in here waving his independent flag and telling the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) about petrol prices, because for six years he did nothing at all to address the problems facing rural and regional people.</PARA>
<PARA>As far as crude oil is concerned and the price of petrol, not once did I hear him talking about it. Not once did he raise it, but there he was, perched on the edge of his chair, attacking his government, until push came to shove, and then he went missing every single time. I am pleased to see that the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) is here too, because he had a time as the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, as some of you may well remember. They bought him a pair of moleskins and some elastic sided boots, and got him a Driza&hyphen;Bone, with the tag still hanging off the back of it after six months, and not once did he talk about petrol prices. Not one single thing did he do to stop the inequity between petrol pricing in metropolitan Australia and non&hyphen;metropolitan Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) knows very well that the cost of petrol in the country as opposed to the metropolitan areas is an absolute disgrace. Might I say that the question&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While we are talking about it, I will give you a scenario about what it is like living outside metropolitan Australia. This was the biggest problem with the former government, and that is why they were absolutely decimated in non&hyphen;metropolitan Australia, and some of my colleagues are here today as a result of that. Not once was the former government ever prepared to concede that life outside metropolitan Australia was totally different from that in the city. What they failed to realise was that public transport is not available. The members from the country here today know&mdash;the member for Burke knows&mdash;that country people do not do anything without using their cars. I am talking about families that are driving 30, 50, or 100 kilometres purely to do the shopping and they are driving their kids to sporting venues. Their lives revolve around the motor vehicle, not through any great desire to jump in a car and drive it, but through absolute necessity. Every time they jump in their car, their expenditure goes through the roof. But not once did the former government do anything about that petrol price inequity. Not once! The platitudes before the election from you people sickened me. At the public meetings around Australia the candidates got up and they had no idea what they were talking about. They had no intention, when push came to shove, of doing anything about it. We are going to do something about it and we will make up for the 13 years lost time that you gave us.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak in support of the Dairy Produce Levy (No. 1) Amendment Bill and the Dairy Produce Amendment Bill. The contribution made by the Australian dairy industry to the real wealth of Australia is, without question, substantial. In 1994&hyphen;95 the export value of Australian major dairy products was $1,351 million&mdash;that is, nearly $1&half; billion&mdash;and we expect that value to rise by 15 per cent in the 1995&hyphen;96 season. Despite some of the great difficulties placed upon agriculture and agribusiness in Australia under the previous government, the dairy industry is an example of where we have moved beyond a dependence on commodity sales and now have a growing percentage of the share of the added value market.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have spent the last four years as a doctoral fellow analysing the export performance of the dairy industry, as well as of other food export industries in Australia. In particular, I have been assessing the impact of the industry's organisation, regulatory environment and marketing strategies and have compared Australia's industry development with that of its competitors. I can speak with some degree of confidence when I say that the dairy produce levy schemes&mdash;the market support levies&mdash;as well as the corporation, promotion and research levies, have been instrumental in assisting the dairy industry to enter and grow in the deregulated international markets, particularly those of Asia and now Europe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In line with our commitments under the Uruguay Round of GATT it is now necessary that we rejig the industry marketing schemes to remove any direct nexus between exporting and domestic market support. We have before us an amendment which really, in terms of its practice, came into effect in the industry in July 1995. The amendments are now in line with GATT; however, the revenue generated by the scheme, and so the benefits to producers under the industry, are intact. It is these new arrangements which are now being ratified and formalised in the amendment today, and that is why you will see that the opposition is as concerned as we are that this amendment flows through without difficulty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In July 1995 the domestic market support scheme replaced the 1986 arrangements that had been in effect for raising the domestic farm gate prices for manufacturing milk by approximately 2c per litre above international market returns. All Australian milk producers are levied to produce these enhancements, and this is known as the market support program. The scheme has had the effect of reducing the difference between farm gate prices paid for market or drinking milk and for manufactured milk. We all know that in Australia farm gate prices are generally so low that many of our best producers across the agribusiness field barely survive from one season to the next.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thus, given this little assistance, dairy farmers supplying milk destined for processing and export were able to make the investments necessary to increase production to meet growing export markets. As well, by paying producers according to their milk's fat and protein content, a quality&hyphen;consciousness was brought to bear on the industry&mdash;which had, as had so many other <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="674"> agriproduct areas, been more focused on quantity of output rather than quality&mdash;over the decades in which it has survived.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The market signals through this levying process have been transmitted to the dairy producer quickly and often, and so today we have a very sophisticated, innovative and businesslike dairy producing sector in Australia. The market support schemes have been particularly important for Victoria and for my area, the Murray electorate, because we are the home of the dairy export industry, where only some nine per cent of milk is destined for the higher value, fresh drinking market, compared with New South Wales, where 60 per cent of dairy production goes to the fresh drinking milk market in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should be noted that, although we have had this levy and this support, we are not talking about ongoing support forever. The amendment shows it will be phased out by the year 2000. But we need those last few years of support because of the rapidly changing regulatory environment in the international dairy trade and also the substantially changing and evolving markets for dairy produce that are particular to the north of us in Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me talk a little about those changes and how well geared up we are to capture the opportunities that are being presented to us. Given that we, in terms of international production, are fairly small&hyphen;scale dairy producers, it has been the European subsidised EC producers who have been the price setters. The prices that they have created have been artificially low.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia, as a small producer, has been a price taker. To compete in the commodity markets, in particular with these artificially low prices, Australia and New Zealand have had to become the world's lowest cost dairy producers. In Australia, however, we have also become the lowest cost administrator of our dairy industry in the sense that the ADC operates with only two per cent overheads compared with seven per cent for the New Zealand Dairy Board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the GATT takes affect internationally, we can expect dairy production in Europe to fall and prices to adjust to reflect real demand and real growth in the markets of the world. We also expect the USA industry to come on line with reference to their GATT commitments. At the moment they continue to subsidise and their production is continuing to expand. We look forward to the time when the USA also takes GATT seriously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian dairy industry is not protected on international or domestic markets. The market for domestic dairy produce in Australia is mature&mdash;it is not expanding. Manufacturers in Australia have long had to compete with produce from New Zealand that is freely imported into our supermarkets. Given New Zealand has a very small domestic market&mdash;it has to export over 90 per cent of its total annual milk production&mdash;we in Australia have to be not only very good, but also world best to survive in our domestic markets as well as internationally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite all the constraints and artificially low prices I have talked about, quality and price conscious markets like Japan were in fact captured by us. We have the leading market share for cheese in Japan. In 1995, our share was 32.5 per cent compared to New Zealand's 28.7 per cent and Europe's 30.3 per cent. In 1996, we expect to draw even further ahead of the low cost New Zealand producers. We are doing extraordinarily well in an extraordinarily difficult international environment and in a nation which, until March 2, gave no particular help to agriproduct in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are expecting to see our dairy produce increase in availability in Australia&mdash;from about 8.6 billion litres now to some 10 billion litres by the year 2000. We are gearing up.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="675">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How is the market evolving? I have talked about the regulatory environment changing. In fact, the market demand in our near neighbours is evolving. We have to gear up to meet that demand if we are to compete and succeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dairy produce is not a traditional food in Japan&mdash;the most valuable market to us&mdash;or in other Asian markets. There is lactose intolerance in a lot of those countries. During the 1950s, because of the Second World War and the destruction of most of the local food supplies in places like Japan, Korea, the Philippines, Taiwan and so on, food aid in the form of milk powder was one of the life saving foods introduced to those countries. Despite their lactose intolerance, those countries became accustomed to drinking milk&mdash;reconstituted milk powder. Much of it came from the USA; some came from Australia. Those countries began to understand the value of milk for the long&hyphen;term nutritional benefit of their population, which had been protein limited in their traditional diets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In each of these countries&mdash;and, indeed, throughout all of Asia&mdash;as per capita income is rising, the family structure is changing, from an extended family with a mother at home cooking for the whole family to a nuclear and even a single parent situation. The food consumption patterns are the quick&hyphen;fix, single&hyphen;portion meal, microwaved rather than stir&hyphen;fried. Children come in from school, eat a light meal alone and rush out to tutoring. In Japan, at any one time, one in four of the male household heads are away from the home base, living alone in regional centres and looking for easy, quick&hyphen;to&hyphen;prepare, high energy foods. So the slice of pizza or bread and melted cheese is perfect for them, and so our shredded, stretched cheese exports have risen from 3,000 tonnes in 1990 to over 16,000 tonnes in 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an escalation of the westernisation of traditional Asian diets and food consumption patterns based on cows' milk. Now they are using dairy products for children, as confectionery, medicinals&mdash;as in Yakult&mdash;as fast food and quick&hyphen;fix snack foods at home. The addition of a slice of cheese to the McDonald's hamburger has been underwriting much of the new dairy production and consumption in all of these countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As per capita income rises, food tastes evolve, refrigeration becomes more common, food technology becomes more sophisticated, mom and pop stores and the wet markets are replaced by supermarkets, and the demand is for a more processed retail ready product. The domestic dairy manufacturing industry, challenged by rising wages, starts to import more of its ingredients and then looks to go offshore to places like Australia for joint ventures where the product will be re&hyphen;exported to the home country base. That is occurring in China, India, Japan, Korea and, in particular, in countries such as Indonesia where we are entering into joint ventures. We know that in time such ventures may come back onshore to us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The revolution in market demand for dairy products is matched by the evolving market structure. We have to look at more of the retailers as buyers. In Japan, for example, the supermarkets are wanting to bypass the big trading houses or Sogo Shosha, such as Mitsubishi and Mitsui, to deal direct with our own manufacturers&mdash;Bonlac and Murray&hyphen;Goulburn, for example. In dealing direct, those retailers demand that our manufacturers provide different packs and packaging, a faster response to food fads and a quick response to their `just new' products as a buying incentive in their home markets. Our dairying manufacturers have to become world best and highly sophisticated, with technology that is able to deliver the clean, green, no chemical additive type of product demanded in these sophisticated markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So how are we positioned to maximise these new opportunities and the different demands that are now upon us? We have come a very long way. I have described our increases in value <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="676"> and volume&mdash;the fact that we have gone from commodity style to more value added product. However, the dairy industry still has a long way to go. That is why these amendments are important and the period to the year 2000 before the levies are gone is significant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our dairy industry is still affected by seasonality. We still cannot produce year&hyphen;round high&hyphen;quality dairy product. Yet markets such as Japan demand fresh cheese; they do not like a product which has been produced three or four months before. So we are going to have to move more to grain and other supplementation for our dairy herds, which is going to add costs to our dairy industry. Right now, the grains are extraordinarily expensive but, without this year&hyphen;round production of dairy product, our seasonality will continue to drag us down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our manufacturing is still not world best practice in all instances although Peters Western Australia is regarded as world best in its total cleanliness, in terms of its E.coli measures and so on. But, as a legacy of years of neglect by the previous government, the infrastructure supporting our dairy industry is inadequate. Too often, the milk tankers which have to ply the roads twice a day are on main roads which are crumbling, and are not substantially or sufficiently maintained so that those tankers can get through when they should.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have power surges in our power systems in my Murray electorate. This can mean that the highly sophisticated computerised evaporative systems that the dried milk powder producers use are shocked perhaps two or three times a day with power surges. We do not have natural gas in some of the areas where our big dairy manufacturers wish to expand with cheap power alternatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our telecommunications systems are not sufficient in areas in my electorate in particular, where mobile phones are essential&mdash;not a luxury&mdash;for primary producers a long time away from their home base, for milk tanker drivers, and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have a crisis in Australia in terms of education and training for food technologists, for those who should be carrying our industry into the future. Until we address our shortage of food technologists and those who will support world best dairy manufacturing we will be dependent on people imported from Europe telling us how to do things right and that will always leave us behind the eight ball.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have come a long way. We have examples where some of the biggest dairy manufacturers like Snow Brand, which are nearly 10 times the size of our own Bonlac Foods and the Murray&hyphen;Goulburn cooperatives, are in joint venture arrangements with a little dairy company like Tatura Milk Products in my electorate. They now produce infant formula for re&hyphen;export.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we speak, another greenfields joint venture arrangement is going ahead between Meiji, Mitsubishi and Murray&hyphen;Goulburn. Again, we are talking about some of the world's largest and most sophisticated dairy manufacturers joint venturing with us in Australia. This is the way that things are going in the future. But there are constraints, as I have described, in the infrastructure. Already the Murray&hyphen;Goulburn region is running short of fresh water and waste water disposal systems are inadequate. As I said, the industry's labour needs are not being met under current training and education arrangements in Australia, and we have infrastructure problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our primary producers have to come up to worldwide best practice in terms of production. The amendments proposed preserve the benefit of a scheme that is essential as the international environment deregulates and the market conditions change. And so I have a strong sense of urgency in supporting the amendments to this bill.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We look forward to your role in the chair. Let me also say how pleased I am to follow the member for Murray (Mrs Stone). She will make a great contribution to the parliament and she does represent a premier dairying area of Australia&mdash;second only, of course, to western Victoria. We should get that clearly on the record. In her electorate, she has got some problems of salting  of which she has a very great understanding. I was pleased with her contribution to this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to acknowledge also the member for Braddon (Mr Miles) who has a number of dairy farmers in his area. There are a couple of very big herds of 1,700 cows on King Island. So the member for Braddon has a good understanding of the dairy industry, and northern Tasmania makes a good contribution to the export of dairy products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst the amendments to the dairy produce bills seem fairly insignificant, they are significant bills in the philosophic context. To get the right framework, let me read from the explanatory memorandum in relation to the changes. The memorandum says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The changes to the market support arrangements constitute a minor legal correction and do not affect the administration of the scheme. Importantly, the market support arrangements remain consistent with Australia's commitments to the World Trade Organization Agreement.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that sets out that we are moving towards a more export orientated industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the debate on the previous bill, the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill, there was a lot of emotion in this chamber in relation to petrol pricing and other matters. I do not think there will be the same degree of argument about the dairy industry. But some 10 years ago emotions ran high in the dairy industry over the Kerin plan, and people were very concerned about how their industry was being affected. But I just say that with the Kerin plan and the adjustments of the Crean plan, and with the activities of dairy industry leaders who I think have shown a change in attitude over the last 10 years, we now have a position where the dairy industry is profitable, especially in Victoria. The dairy industries in New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia have contracted somewhat to the fresh milk market. In Tasmania they do retain an export orientation because of the high rainfall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With all the very vigorous debates and the number of deputations that we had back in 1985&hyphen;86&hyphen;87, we now see an industry that is allowing market forces and the export focus to lead to the creation of real wealth in the dairy industry. We see that in western Victoria and in the seat of Murray the dairy farmers are now, along with the wheat farmers, the affluent people in agricultural industries in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that these market forces have been oriented towards exports. They have been organised by private companies and cooperatives and not by statutory marketing arrangements, which used to be the order of the day in the dairy industry. Some of us have argued fairly vigorously about that. Again, there has been a tremendous amount of emotional energy directed towards marketing arrangements in the dairy industry and government subsidies over the last 40 or 50 years. The removal of regulation has also been a key feature of the changes in the dairy industry so that the export markets in a true market sense can create opportunities without the regulation of the domestic market in the hope that the export market would follow.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="678">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In all agricultural commodities Australia stands to gain from a freer and more open world market and the GATT arrangements will assist Australia, both in the dairy industry and in the other agricultural products. Rather than the protectionism and higher tariff levels that were advocated in some quarters, the whole dairy industry now has moved towards this export culture, and that has ensured that in the current pricing arrangements the industry is profitable and has improved its productivity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I draw the attention of the chamber to some of the interesting figures on these dramatic changes that have taken place over the last 20 years. The number of farms has nearly halved. In 1971 we had 48,000 farmers approximately and in 1990, the last set of figures I have got, we have 14,000 farmers. That shows a dramatic reduction in the number of farmers actually involved in the dairy industry. The figures suggest that there are about 8,000 dairy farmers in Victoria, so it is the predominant state for dairying, with the seats of Murray, Corangamite and Wannon in Gippsland being the most productive areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at the actual size of the herd, in 1970 there were about 2.8 million cows. The herd is now down to 1.6 million cows. It is a dramatic reduction in the number of cows and yet production has increased. If you look at the amount of milk produced per cow, in 1979 it was 2,600 litres per cow and in 1990 3,800 litres per cow. It shows the tremendous improvements in productivity and genetics, and the increase in the productive capacity of dairy farms generally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">New Zealand and Australia are probably the low cost producers in the world and New Zealand remains one of our strongest competitors on world markets. As I say, more and more emphasis has been directed towards the export market. We have been moving away from the fresh milk market sector so that we can export to the South&hyphen;East Asian market, which is becoming more lucrative, and not worry too much about the domestic milk market, which so much of this political debate in other times has revolved around for state governments and, to a lesser degree, for federal governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The dairy industry really is a great example of value adding at the factory level and as we sell the products overseas. As an agricultural producer, the industry value adds in the processing area and then is able to sell its product. The value of our dairy exports in 1995&hyphen;96 is nearly $2 billion and it is predicted that by the year 2001, which is not far away, the value of those exports will be $2.5 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1980, 21 per cent of Australia's dairy production was exported and by 1985 the figure had risen to 32 per cent. Today, 45 per cent of our production is exported and it is expected to be 55 per cent by the year 2000. In very simple terms, half the production of the Australian dairy industry will be in the export markets. This represents a tremendous difference, in philosophic terms, from what was historically the case when most of the emphasis was on the domestic, more profitable, fresh milk market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have mentioned, this transition took place as a result of the Kerin plan in 1986. Those of us who come from electorates that have an association with the dairy industry remember the very vigorous arguments that took place with the then minister who, in my view, put up a very forward&hyphen;thinking plan. A number of the dairy industry representatives at that time were still looking at holding the line at the state level&mdash;having constrained interstate trade. I think the minister managed to break that mould and did a very good job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That plan imposed a levy on all milk produced and then distributed the proceeds to the exporters so as to assist them in the competitive world environment by transferring to them <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="679"> some of the better domestic consumer price at that time. That was at a time when the world market was being upset by subsidies by the European market and by the Americans and others. The Crean plan in 1992 was a plan to phase down the level of support given to the dairy industry by the year 2000&mdash;and the bill before the chamber is compatible with that&mdash;so that the industry will be internationally competitive by that time and will not be dependent upon the relationship between fresh milk and the export price.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year the market support system was further amended to conform with Australia's obligations under the Uruguay Round of the GATT. The previous scheme was seen to amount to an export subsidy but the system that was introduced by the parliament last year was GATT&hyphen;legal. There was a fair bit of debate about the definition of illegality and the terms that the GATT operated on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The present system imposes a levy on market milk and manufactured milk which is consumed in Australia. The only milk that does not attract a levy is the manufactured produce which is exported. The present system effectively operates like a consumption tax&mdash;domestic consumption is taxed while exports are tax free. The effect is the same: domestic consumers subsidise the export sector when prices in Australia are higher than world prices. That has always been the fundamental argument: that as prices come closer together the domestic fresh milk price will not be so significant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said at the beginning of my speech, this legislation is just to get some minor amendments to conform with the GATT arrangement. The bill helps to define clearly the distinction between market milk, serving the domestic fresh milk sector, and manufacturing milk. The present rate of market support is 33.271c per kilogram of milk fat and 79.8c per kilogram of protein. The levies on market milk and domestically consumed manufacturing milk raised about $160 million, collected and distributed by the Australian Dairy Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As was the intention of the Crean plan, the rate of support given to the export industry is being wound back towards the year 2000. That is the thrust of this bill. Thus the dairy industry has become an industry dominated by international forces of supply and demand with a strong export focus. In Victoria, 91 per cent of the milk goes into manufacturing, much of which is exported. ABARE expects the value of the Australian dairy industry to rise by 31 per cent between now and the year 2000. So, again, we see this quite big increase in the value of the exports. That has been reflected on the farms in the electorate of Murray, down in Gippsland, and in western Victoria as these export prices are holding and actually increasing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interestingly enough, Australia's market share is expected to rise from its present level of 14 per cent of world exports to 17 per cent over the next five years. More importantly, in east Asia, Australia's market share has climbed to 34 per cent, ahead of New Zealand&mdash;which is our key competitor&mdash;Norway, the United States of America and Denmark. The strong export performance has given rise to greater profitability amongst Australian dairy farmers, which members who represent these electorates can see from the construction of new rotary dairies worth up to half a million dollars, improved pastures and improved productivity by cow herds. It is suggested that the cash incomes in 1995&hyphen;96 are expected, from the ABARE figures, to rise from $52,000 to $66,000. We know from personal observation that a number of the dairy farmers are extremely profitable at the moment and there is a lot of investment moving into the dairy industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The success of the dairy industry has been fuelled by this export price and we have seen huge investments in the processing by the cooperatives. The $30 million invested in a drying <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="680"> plant in part of my former electorate at Cobden in western Victoria is a very good example of this. The companies of Bonlac, Kraft, the Bega Cooperative, United Milk in Tasmania, Murray&hyphen;Goulburn, Queensco Unity Dairy Foods and Malanda Dairy Foods have all put new capital investments into the processing operations utilising new technology. The Japanese Snow Brand Company has entered into a joint venture with Tatura Milk Industries, which again is an innovation from the former position where only dairy farmers were involved in processing. Nestles expressed an interest in using Australia as a base for its dairy operations in Asia. Japanese companies such as Meija Milk Products and Itochu Corporation have both flagged a desire to operate in Australia, exporting to South-East Asia. Again that is a dramatic difference in terms of philosophic approach and the attitude of the dairy industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Uruguay Round of GATT has brought about a number of trade liberalisation requirements in world agriculture. The main elements of the package require a clarification of non&hyphen;tariff barriers, 36 per cent reduction in tariff barriers, 36 per cent reduction in outlays on export subsidies and a 21 per cent reduction in volumes of subsidies for export. Those of us who have been in the argument about tariffs understand the non&hyphen;tariff barriers that have been used by some countries to maintain the high tariffs towards imports. To date the worst offenders in terms of trade barriers in the dairy industry have been Europe, Japan and the USA. In America, the dairy export incentive program has been specifically targeting Australia's traditional export markets in South&hyphen;East Asia. On February 2, the USA Department of Agriculture announced a three&hyphen;month allocation of this scheme for 10,000 tonnes of subsidised skim milk powder, 100 tonnes of cheese and 1,800 tonnes of butterfat into South&hyphen;East Asia, so the Americans are using some of these backdoor methods to upset some of our traditional markets and increase their market share whilst the changes to GATT are going on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to ABARE, the impact of these policies and prices on the Asian markets have been insignificant so far because of the general shortages of supply which have kept prices high. Nevertheless, the American government continues to make a concerted push into the Asian market before its GATT obligations become fully binding, in an attempt, as I say, to gain an additional market share.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Graham Tonkin, the Managing Director of the Australian Dairy Corporation, recently told the 1996 Outlook Conference:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the end of the first year of the implementation of the Uruguay Round we find that world prices and local prices can be quickly eroded by subsidised product from the USA and the European Union. The three largest and potentially most lucrative dairy markets, the European Union, the USA and Japan, are tightly controlled by quotas and government regulations. The main developing markets in South&hyphen;East Asia can be severely restricted by increasing tariffs. Efficient agricultural producers can be threatened in their home market by subsidised products without recourse to countervailing action. Domestic prices in the European Union, USA and Canada and elsewhere continue to support production of uneconomic surpluses.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that summarises our fears over the last 10 years about the remarkable amount of money that the European Common Market can devote to agriculture. Approximately $US60 billion of subsidy has been put towards keeping the eight million farmers on the land in Europe. That in turn has reflected on our own dairy farmers here in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The European herd has fallen by about 320,000 in the past year and, in eastern Europe, deregulation has seen the dismantling of producer and consumer subsidies. Herd size and production have begun to fall as the subsidies have been gradually removed. The US Congress has moved towards winding back farm programs and the 1995 Farm Bill has helped to bring about some of those changes.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="681">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The developing Asian economies, on which we are very dependent for our markets, are moving from the peasant based rural economies towards manufacturing based on imported raw materials such as Australian skim milk power. In Bangladesh, Red Cow milk powder is being imported and is a valuable additive to the national diet of that country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By the year 2000, there will still be some production controls and price supports in the USA and Europe. However, the ability of uneconomic production to continue with the help of limitless subsidy will be severely lessened with the implementation of GATT reforms. All dairy farmers are worried about this key argument&mdash;that the USA might introduce some form of subsidy to look after a small section of its political support base and upset the very profitable industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The central lesson from the experience of the dairy industry is that market forces and an export focus are the key to real wealth creation in the dairy areas of Victoria. The industry has moved from the regulated fresh milk market sector towards the competitive world market of export. World liberalisation stands to benefit the Australian dairy industry rather than a restricted market. I recall that, in the earlier debates with Minister Kerin, the dairy industry suggested a restriction of about 5.5 million litres. By the year 2000, we will have about 11 million litres. So we doubled the production and we are able to sell it because we have that export focus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must make sure that we have that focus and that we continue to export. If we move away from protection and regulation, the future of the dairy industry will be assured. We must continue to maintain the quality of the product and the process and ensure that all investments are of world quality standards. We must continue to maintain this focus and supply these lucrative markets in Asia. We must fight off the subsidisation that is always around the corner in America and Europe.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate you, Mr Deputy Speaker, on your high appointment. I hope that you will give me some indulgence today. As the previous speakers, the member for Murray (Mrs Stone) and the member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur), have covered the basic purpose of these bills, I do not intend to repeat those remarks in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> . They were made very clearly. However, I am concerned that the member for Murray claimed that her area was the home of dairying in Victoria. I am further concerned that the member for Corangamite said that his electorate in Victoria is the only area in Victoria to outstrip the member for Murray's electorate. I have to disappoint them both and tell them that the home of dairying has been, and forever will be, the beautiful lands of Gippsland. The rich grass grows there&mdash;but neither of these members would understand this. In this public place, I invite both honourable members to come to Gippsland to see those rolling hills and to smell that grass. We can stop at a place in Drouin where they will be able to watch the grass grow unaided by fertiliser or irrigation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been high quality representation for a long time.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it makes a difference to have that type of representation. The member for Corangamite has spoken today on this bill and said, `Look, we have a direction to go. There's a place where Australia has to head.' The member for Murray has a clear understanding of what the dairy industry is all about and where the export industry is headed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I sincerely apologise but I was making the point that the member for Corangamite has a clear grasp of the issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come from the township of Koo Wee Rup and I grew up on a dairy farm of 40 acres. The Bayles butter factory, the Drouin butter factory, and the Cora Lynn butter factory&mdash;in fact, four or five small milk factories, as we call them&mdash;were all there. On a Sunday evening we could smell the whey five miles away at the butter factory at Bayles. I grew up with that stench in my nose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My parents earned enough money from those 40 acres to raise a family, buy a Holden every couple of years, and live a pretty good life. That was back in the late 1940s and early 1950s. In 1996 it is impossible to run a farm of that size, of course. In fact, a farm 10 times that size is now about the norm in that area for dairying. And very few of those farms are now held over to dairying. As it is only 70 miles from Melbourne, some of the land is now actually used for grazing horses and all sorts of other activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the best quality land on the swamp has been soaked up for residential purposes. That has been a great disappointment to many of us living around that area. The member for Corangamite said that in the end our dairy industry is still vulnerable on the world market. We must be vigilant as to how we approach it. Improving best practice and quality control and modernising the industry have to be continual processes. We have to get better and better at what we do. Part of that, of course, has been the Bonlac process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the past there have been opportunities for the people in dairying in my area to grow potatoes on the side and run a few beef cattle. They have been a mixed group. We have had a bit of horticulture down the road. Now we have moved on. So it is with potatoes. We have become more specialised in what we do. If a person is a potato grower, he is a potato grower <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="683"> and nothing else. If he is a beef producer, that is what he does. That is how McMillan has moved, anyway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to talk about not only the world's best practice area but also the downside of our industry. The costs are going through the roof not only for the dairy industry but for everybody. It seems to me, living on the boundary of my electorate at Pakenham, that the world changes when you get to that boundary at Pakenham and start heading into the regional area of McMillan. When you get to Nar Nar Goon your petrol price goes up 20 per cent. Unless all farmers go to Dandenong every week&mdash;which they do not because they have a life to lead in their own community&mdash;they do not get the opportunity for those cheaper city petrol prices. They have to suffer the indignity of paying more than their city cousins for petrol.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The price of fertiliser has increased. The price of equipment is increasing and the equipment is becoming more high tech and larger. The price of feed is also increasing, as is the price of fuel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In other words, all the costs&mdash;whether they are for education for your children or for food&mdash;are increasing. Where did the former government really let down the industry and the families that work in it? It said in the 1993 campaign that it was not going to put on the imposts that the then opposition was proposing. What did it do? It increased the wholesale sales tax on nearly everything that goes into the domestic situation on a farm. It increased taxes right across the board. The prices of groceries were increased to those people. There was a de facto increase of tax up to 20 and 30 per cent at that time. That was pretty upsetting for most of the community who had trusted the government's word that there would not be increases. But the great indignity was the cost of fuel, whether it was unleaded or leaded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former member for this seat actually said at one stage, `All my farmers are having such a good time they are driving four&hyphen;wheel drives.' I met them in McMillan over the last 18 months while I was campaigning and they do not all drive four&hyphen;wheel drives. If they do, they do not drive new four&hyphen;wheel drives and, if they drive four&hyphen;wheel drives, they are probably on a farm where they need one in order to get access. That is what I found. It was not because of wealth. The great sadness is that to actually use a statement like `all my farmers are doing well' is unfair because we know we have an evolving community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned the reform that my own small community of Koo Wee Rup had gone through. I talked about the reform that the potato industry is now going through. At Thorpdale, Koo Wee Rup and Cora Lynn we were growing 60, 70, 80 or 300 acres of potatoes. They are now growing thousands of acres of potatoes in the northern part of Victoria, as many of you would know, and they are growing clean, very easily washed potatoes. Every time Thorpdale potatoes come onto the market, the price goes down because there is a flood of them and those potatoes have got that rich soil around them. There is going to be reform in that area. The dairy industry is reforming, trying to push an export market, and so is the potato industry. All these industries are moving.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Everybody in a country area has had to deal with reform&mdash;and the pain of reform. The small businesses that were down the road trading off those small farms&mdash;the potato farmers and the smaller family farms in the dairy industry&mdash;are no longer there. They have just gone. I do not think anybody in this room can name a Youngs any more. It was the family store. Is there a drapery store left in country Victoria? If there are one or two, they are not selling the range of goods they once sold. People have to travel. But that comes back to the costs of fuel again. I was going to say that those families do not have four&hyphen;wheel drives. They might have had <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="684"> a car but they needed two cars if they had children because they were moving children to sporting activities or to school or to do the shopping through the day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are not travelling 10 kilometres or a kilometre down the road to the Forest Hill shopping centre or whatever the shopping centre happens to be; they are travelling 50, 60 or 70 kilometres. I visited parts of Victoria continually for 18 months after I left this House&mdash;I did not leave voluntarily. I travelled the whole of Victoria and I met people out in rural Victoria who actually travelled 60 kilometres to town, sometimes three times a day, to participate in normal family activities. So that fuel impost became a huge impost on families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since I became the member for McMillan, it has seemed to me that when you cross the Toomuc Creek at Pakenham you are completely forgotten by politicians, who are mostly city based or suburb based. They are not out there enough to understand what it is like to actually live in a community in Moe, Morwell, Traralgon, Yinnar or any of those dairying or producing areas. They have no idea.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people out there recently said something to the Australian government. We must take those people seriously and never take them for granted, because what they actually said to us was, `Look, you people do not understand us. You have forgotten us. You have imposed the taxes. You do not care about us. You do not even put your hand up and say, "We are trying to do something about what is happening in regional Victoria."' Not once did I hear the former government say, `We feel the pain that is going on in the regions and we are prepared to address it in this way.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that, given the inspiration of this new government, we will have an opportunity to express ourselves as members who come from country Victoria or country New South Wales, Queensland or Western Australia, and say that those people out there are very important to what happens in Australia. People talk about `grassroots': `grassroots' is out in the country. That is where people actually see and feel what `grassroots' is all about. They talk about battlers in the city; let us remember we have got a few battlers in the country areas, too, especially in some of the regional seats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The seat of McMillan suffered, a long way back, not only with regard to the reform of the dairy industry and the way that process went through, but also in relation to the power generation industry. We had some 23,000 people working in the power generation and energy industry; we now have 3,000 to 4,000. This is massive change. All that has collapsed upon this regional community. The only people who have been prepared to apply themselves to what has happened outside the urban areas of the state&mdash;and, I dare say, other states&mdash;have been those in the state government. Hopefully, this government will in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had forgotten what a short time it seems when you have got much to say on issues, such as the dairy industry, about your own electorate. I had forgotten the passion with which members remind people of the issues in their own electorates. I had forgotten how much they see the land as important in their electorates, especially outside of Melbourne. There is no <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="685"> greater honour than to represent a seat such as McMillan. I am humbled to be able to represent the seat I have lived in for the whole of my life and to begin to address issues such as dairy industry issues in regard to the bill that we are discussing today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some things that I want to mention about the dairy industry. One is that it has never stopped training young people. At the McMillan VCAH Campus outside Warragul there is a very special program, at the moment, which takes on people as apprentices in the dairy industry. I do not think we have done enough training; I do not think you can ever do enough training in any industry that you are in. In our area, the dairy industry is taking an active part and actually plays a role in what is happening with these young people, who are going onto dairy farms and learning the processes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former government went wrong when it never did a family impact statement to determine what was happening to people in rural communities, or a family impact statement on the effects of bills that go before this House. Before the election we said to the people of Australia, `When we introduce a bill, whatever that bill is, we are going to look at the impact that it will have on families, on family farms, on family businesses, and on families who work in cities or in country areas.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that family impact statements will come before this Main Committee and before the parliament because if we cannot decide how legislation affects the family unit, how it affects individuals, then we are failing the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After spending the next three years in this parliament I do not want to look back on my time in the parliament and say, `Like the previous government, we failed to look at the impact of legislation on families.' We have to do everything in this House we possibly can to uphold the family unit and we have to do everything we can to maintain our determination to look after the family unit. We want to encourage the family farm and encourage the family businesses that create the wealth. They are the wealth creators in our electorates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember the training levy that has now fallen in a hole. I was in the parliament when that was introduced and I said then, `This will not be a goer for the Australian community.' We were howled down at the time but it has been proved that it is not a goer for the Australian community. Commonsense is coming finally to our family farms and to our communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank you for giving me the opportunity to address these amendments to the Dairy Produce Amendment Bill. I look forward to supporting the dairy farmers in my electorate of McMillan. They play a major role in the provision of wealth in the whole of the electorate. They will continue to play that role as long as we as a parliament are prepared to support them by getting out of their lives and letting them get on with what they do best. What they do best is work hard. They play hard too but they work hard and they produce very well for this nation. Thank you very much.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These bills are going to reinforce some changes that were implemented last year. They had their genesis in the establishment of the GATT agreement and prior to that in the establishment of the milk levy under the so&hyphen;called Kerin plan. I was not involved in the federal parliament then but I was certainly involved in my local community and it has a fairly extensive dairy industry. Certainly it is not as large as exists in the electorates of my Victorian colleagues sitting in front of me but still it is a very important rural industry in my electorate.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="686">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of representing the dairy industry in my electorate I have always had contact with key people in the New South Wales section of the dairy industry. Going back all those years to the start of the Kerin plan, I point out that that plan was precipitated by a bit of tension between the New South Wales and Victorian dairy industries.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="McARTHUR" NAMEID="VH4">

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SU5">Mr VAILE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Importantly, it was the industry that took action to create a set of circumstances under which the industry could work and prosper. Certainly it has prospered since then.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we had the advent of the GATT agreement and the World Trade Organisation, which Australia is signatory to. I will still maintain my limited support of that, as I have stated on many occasions in this place in the last three years. I maintain that Australia and the government of the day were very rash in their moves to lead the world as far as tariff reduction was concerned. There is evidence of that in some of the available figures concerning what is happening in the United States with the support of their dairy industry and export markets, compared with ours, and what I call, to a certain extent, the corrupt attitude of a lot of the agricultural trading nations of the world. There does not seem to be the amount of bona fides and the commitment to these tariff reductions in other countries that there has been in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot of people would argue that there have been benefits. Sure, I think we have to go down that path. But as far as I am concerned&mdash;and I am only a lay person in these things&mdash;I do not believe it has been equitably done. We have been reducing our tariffs at a greater rate than some of the other participants in that agreement. We are never going to reach the same level because it is a percentage reduction each year, not a percentage of or getting down to a percentage tariff. That makes it doubly difficult. It makes it extremely difficult for people in our rural industries to compete in the world market place, particularly&mdash;as the member for McMillan (Mr Broadbent) so rightly pointed out&mdash;as previous governments have paid scant regard to the input costs of industry in Australia, particularly rural industries. Our rural industries have a factor that other industries do not have to deal with and that is the climate. They have been affected detrimentally in recent years by that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is something that people in the rest of Australia sometimes have a great deal of difficulty coming to terms with. They ask: why should we, the taxpayers of Australia, be lending our support to people in those industries? But the taxpayers of Australia go to work in the morning and come home at night and at the end of the week their wages are transferred into their bank accounts, particularly in this city where there are more than 300,000 people. There are some very good people who work in this city. But a lot of the people who work in this city have not had the experience of what it takes to actually physically generate income; it is just there in the bank at the end of each week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People in Australia should have a greater understanding of what crises face people on the land from time to time and the difficulties that they face in producing a very important part of the wealth of this nation. We are&mdash;and for a long, long time into the future will always be&mdash;a commodity trading nation. We should not lose sight of that fact. We need to be developing our manufacturing industries; we need to be developing our IT industries to compete and to work in the world marketplace. But just bear in mind that we are always going to be a major exporter of agricultural and mining products. They are going to form, for many years to come, the backbone of our economy.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="687">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of the implementation of the World Trade Organisation in the middle of last year, it became necessary for the then minister and the industry generally to address the mechanisms that were in place for the all milk levy. It was deemed prior to that date that the way they were implemented was actually illegal under GATT. I questioned that at the time in a speech that I made in this very chamber about that issue. To be a member of that trading club we have got to play by those rules, whether we agree with them or not, and go down that path.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bills that we have before us today are about making the activities taking place in the industry better reflected in legislation. I would just like to make a comparison of the two support mechanisms, between us and the US. I acknowledge that it is a sensitive issue and that the minister is here, but it is important. This information update on the dairy industry is dated April 1996, so it is reasonably recent. In it there is a fair bit said about what is happening in the US as far as their dairy industry and their dairy export incentive program are concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In recent years, our market has been the subject of the wheat export enhancement program under a recent farm bill. The most recent farm bill is directing support mechanisms at our dairy industry Asian marketplace. The update says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The US announced on 1 April target destinations for sales of subsidised product under the DEIP program. Second&hyphen;quarter allocations were generally unchanged, including 48,000t of SMP (10,000t to Asia), 4,000t of WMP. . . . SMP sales to Asia under the March quarter allocation totalled 7,119t at an average subsidy of US$475/t. The indicative fob price of around US$1,950/t was below Australian contractual prices during the first quarter. Domestic production figures for the first two months of 1996 show a definite switching by producers from butter/SMP production to cheese production. Wholesale cheese for processing prices during March and April were at seasonally high levels, around US$3,000/t. Butter and SMP production were three per cent, and six per cent lower at 110,460t and 87,050t respectively.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Presidential approval was given in early April to the 1996&hyphen;2000 US Farm Bill. The Bill legislates for a gradual phasing out of the dairy minimum price support program over a four&hyphen;year period.</PARA>
<PARA>The accompanying table indicates&mdash;this is very interesting&mdash;in Australian cents per litre terms, that the support being provided in the US in 1996 is 32.2 cents per litre, and that it is phasing down over four years at the end of 1999 to 30.8 cents. They have 30.8 Australian cents per litre support. It is a fair difference from what we have got that is being provided predominantly by the producers for their own industry to maintain their competitiveness on the world market. The document goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, farmgate payments for manufacturing milk have generally been substantially above support levels in the 1990s. (Farmgate manufacturing milk prices in Australia in 1994&hyphen;95 averaged 24 Aus. cents per litre.)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill funds&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is the farm bill&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the export program Dairy Export Incentive Program through to 2002, up to Uruguay Round limits on subsidised volumes. The National Dairy Board will also be able to budget for export market development.</PARA>
<PARA>So my view is that we have always moved ahead of the game in tariff reduction, in terms of subsidy reduction. We have wanted to be shining white knights leading the way in this area, whereas a lot of our trading opposition is working to the absolute limits of the margin, and if it can fudge over the edge, it will.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="688">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is incumbent upon this government&mdash;and I have made that abundantly clear to the minister at the table and also to the Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer)&mdash;that we take a fairly hard&hyphen;nosed attitude in our trade negotiations when we are in those forums, talking about these things. It is incumbent upon this government to do everything that is humanly possible in the interests of our rural industries. I assure the House that that will certainly be the case.</PARA>

As with all major manufacturing primary production industries, that process had to take place and we have yet to see more such processes in other agricultural industries. In the dairy industry, the production units became bigger, more viable and more equitable as far as their equity ratios were concerned.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All we have to do now is to implement micro-economic reform at the next stage in the process on the transportation side&mdash;on the wharves and so on&mdash;to keep faith with the dairy industry as a major export industry. As it is in place now, the mechanism sees a contribution coming from a couple of different sections of the industry. A manufacturer's levy of 4c a litre is collected and put into the market support fund. A market milk levy of 2c a litre from producers goes into the fund. The fund provides market support of 2.2c a litre to producers of market milk. Presumably this mechanism makes the thing GATT&hyphen;legal because we are dealing with the domestic situation, not a direct export enhancement situation.</PARA></TALK.START>

A lot of private players in this industry are making great strides as far as exports are concerned. One dairy factory in Taree is developing a new product and selling labelled product, not just generic product, into Asia that is earning a lot of export dollars for Australia, and doing it extremely well.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="689">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is all about supporting the industry as a whole, but it still begs the question. In the US farm bill, by 1999 they are looking at 30.8c Australian per litre support in the US. Interestingly, one paragraph says:</PARA>

<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">It says `up to'. They are going to work to the margins all the way. They are going to make us earn every export dollar that our industry can. Because it is a major export earner, this industry in this country deserves every little bit of support from both sides of this House. It has certainly reconstructed itself without the absorption or the subsidy that a lot of other industries have had. The dairy industry would have loved to have had the hundreds of millions of dollars that were spent in reform on the waterfront&mdash;the Clayton's reform on the waterfront that did not really have any effect. The dairy industry would have loved that sort of public funding in its restructuring process.</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It might be a disingenuous comment, but it is a factual one. We have got to keep supporting this industry in these ways so we can facilitate what they are doing for themselves. More than that, we have to support this industry and our other major primary, manufacturing and mining industries in this country so they can get on with the job of micro-economic reform. Mr Deputy Speaker, this government will do that. Make no bones about it, the people of Australia need not be concerned as to whether this government has the backbone to do it. It certainly does. Before my time expires, I go back to the comment by the member for McMillan that the dairy industry is one of those major training grounds for young people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some of the labour market programs that were put in place in recent years that are working within the dairy industry. They do train young people&mdash;there are dairying apprenticeships in the industry&mdash;and we do not want to see those young people lost to the industry. That raises the point that while it is good to train someone, it is not an apprenticeship that can take place in a matter of years. It takes quite a few years because it is not just about a job, it is about a lifestyle. The way it is done involves a great deal of commitment to the industry and what it is doing, and a love of rural industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next question that raises is about the intergenerational change of farms and how people afford the financial arrangements needed to do that. With the intergenerational change in a family farm, how does the retiring dairy farmer get out, when he wants to leave that production unit to his family, and still be able to live? My personal view is that the mechanisms that are in place now are not suitable and certainly need review. We have to look at all those issues if we expect to maintain viable rural industries in Australia. That goes not just for the dairy industry, but for all our rural industries. So it is very important that we look at the financial mechanisms to enable intergenerational transfer of some of our most important industries in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am supporting the two bills that are before the House this morning and the way that the government has moved in its support for the dairy industry. Some of the industry leaders come from my electorate, which has always produced a number of the major industry leaders in New South Wales. They have my full support and they certainly know where I stand on the dairy industry. All Australians should recognise that this industry has done the hard yards, predominantly by themselves financially, sorted it out and got themselves into one of the most <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="690"> efficient producing industries in Australia that is earning much needed export dollars for this nation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you. I would like to begin by thanking all who have participated in this debate. There is obviously strong support across the political spectrum for Australia's dairy industry and a recognition that this debate is centred on some straightforward administrative amendments which in no way represent significant policy change and are a further tidying up&mdash;if I can use that sort of terminology&mdash;of the reinstrumentation of the old all&hyphen;milk levy arrangements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They were, in my view, a very clever industry funded and industry driven set of export enhancement arrangements which played a significant part in boosting the export performance of the dairy industry. Over the last couple of decades, it has turned from being a rather parochial and inward looking industry with quite a few deep&hyphen;rooted structural problems&mdash;very low levels of farm profitability, low levels of efficiency, and supplying essentially the domestic market&mdash;into one which is now aggressively outward looking and is really setting the pace in terms of export performance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments bring us into line with our international obligations as a nation which is not only a signatory to the WTO but an originator and driver of the whole push for trade reform in the agricultural area. So I do place on record my appreciation for the contributions made to this debate by people from both sides of politics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to recap briefly on some of the remarks that have been made about the performance of the dairy industry. We can be genuinely proud of it. It is generally assumed now that we can wear the cap as the world's second most efficient dairy producer&mdash;only New Zealand is generally perceived to still have a bit of an edge on us.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4K4">Mr ANDERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry, Mr Deputy Speaker; I will oblige and refer my remarks through you. The point ought to be made that the dairy industry has achieved much of what it has achieved through effective leadership. I have said publicly that I do have a concern that the wool industry could learn well from the model set before it, in as much as I note with some delight that the various sectors of the wool industry have recently begun to cooperate more and are not publicly criticising one another in the way that they had been in the past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The wool industry is one that, in my view, needs to engage in a greater degree of fermentation, if you like, of leadership from within its own ranks, and to push that leadership up and then support it, get behind it and make it all happen. I say that with the best will in the world, because I have some concerns that we need to do for the wool industry what the dairy industry successfully managed to achieve for itself in recent years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have actually seen the dairy industry set a scorching pace in Asia. We hear a lot in this country about how our future lies in Asia and that is where the opportunities will be. Yet the reality is that, because we have been so reluctant to grapple with effective reform in this country, our market share in expanding Asian markets in many ways&mdash;and in a wide range of products&mdash;has been slipping. It has not been increasing, but slipping&mdash;an appalling indictment of economic, industrial relations and taxation policy under the regime that has in this country just been comprehensively booted out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In contrast&mdash;and in a moment I will come to some of the historical reasons that the dairy industry has been able to achieve a few things that others have not&mdash;dairy has seen its share of the lucrative Asian markets increase over recent years from an already impressive 29 per cent to 34 per cent last year. Currently, it has over one billion dollars worth of exports on an annualised basis. That is a performance of which the rest of the Australian community ought to be very proud; but, at the same time, we ought to be enormously challenged by it. It is in fact a model of what we all ought to be doing but cannot do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Look at the meat industry, where we are being pushed back out of Asia. Why? Largely because it is an industry based not on cooperation but on confrontation, particularly at the level of industrial relations. One reason that the dairy industry has made such great progress is that one of the great things that it had going for it&mdash;even though 20 years ago it was fragmented, small and rather inward&hyphen;looking&mdash;was that it was built on a cooperative model. It was built on an understanding that there needed to be good linkages between all of the players: between the dairy farmers themselves and the cooperatives that they formed and the activities of the cooperatives, including those of an industrial relations nature.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They were largely decentralised, too, out in rural Australia, and sometimes I suspect it was a little difficult for the agitators and others who would have made trouble to get out there and organise. As a result of its cooperative approach, the dairy industry has made tremendous progress. You will be only too well aware, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;representing, as you do, a rural region in this country&mdash;that very many farm families enjoy extraordinarily low income levels or even negative income levels; but the dairy industry is one of the great exceptions. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="692"> It varies a little from state to state, but the average farm operating surplus on Australia's dairy farms will be in the order of $60,000 to $65,000 this year, and that is a tremendous result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, players are always a little like that other great industry that is doing reasonably well at the moment: the sugar industry. When you talk to them and say, `Isn't it marvellous to see your industry doing well?' they all say, `Ah, yes! But, before you think of making any government changes that might impact on us, it won't be so good next year. Remember that these things are cyclical.' And that is probably a timely warning.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the minister gets on to lambs and pork and other things, I would remind him that, while we have dealt with wool and now sugar, the dairy industry is the subject of the bill.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4K4">Mr ANDERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, but these are all important points because they have to do with recognising the challenge set by this outstanding industry. We are reinforcing its capacity to continue to set a scorching pace and an example that the rest of us need to be following. Nonetheless, with all due deference to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will refer to the matter in hand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the interesting things is recognising the potential for the industry in Australia and the ideal nature of our geographic position in relation to Asia. We are now seeing significant investment by companies such as Nestle&mdash;again in the Goulburn Valley in particular&mdash;and, interestingly enough, by the Japanese, with Snow brand, for example, producing skim milk powder and baby milk formula. That constitutes a recognition by the Japanese that, as the old protectionist policies are wound back in their homelands, competitive suppliers like Australia will have an ever greater potential for the future and that they ought to be in here on the ground floor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been to the Goulburn Valley a few times now and I have seen what is happening there. It is very exciting and it is reflected in many, many other areas of Australia, even in north&hyphen;western New South Wales, where there are now a significant number of dairy operators who are buying up country inland because they can extract a return there that other farmers cannot from their activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I noticed the previous speaker touched on the United States and their trading practices. We note, and I have had the good fortune to put this to the Americans in the last couple of days, that their farm bill does in fact make some very significant and worthwhile reforms. For the first time since the program was set up by Roosevelt in the 1930s, the income support programs will be decoupled from production. That is very welcome, but there are a couple of things we do not welcome. One is that both EEP and DIEP, the dairy industry export program, remain. They actually have not used EEP for grains since July of last year because grain prices are high and they have not needed them. But, as the previous speaker pointed out, they are quite aggressively, within the very clear boundaries of what they are allowed to do under WTO&mdash;as opposed to perhaps the spirit of WTO&mdash;using DIEP to the outer limits. It appears that that is the objective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are seeking assurances from the Americans that they will respect the undertakings that they have given us not to harm Australia, as a non&hyphen;subsidising nation and one that is not supposedly in their sights in terms of their engagement with the Europeans, and that they will seek to protect our interests. We sincerely hope that they will be able to, in a comprehensive and integrated way, honour those broad commitments. We do not mind competing with the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="693"> world's best&mdash;we think we can cream them in a lot of ways&mdash;but we do not want to do that in an environment where people have unfairly funded&mdash;taxpayer funded&mdash;advantages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That brings me to a couple of closing remarks about the New Zealanders, who are also very aggressive, very powerful competitors and who have a very major dairy export industry&mdash;I think they export over 90 per cent of their dairy product. They are a major player on the world stage in this regard. They have progressed further and faster down the reform road than we have. This does raise some issues for us. I would put those in a couple of categories. One is that we would require of the New Zealanders that they do everything to honour the gentleman's agreement that we have with them in terms of access to our markets because we do not impose the levy that we are talking about here in this legislation&mdash;in terms of minor amendments to the legislation&mdash;on them when they sell their products on our shelves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That, of course, does constitute something of an advantage for them. They have given us an undertaking that they will not take advantage of that situation and we would be very keen to see that gentlemen's agreement upheld. Again, I can confirm to you that I have taken that issue up personally with the New Zealanders. They have responded in good faith, in an appropriate way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, to build on that, it does indicate the need for us to get on with urgent reforms&mdash;and there are many of them on the government's agenda which are important to the dairy industry. I do not intend to talk at length now about appropriate structures, and so forth, for the dairy industry. Broadly speaking, a lot of that work has been done. The right economic environment is obviously important, fixing the big black hole so that we can ensure that interest rates are as globally competitive, if you like, as they can be. That is what you need when you are in an export industry in this country&mdash;interest rates that allow you to be globally competitive. We do not have them, largely because of past economic policy. Those sorts of things do need to be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one area I want to touch on finally. One of our great competitive advantages in Asia springs from our clean, green image. It is no secret that, whilst our product is clean and green, there are challenges before us in primary industry in this country if we are to maintain that clean and green image and to continue to produce sustainably. Again, many of those challenges are evident in southern New South Wales and northern Victoria as we attempt to battle such issues as salinity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition government has a very comprehensive landcare package which incorporates such things as tax rebates and credits for farmers. They are an ideal mechanism both to facilitate the farmer&mdash;who, in the end, spends the bulk of the money and does the work on landcare initiatives, be they salinity or whatever, to meet sustainable agricultural objectives&mdash;and to let the community, which has a great vested interest in sustainable production, make an investment as well. The community gets a great return from that investment, not just in terms of more jobs and more taxes paid to Treasury, but also in terms of being able to secure the resource base for future generations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tax credit rebate approach is an ideal part of that armoury. It is also part and parcel of our environment package and I again issue the challenge: if you want what is undoubtedly the best environment&hyphen;landcare&hyphen;environmentally sustainable production package ever put before the Australian people in this country, it needs to be recognised that the approach we have put up, with a $1 billion Natural Heritage Trust to be funded out of the partial privatisation of Telstra, is sound policy that cannot be legitimately resisted by anybody who has a proper, deep <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="694"> and sincere commitment to these issues of sound environmental management and sustainable agricultural production.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thank you for your indulgence. I believe the issues that I have touched on are important. But, in particular, I again want to thank all who have participated in the debate very sincerely indeed, both for their contribution and for their agreement to the objectives sought here today.</PARA>
